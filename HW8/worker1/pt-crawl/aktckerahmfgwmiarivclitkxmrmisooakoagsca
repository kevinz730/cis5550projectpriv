the 
balloons 
that 
were
to 
destroy 
the 
French, 
and 
despite 
all 
the 
nonsense 
Rostopchin 
wrote 
in
his 
broadsheets. 
They 
knew 
that 
it 
was 
for 
the 
army 
to 
fight, 
and 
that
if 
it 
could 
not 
succeed 
it 
would 
not 
do 
to 
take 
young 
ladies 
and 
house
serfs 
to 
the 
Three 
Hills 
quarter 
of 
Moscow 
to 
fight 
Napoleon, 
and 
that
they 
must 
go 
away, 
sorry 
as 
they 
were 
to 
abandon 
their 
property
to 
destruction. 
They 
went 
away 
without 
thinking 
of 
the 
tremendous
significance 
of 
that 
immense 
and 
wealthy 
city 
being 
given 
over 
to
destruction, 
for 
a 
great 
city 
with 
wooden 
buildings 
was 
certain 
when
abandoned 
<a href="/aVzUge/Qc2leWib7tHLaX3ohMq.html">by</a> 
its 
inhabitants 
to 
be 
burned. 
They 
went 
away 
each 
on 
his
own 
account,<p>
and 
yet 
it 
was 
only 
in 
consequence 
of 
their 
going 
away
that 
the 
momentous 
event 
was 
accomplished 
that 
will 
always 
remain 
the
greatest 
glory 
of 
the 
Russian 
people. 
The 
lady 
who, 
afraid 
of 
being
stopped 
by 
Count 
Rostopchin's 
orders, 
had 
already 
in 
June 
moved 
with 
her
Negroes 
and 
her 
women 
jesters 
from 
Moscow 
to 
her 
Saratov 
estate, 
with
a 
vague 
consciousness 
that 
she 
was 
not 
Bonaparte's 
servant, 
was 
really,
simply, 
and 
truly 
carrying 
out 
the 
great 
work 
which 
saved 
Russia. 
But
Count 
Rostopchin, 
who 
now 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ox4Nec7rqw2XZEHJ.html">taunted</a> 
those 
who 
left 
Moscow 
and 
now 
had 
the
government 
offices 
removed; 
now 
distributed 
quite 
useless 
weapons 
to
the 
drunken 
rabble; 
now 
had 
processions 
displaying 
the 
icons, 
and 
now
forbade 
Father 
Augustin 
to 
remove 
icons 
or 
the 
relics 
of 
saints; 
now
seized 
all 
the 
private 
carts 
in 
Moscow 
and 
on 
one 
hundred 
and 
thirty-six
of 
them 
removed 
the 
balloon 
that 
was 
being 
constructed 
by 
Leppich; 
now
hinted 
that 
he 
would 
burn 
Moscow 
and 
related 
how 
he 
had 
set 
fire 
to 
his
own 
house; 
now 
wrote 
a 
proclamation 
to 
the 
French 
solemnly 
upbraiding
them 
for 
having 
destroyed 
his 
Orphanage; 
now 
claimed 
the 
glory 
of
having 
hinted 
that 
he 
would 
burn 
Moscow 
and 
now 
repudiated 
the 
deed;
now 
ordered 
the 
people 
to 
catch 
all 
spies 
and 
bring 
them 
to 
him, 
and 
now
reproached<p>
them 
for 
doing 
so; 
now 
expelled 
all 
the 
French 
residents 
from
Moscow, 
and 
now 
allowed 
Madame 
Aubert-Chalme 
(the 
center 
of 
the 
whole
French 
colony 
in 
Moscow) 
to 
remain, 
but 
ordered 
the 
venerable 
old
postmaster 
Klyucharev 
to 
be 
arrested 
and 
exiled 
for 
no 
particular
offense; 
now 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Cc3mGGRm7qQqw5.html">assembled</a> 
the 
people 
at 
the 
Three 
Hills 
to 
fight 
the 
French
and 
now, 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
them, 
handed 
over 
to 
them 
a 
man 
to 
be 
killed
and 
himself 
drove 
away 
by 
a 
back 
gate; 
now 
declared 
that 
he 
would
not 
survive 
the 
fall 
of 
Moscow, 
and 
now 
wrote 
French 
verses 
in 
albums
concerning 
his 
share 
in 
the 
affair-this 
man 
did 
not 
understand 
the
meaning 
of 
what 
was 
happening 
but 
merely 
wanted 
to 
do 
something 
himself
that
