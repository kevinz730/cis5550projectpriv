a 
dancing 
lesson.

The 
member 
of 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/fF3Gbiq6WMNlO3L.html">Hofkriegsrath</a> 
looked 
at 
him 
severely 
but, 
<a href="/aVzUge/Jn9UDh8Sdo0.html">seeing</a> 
the
seriousness 
of 
his 
stupid 
smile, 
could 
not 
but 
give 
him 
a 
moment's
attention. 
He 
screwed 
up 
his 
eyes 
showing 
that 
he 
was 
listening.

"I 
have 
the 
honor 
to 
congratulate 
you. 
General 
Mack 
has 
arrived, 
quite
well, 
only 
a 
little 
bruised 
just 
here," 
he 
added, 
pointing 
with 
a
beaming 
smile 
to 
his 
head.

The 
general 
frowned, 
turned

and 
went 
on.

"Gott, 
wie 
naiv!"

said 
he 
angrily, 
after 
he 
had 
gone 
a 
few 
steps.

"Good 
God,<p>
what 
simplicity!"


Nesvitski 
with 
a 
laugh 
threw 
his 
arms 
round 
Prince 
Andrew, 
but
Bolkonski, 
turning 
still 
paler, 
<a href="/nocrawl/c8Rhi6R/lg9Nc7vC8w.html">pushed</a> 
him 
away 
with 
an 
angry 
look 
and
turned 
to 
Zherkov.

nervous 
irritation

Mack,
