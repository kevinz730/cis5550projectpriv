began 
wailing 
plaintively:

"Oh, 
you 
fine 
fellows, 
my 
kind, 
kind 
friends! 
These 
are 
men! 
Oh, 
my
brave, 
kind 
friends," 
and 
he 
leaned 
his 
head 
against 
the 
shoulder 
of 
one
of 
the 
men 
like 
a 
child.

Meanwhile 
Morel 
was 
sitting<p>
in 
the 
best 
place 
by<p>
the 
fire, 
surrounded 
by
the 
soldiers.

Morel, 
a 
short 
sturdy 
Frenchman 
with 
inflamed 
and 
streaming 
<a href="/cZl/CQf1fnBp0ML.html">eyes,</a> 
was
wearing 
a 
woman's 
cloak 
and 
had 
a 
shawl 
tied 
woman 
fashion 
round 
his
head 
over 
his 
cap. 
He 
was 
evidently 
tipsy, 
and 
was 
singing 
a 
French 
song
in 
a 
hoarse 
broken 
voice, 
with 
an 
arm 
thrown 
round 
the 
nearest 
soldier.
The 
soldiers 
simply<p>
held 
their 
sides 
as 
they 
watched 
him.

"Now 
then, 
now 
then, 
teach 
us 
how 
it 
goes! 
I'll 
soon 
pick 
it 
up. 
How 
is
it?" 
said 
the 
man-a 
singer 
and 
a 
wag-whom 
Morel 
was 
embracing.

"Vive 
Henri 
Quatre! 
Vive 
ce 
roi 
valiant!" 
sang 
Morel, 
winking. 
"Ce
diable 
a 
quatre..." 
*

 
 
 
 
 
* 
"Long 
live 
Henry 
the 
Fourth, 
that 
valiant 
king! 
That 
rowdy
 
 
 
 
 
devil."


"Vivarika! 
Vif-seruvaru! 
Sedyablyaka!" 
repeated 
the 
soldier, 
flourishing
his<p>
arm 
and 
really 
catching 
the 
tune.

"Bravo! 
Ha, 
ha, 
ha!" 
rose 
their 
rough, 
joyous 
laughter 
from 
all 
sides.

Morel, 
wrinkling 
up 
his 
face, 
laughed 
too.

"Well, 
go 
on, 
go 
on!"

 
 
<p>
 
"Qui 
eut 
le 
triple 
talent,
 
 
 
 
De 
boire, 
de 
battre,
 
 
 
 
Et 
d'etre 
un 
vert 
galant." 
*

 
 
 
 
 
 
* 
Who 
had 
a 
triple 
talent
 
 
 
 
 
 
For 
drinking, 
for 
fighting,
 
 
 
 
 
 
And 
for 
being 
a 
gallant 
old 
boy...

"It 
goes<p>
smoothly, 
too. 
Well, 
now, 
Zaletaev!"

"Ke..." 
Zaletaev, 
brought 
out 
with 
effort: 
"ke-e-e-e," 
he 
<a href="/cZl/hMv2O3INZ2RHS.html">drawled,
laboriously</a> 
pursing 
his 
lips, 
"le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, 
e
de-tra-va-ga-la" 
he 
sang.

"Fine! 
Just 
like 
the 
Frenchie! 
Oh, 
ho 
ho! 
Do 
you 
want 
some 
more 
to 
eat?"

"Give 
him 
some 
porridge: 
it 
takes 
a 
long 
time 
to 
get 
filled 
up 
after
starving."

They 
gave 
him 
some 
more 
porridge 
and 
Morel 
with 
a 
laugh 
set 
to 
work 
on
his 
third 
bowl. 
All 
the 
young 
soldiers 
smiled 
gaily 
as 
they 
watched 
him.
The 
older 
men, 
who 
thought 
it 
undignified 
to 
amuse 
themselves 
with 
such
nonsense, 
continued 
to 
lie 
at 
the 
opposite 
side 
of 
the 
fire, 
but 
one
would 
occasionally 
raise 
himself 
on 
an 
elbow 
and 
glance 
at 
Morel 
with 
a
smile.

"They 
are 
men 
too," 
said 
one 
of 
them 
as 
he 
wrapped 
himself 
up 
in 
his
coat. 
"Even 
wormwood 
grows 
on 
<a href="/cZl/qi7VEt8ddue3ka.html">its</a> 
own 
root."

"O 
Lord, 
O 
Lord! 
How 
starry 
it 
is! 
Tremendous! 
That 
means 
a 
hard
frost...."

They 
all 
grew 
silent. 
The 
stars, 
as 
if 
knowing 
that 
no 
one 
was 
looking
at 
them, 
began 
to 
disport 
themselves 
in 
the 
dark 
sky: 
now 
flaring
up, 
now 
vanishing, 
now 
trembling, 
they 
were 
busy 
whispering 
something
gladsome 
and 
mysterious 
to 
one 
another.





CHAPTER 
X

The 
French 
army 
melted 
away 
at 
the 
uniform 
rate 
of 
a 
mathematical
progression; 
and 
that 
crossing 
of 
the 
Berezina 
about 
which 
so 
much 
has
been 
written 
was 
only 
one 
intermediate 
stage 
in 
its 
destruction, 
and
not 
at 
all 
the 
decisive 
episode 
of 
the 
campaign. 
If 
so 
much 
has 
been
and 
still 
is 
written 
about 
the 
Berezina, 
on 
the 
French 
side 
this 
is 
only
because 
at 
the 
broken 
bridge 
across 
that 
river 
the 
calamities 
their 
army
had 
been 
previously 
enduring 
were 
suddenly 
concentrated 
at 
one 
moment
into 
a 
tragic 
spectacle 
that 
remained 
in 
every 
memory, 
and 
on 
the
Russian 
side
