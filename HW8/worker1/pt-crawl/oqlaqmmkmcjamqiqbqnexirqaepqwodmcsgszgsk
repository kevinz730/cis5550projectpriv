recognized

philosophizing

with<p>
pleasure.

"Some

Tushin.

Just 
then 
there 
was 
a 
whistle 
in 
the 
air; 
nearer 
and
nearer, 
faster 
and 
louder, 
louder 
and 
faster, 
a 
cannon 
ball, 
as

The

to 
groan 
at 
the 
terrible 
impact.

And 
immediately 
Tushin, 
with 
a 
short 
pipe 
in 
the 
corner 
of 
his 
mouth
and 
his 
kind, 
intelligent 
face 
rather 
pale, 
rushed 
out 
of 
the 
shed
followed 
by 
the 
<a href="/cZl/jD5ZR0R4H.html">owner</a> 
of 
the 
manly 
voice, 
a 
dashing 
infantry 
officer

hurried 
off

CHAPTER 
XVII

Mounting 
his 
horse 
again 
Prince 
Andrew 
lingered 
with 
the 
battery,
looking 
at 
the 
puff 
from 
the 
gun 
that 
had 
sent 
the 
ball. 
His 
eyes
ran 
rapidly 
over 
the 
wide 
space, 
but 
he 
only 
saw 
that 
the 
hitherto
motionless 
masses 
of 
the 
French 
now 
swayed 
and 
that 
there 
really 
was
a 
battery 
to 
their 
left. 
The 
smoke 
above 
it 
had 
not 
yet 
dispersed. 
Two
mounted 
Frenchmen, 
probably 
adjutants, 
were 
galloping 
up 
the 
hill. 
A
small 
but 
distinctly 
visible<p>
enemy 
column 
was 
moving 
down 
the 
hill,
probably 
to 
strengthen 
the 
front 
line. 
The 
smoke 
of 
the 
first 
shot 
had
not 
yet 
<a href="/cZl/CB8WVP1GiG3.html">dispersed</a> 
before 
another 
puff 
appeared, 
followed 
by 
a 
report.
The 
battle 
<a href="/cZl/pX1Xjv6mGGRm7rq.html">had</a> 
begun! 
Prince 
Andrew 
turned 
his 
horse 
and 
galloped 
back
to 
Grunth 
to 
find 
Prince 
Bagration. 
He 
heard 
the 
cannonade 
behind 
him
growing 
louder 
and 
more 
frequent. 
Evidently 
our 
guns 
had 
begun 
to 
reply.
From 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
slope, 
where 
the 
parleys 
had 
taken 
place, 
came
the 
report 
of 
musketry.

Lemarrois 
had 
just 
arrived 
at 
a 
gallop 
with 
Bonaparte's 
stern 
letter,
and 
Murat, 
humiliated 
and 
anxious 
to 
expiate 
his 
fault, 
had 
at 
once
moved 
his 
forces 
to 
attack
