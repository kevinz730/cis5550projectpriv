The 
soldiers,
for 
the 
most 
part 
handsome 
fellows 
and, 
as 
is 
always 
the 
case 
in 
an
artillery 
company, 
a 
head 
and 
shoulders 
taller 
and 
twice 
as 
broad
as 
their 
officer-all 
looked 
at 
their 
commander 
like 
children 
in 
an
embarrassing 
situation, 
and 
the 
expression 
on 
his 
face 
was 
invariably
reflected 
on 
theirs.

Owing 
to 
the 
terrible 
uproar 
and 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/Bx6b5BYyw6v.html">necessity</a> 
for 
concentration 
and
activity, 
Tushin 
did 
not 
experience 
the 
slightest 
unpleasant 
sense 
of
fear, 
and 
the 
thought 
that 
he 
might 
be 
killed 
or 
badly 
wounded 
never
occurred 
to 
him. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
he 
became 
more 
and 
more 
elated. 
It
seemed 
to 
him 
that 
it 
was 
a<p>
very 
long 
time 
ago, 
almost 
a 
day, 
since 
he
had 
first 
seen 
the 
enemy 
and 
fired 
the 
first 
shot, 
and 
that 
the 
corner
of 
the 
field 
he 
stood 
on 
was 
well-known 
and 
familiar 
ground. 
Though 
he
thought 
of 
everything, 
considered 
everything, 
and 
did 
everything 
the
best 
of 
officers 
could 
do 
in 
his 
position, 
he 
was 
in 
a<p>
state 
akin 
to
feverish 
delirium 
or 
drunkenness.

From 
the 
deafening 
sounds 
of 
his 
own 
guns 
around 
him, 
the 
whistle 
and
thud 
of 
the 
enemy's 
cannon 
balls, 
from 
the 
flushed 
and 
perspiring
faces 
of 
the 
crew 
bustling 
round 
the 
guns, 
from 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
blood
of 
men 
and 
horses, 
from 
the 
little 
puffs 
of 
smoke 
on 
the 
enemy's 
side
(always 
followed 
by 
a 
ball 
flying 
past 
and 
striking 
the 
earth, 
a 
man, 
a
gun, 
a 
horse), 
from 
the 
sight 
of 
all 
these 
things 
a 
fantastic 
world 
of
his 
own 
had 
taken 
possession 
of 
his 
brain 
and 
at 
that 
moment 
afforded
him 
pleasure. 
The 
enemy's 
guns 
were 
in 
his 
fancy 
not 
guns 
but 
pipes
from 
which 
occasional 
puffs 
were 
blown 
by 
an 
invisible 
smoker.

"There... 
he's 
puffing 
again," 
muttered 
Tushin 
to 
himself, 
as 
a
small 
cloud 
rose 
from 
the 
hill 
and 
was 
borne 
in 
a 
streak 
to 
the 
left 
by
the 
wind.

"Now 
look 
out 
for 
the 
ball... 
we'll 
throw 
it 
back."

"What 
do 
you 
want, 
your 
honor?" 
asked 
an 
artilleryman, 
standing
close 
by, 
who 
heard 
him 
muttering.

"Nothing... 
only 
a 
shell..." 
he 
answered.

"Come 
along, 
our 
Matvevna!" 
he 
said 
to 
himself. 
"Matvevna" 
*
was 
the 
name 
his 
fancy 
gave 
to 
the 
farthest 
gun 
of 
the<p>
battery, 
which
was 
large 
and 
of 
an 
old 
pattern. 
The 
French 
swarming 
round 
their 
guns
seemed 
to 
him 
like 
ants. 
In 
that 
world, 
the 
handsome 
drunkard 
Number 
One
of 
the 
second 
gun's 
crew 
was 
"uncle"; 
Tushin 
looked 
at 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Qb7OfLLj2oFuln5tEu.html">him</a> 
more
often 
than 
at 
anyone 
else 
and 
took 
delight 
in 
his 
every 
movement.
The 
sound 
of 
musketry 
at 
the 
foot 
of 
the 
hill, 
now 
diminishing, 
now
increasing, 
seemed 
like 
someone's 
breathing. 
He 
listened 
intently 
to
the 
ebb 
and 
flow 
of 
these 
sounds.

 
 
 
 
* 
Daughter 
of 
Matthew.

"Ah! 
Breathing 
again, 
breathing!" 
he 
muttered 
to 
himself.

He 
imagined 
himself 
as 
an 
enormously 
tall, 
powerful 
man 
who 
was 
throwing
cannon 
balls 
at 
the 
French 
with 
both 
hands.

"Now 
then, 
Matvevna, 
dear 
old<p>
lady, 
don't 
let 
me 
down!" 
he 
was
saying 
as 
he 
moved 
from 
the 
gun, 
when 
a 
strange, 
unfamiliar 
voice 
called
above 
his 
head: 
"Captain 
Tushin! 
Captain!"

Tushin 
turned 
round 
in 
dismay. 
It 
was 
the 
staff 
officer 
who 
had<p>
turned
him 
out 
of 
the 
booth 
at 
Grunth. 
He 
was 
shouting 
in 
a 
gasping 
voice:

"Are 
you 
mad? 
You 
have 
twice 
been 
ordered 
to 
retreat, 
and 
you..."

"Why 
are 
they 
down 
on 
me?" 
thought 
Tushin, 
looking 
in 
alarm 
at 
his
superior.

"I... 
don't..." 
he 
muttered, 
holding 
up 
two 
fingers 
to 
his 
cap.
"I..."

But 
the 
staff 
officer 
did 
not 
finish 
what 
he 
wanted 
to 
say. 
A 
cannon
ball, 
flying 
close 
to 
him, 
caused 
him 
to 
duck 
and 
bend 
over 
his 
horse.
He 
paused, 
and 
just 
as 
he 
was 
about 
to 
say 
something 
more, 
another 
ball
stopped 
him. 
He 
turned 
his 
horse 
and 
galloped 
off.

"Retire! 
All 
to 
retire!" 
he 
shouted 
from 
a 
distance.

The 
soldiers 
laughed. 
A 
moment 
later, 
an 
adjutant 
arrived 
with 
the 
same
order.

It 
was 
Prince 
Andrew. 
The 
first 
thing 
he 
saw 
on 
riding 
up 
to 
the 
space
where 
Tushin's 
guns 
were 
stationed 
was
