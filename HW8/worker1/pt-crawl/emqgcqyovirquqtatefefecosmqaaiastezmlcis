himself
on 
his 
seat, 
lowered</h1>his 
hands, 
moved 
a 
little 
to 
the 
right 
and 
then 
to
the 
left, 
and 
took 
up 
the 
bottle. 
Anatole 
brought 
two 
candles 
and
placed 
them 
on 
the 
window 
sill, 
though 
it 
was 
already 
quite 
light.
Dolokhov's 
back 
in 
his 
white 
shirt, 
and 
his 
curly 
head, 
were 
lit
up 
from 
both 
sides. 
Everyone 
crowded 
to 
the 
window,<p>
the 
Englishman 
in
front. 
Pierre 
stood 
smiling 
but 
silent. 
One 
man, 
older 
than 
the 
others
present, 
suddenly 
pushed 
forward 
with 
a 
scared 
and 
angry 
look 
and 
wanted
to 
seize 
hold 
of 
Dolokhov's 
shirt.

"I 
say, 
this 
is 
folly! 
He'll 
be 
killed," 
said 
this 
more 
sensible
man.

Anatole 
stopped 
him.

"Don't 
touch 
him! 
You'll 
startle 
him 
and 
then 
he'll 
be 
killed.
Eh?... 
What 
then?... 
Eh?"

Dolokhov 
turned 
round 
and, 
again 
holding 
on 
with 
both 
hands, 
arranged
himself 
on 
his 
seat.

"If 
anyone 
comes 
meddling 
again," 
said 
he, 
emitting 
the 
words
separately 
through 
his 
thin 
compressed 
lips, 
"I 
will 
throw 
him 
down
there. 
Now 
then!"

Saying 
this 
he 
again 
turned 
round, 
dropped 
his 
hands, 
took 
the 
bottle
and 
lifted 
it 
to 
his 
lips, 
threw 
back 
his 
head, 
and 
raised 
his 
free 
hand
to 
balance 
himself. 
One 
of 
the 
footmen 
who 
had 
stooped 
to 
pick 
up 
some
broken 
glass 
remained 
in 
that 
position 
without 
taking 
his 
eyes 
from 
the
window 
and 
from 
Dolokhov's 
back. 
Anatole 
stood 
erect 
with 
staring
eyes. 
The 
Englishman 
looked 
on 
sideways,
