Worldly 
conversation 
at 
a 
moment 
when 
his 
soul 
is
already 
prepared..."

Prince 
Vasili 
was 
seated 
in 
an 
easy 
chair 
in 
his 
familiar 
attitude,
with 
one 
leg 
crossed 
high 
above 
the 
other. 
His 
cheeks, 
which 
were 
so
flabby 
that 
they 
looked 
heavier 
below, 
were 
twitching 
violently; 
but
he 
wore 
the 
air 
of 
a<p>
man 
little 
concerned 
in 
what 
the 
two 
ladies 
were
saying.

"Come, 
my 
dear 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
let 
Catiche 
do 
as 
she 
pleases. 
You
know 
how 
fond 
the 
count 
is 
of 
her."

"I 
don't 
even 
know 
what 
is 
in 
this 
<a href="/cZl/FvO8NFutM3oFcgw6CS.html">paper,"</a> 
said 
the 
younger 
of
the 
two 
ladies, 
addressing 
Prince 
Vasili 
and 
pointing 
to 
an 
inlaid
portfolio 
she 
held 
in 
her 
hand. 
"All 
I 
know 
is 
that 
his 
real 
will 
is
in 
his 
writing 
table, 
and 
this 
is 
a 
paper 
he 
has 
forgotten...."

She 
tried 
to 
pass 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
but 
the 
latter 
sprang 
so 
as 
to 
bar
her 
path.

"I 
know, 
my 
dear, 
kind 
princess," 
said 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
seizing
the 
portfolio 
so 
firmly 
that 
it 
was 
plain 
she 
would 
not 
let 
go 
easily.
"Dear 
princess, 
I 
beg 
and 
implore 
you, 
have 
some 
pity 
on 
him!<p>
Je 
vous
en 
conjure..."

The 
princess 
did 
not 
reply. 
Their 
efforts 
in 
the 
struggle 
for 
the
portfolio 
were 
the 
only 
sounds 
audible, 
but 
it 
was 
evident 
that 
if
the 
princess 
did 
speak, 
her 
words 
would 
not 
be 
flattering 
to 
Anna
Mikhaylovna. 
Though 
the 
latter 
held 
on 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/byy9iOfK5a.html">tenaciously,</a> 
her 
voice 
lost 
none
of 
its 
honeyed 
firmness 
and 
softness.

"Pierre, 
my 
dear, 
come 
here. 
I 
think 
he 
will 
not 
be 
out 
of 
place 
in 
a
family 
consultation; 
is 
it 
not 
so, 
Prince?"

"Why 
don't 
you 
speak, 
cousin?" 
suddenly 
shrieked 
the 
princess 
so
loud 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Lf1KtaDS43CWU.html">that</a> 
those 
in 
the 
drawing 
room 
heard 
her 
and 
were 
startled. 
"Why
do 
you 
remain 
silent 
when 
heaven 
knows 
who 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tE7ieWTn13oC.html">permits</a> 
herself 
to
interfere, 
making 
a 
scene 
on 
the 
very 
threshold 
of 
a 
dying 
man's 
room?
Intriguer!" 
she 
hissed 
viciously, 
and 
tugged 
with 
all 
her 
might 
at 
the
portfolio.

But 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ovD8iLv86kW.html">Anna</a> 
Mikhaylovna 
went 
forward 
a 
step 
or 
two 
to 
keep 
her 
hold 
on 
the
portfolio, 
and 
changed 
her 
grip.

Prince 
Vasili 
rose. 
"Oh!" 
said 
he 
with 
reproach 
and 
surprise,
"this 
is 
absurd! 
Come, 
let 
go 
I 
tell 
you."

The 
princess 
let 
go.

"And 
you 
too!"

But 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
did 
not 
obey 
him.

"Let 
go, 
I 
tell 
you! 
I 
will 
take 
the 
responsibility. 
I 
myself 
will 
go
