innumerable 
instances 
of 
the 
fact
that 
the 
size 
of 
any 
<a href="/cZl/CS7GLq8IDLzm4oOe.html">army</a> 
does 
not

its

that
small 
detachments 
defeat 
larger 
ones, 
obscurely 
admits 
the 
existence
of 
this 
unknown 
factor 
and 
tries 
to 
discover 
it-now 
in 
a 
geometric
formation, 
now 
in 
the 
equipment 
employed, 
now, 
and 
most 
usually, 
in 
the
genius 
of 
the 
commanders. 
But 
the 
assignment 
of 
these 
various 
meanings
to 
the 
factor 
does 
not 
yield 
results 
which 
accord 
with 
the 
historic
facts.

it 
is 
only 
necessary

abandon 
the 
false 
view 
(adopted 
to 
gratify
the 
"heroes") 
of 
the 
efficacy 
of 
the

in

find 
this

quantity.

That 
unknown

is 
the 
spirit 
of 
the 
army, 
that 
is 
to

the
greater

lesser 
readiness

fight 
and 
face 
danger 
felt 
by 
all 
the 
men
composing 
an 
army, 
quite 
independently

whether 
they 
are, 
or 
are 
not,
fighting 
under 
the 
command 
of 
a 
genius,
