there. 
He 
had
gone 
to 
Petersburg, 
but 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
glad 
to 
hear 
this. 
His 
mind
was 
occupied 
by 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
center 
that 
was 
conducting
a 
gigantic 
war, 
and 
he 
was 
glad 
to 
be 
free 
for 
a 
while 
from 
the
distraction 
caused 
by 
the 
thought 
of 
Kuragin. 
During 
the 
<a href="/cZl/IH5S3rP1L.html">first</a> 
four
days, 
while 
no 
duties 
were 
required 
of 
him, 
Prince 
Andrew 
rode 
round 
the
whole 
fortified 
camp 
and, 
by 
the<p>
aid 
of 
his 
own 
knowledge 
and 
by
talks 
with 
experts, 
tried 
to 
form 
a 
definite 
opinion 
about 
it. 
But 
the
question 
whether 
the 
camp 
was 
advantageous 
or 
disadvantageous 
remained
for 
him 
undecided. 
Already 
from 
his 
military 
experience 
and 
what 
he 
had
seen 
in 
the 
Austrian 
campaign, 
he 
had 
come 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
in
war 
the 
most 
deeply 
considered 
plans 
have 
no 
significance 
and 
that 
all
depends 
on 
the 
way 
unexpected 
movements 
of 
the 
enemy-that 
cannot 
be
foreseen-are 
met, 
and 
on 
how 
and 
by 
whom 
the 
whole 
matter 
is 
handled.
To 
clear 
up 
this 
last 
point 
for 
himself, 
Prince 
Andrew, 
utilizing 
his
position 
and 
acquaintances, 
tried 
to 
fathom 
the 
character 
of 
the 
control
of 
the 
army 
and 
of 
the 
men 
and 
parties 
engaged 
in 
it, 
and 
he 
deduced 
for
himself 
the 
following 
of 
the 
state 
of 
affairs.

While 
the 
Emperor 
had 
still 
been 
at 
Vilna, 
the 
forces 
had 
been 
divided
into 
three 
armies. 
First, 
the 
army 
under 
Barclay 
de 
Tolly, 
secondly, 
<a href="/cZl/SNe5NX8bZDWZ7UhXdK.html">the
army</a> 
under 
Bagration,<p>
and 
thirdly, 
the 
one 
commanded 
by 
Tormasov. 
The
Emperor 
was 
with 
the 
first 
army, 
but 
not 
as 
commander 
in 
chief. 
In 
the
orders 
issued 
it 
<a href="/aVzUge/on4s8bOIDr7iGjCy.html">was</a> 
stated, 
not 
that 
the 
Emperor 
would 
take 
command,
but 
only 
that 
he 
would 
be 
with 
the 
army. 
The 
Emperor, 
moreover, 
had
with 
him 
not 
a 
commander 
in 
chief's 
staff 
but 
the 
imperial 
headquarters
staff. 
In 
attendance 
on 
him 
was 
the 
head 
of 
the 
imperial 
staff,
Quartermaster 
General 
Prince 
Volkonski, 
as 
well 
as 
generals, 
imperial
aides-de-camp, 
diplomatic 
officials, 
and 
a 
large 
number 
of<p>
foreigners,
but 
not 
the 
army 
staff. 
Besides 
these, 
there 
were 
in 
attendance 
on 
the
Emperor 
without 
any 
definite 
appointments: 
Arakcheev, 
the 
ex-Minister
of 
War; 
Count 
Bennigsen, 
the 
senior 
general 
in 
rank; 
the 
Grand 
Duke
Tsarevich 
Constantine 
Pavlovich; 
Count 
Rumyantsev, 
the 
Chancellor;
Stein, 
a 
former 
Prussian 
minister; 
Armfeldt, 
a 
Swedish 
general; 
Pfuel,
the 
chief 
author 
of 
the 
plan 
of 
campaign; 
Paulucci, 
an 
adjutant 
general
and 
Sardinian 
emigre; 
Wolzogen-and 
many 
others. 
Though 
these 
men 
had 
no
military 
appointment 
in 
the 
<a href="/cZl/AXs2Z0uFRs2pufMC.html">army,</a> 
their 
position 
gave 
them 
influence,
and 
often 
a 
corps 
commander, 
or 
even 
the 
commander 
in 
chief,
