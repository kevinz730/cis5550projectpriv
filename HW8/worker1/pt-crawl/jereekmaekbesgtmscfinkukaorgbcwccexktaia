because 
it 
seemed 
to</h1>him 
that 
his 
feeling 
for 
her
was 
stronger 
than 
a 
married 
man's 
should 
be 
for 
his 
friend's 
fiancee.
Yet 
some 
fate 
constantly 
threw 
them 
together.

"What 
can 
have 
happened? 
And 
what 
can 
they 
want 
with 
me?" 
thought 
he
as 
he 
dressed 
to 
go 
to 
Marya 
Dmitrievna's. 
"If 
only 
Prince 
Andrew 
would
hurry 
up 
and 
come 
and 
marry 
her!" 
thought 
he 
on 
his 
way 
to 
the 
house.

On 
the 
Tverskoy 
Boulevard 
a 
familiar 
voice 
called 
to 
him.

"Pierre! 
Been 
back 
long?" 
someone 
shouted. 
Pierre 
raised 
his 
head. 
In
a 
sleigh 
drawn 
by 
two 
gray 
trotting-horses 
that 
were 
bespattering 
the
dashboard 
with 
snow, 
Anatole 
and 
his 
constant 
companion 
<a href="/cZl/Cc7O0iPTJ9l.html">Makarin</a> 
dashed
past. 
Anatole 
was 
sitting 
upright 
in 
the 
classic 
pose 
of 
military
dandies, 
the<p>
lower 
part 
of 
his 
face 
hidden 
by 
his 
beaver 
collar 
and 
his
head 
slightly 
bent. 
His 
face 
was 
fresh 
and 
rosy, 
his 
white-plumed 
hat,
tilted 
to 
one 
side, 
disclosed 
his 
curled 
and 
pomaded 
hair 
besprinkled
with 
powdery 
snow.

"Yes, 
indeed, 
that's 
a 
true 
sage," 
thought 
Pierre. 
"He 
sees 
nothing
beyond 
the 
pleasure 
of 
the 
moment, 
nothing 
troubles 
him 
and 
so 
he 
is
always 
cheerful, 
satisfied, 
and 
serene. 
What 
wouldn't 
I 
give 
to 
be 
like
him!" 
he 
thought 
enviously.

In 
Marya 
Dmitrievna's 
anteroom 
the 
footman 
who 
helped 
him 
off 
with 
his
fur 
coat 
said 
that 
the 
mistress 
asked 
him 
to 
come 
to 
her 
bedroom.

When 
he 
opened 
the 
ballroom 
door 
<a href="/aVzUge/nI7CX0J2oqP.html">Pierre</a> 
saw 
Natasha 
sitting 
at 
the
window, 
with 
a 
thin, 
pale, 
and 
spiteful 
face. 
She 
glanced 
round 
at 
him,
frowned, 
and 
left 
the 
room 
with 
an 
expression 
of 
cold 
dignity.

"What 
has 
happened?" 
<a href="/aVzUge/bvO8a7oFuln5wmHLV.html">asked</a> 
Pierre, 
entering 
Marya 
Dmitrievna's 
room.

"Fine 
doings!" 
answered 
Dmitrievna. 
"For 
fifty-eight 
years 
have 
I 
lived
in 
this 
world 
and 
never 
known 
anything 
so 
disgraceful!"

And 
having 
put 
him 
on 
his 
honor 
not 
to 
repeat 
anything 
she 
told 
him,
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
informed 
him<p>
that 
Natasha 
had 
refused 
Prince 
Andrew
without 
her 
parents' 
knowledge 
and 
that 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
was 
Anatole
Kuragin 
into 
whose 
society 
Pierre's 
wife 
had 
thrown 
her 
and 
with 
whom
Natasha 
had 
tried 
to 
elope 
during 
her 
father's 
absence, 
in 
order 
to 
be
married 
secretly.

Pierre 
raised 
his 
shoulders 
and 
listened 
open-mouthed 
to 
what 
was 
told
him, 
scarcely 
able 
to 
believe 
his 
own 
ears. 
That 
Prince 
Andrew's
deeply 
loved 
affianced 
wife-the 
same 
Natasha 
Rostova 
who 
used 
to 
be 
so
charming-should 
give 
up 
Bolkonski 
for 
that 
fool 
Anatole 
who
