boy 
did</h1>not 
remember 
appeared 
to 
him 
a 
divinity 
who 
could 
not
be 
pictured, 
and 
of 
whom 
he 
never 
thought 
without 
a 
swelling 
heart 
and
tears 
of 
sadness 
and 
rapture. 
So 
the 
boy 
also 
was 
happy 
that 
Pierre 
had
arrived.

The 
guests 
welcomed 
Pierre 
because 
he 
always 
helped 
to 
enliven 
and 
unite
any 
company 
he 
was 
in.

The 
grown-up 
members 
of 
the<p>
family, 
not 
to 
mention 
his 
wife, 
were
pleased 
to 
have 
back 
a 
friend 
whose 
presence 
made 
life 
run 
more 
smoothly
and 
peacefully.

The 
old 
ladies 
were 
pleased 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/sw5NSUp68mGGRm.html">with</a> 
the 
presents 
he 
brought 
them, 
and
especially 
that 
Natasha 
would 
now 
be 
herself 
again.

Pierre 
felt 
the 
different 
outlooks 
of 
these 
various 
worlds 
and 
made
haste 
to 
satisfy 
all 
their 
expectations.

Though 
the 
most 
absent-minded<p>
and 
forgetful 
of 
men, 
Pierre, 
with 
the 
aid
of 
a 
list 
his 
wife 
drew 
up, 
had 
now 
bought 
everything, 
not 
forgetting
his 
mother-and 
brother-in-law's 
commissions, 
nor 
the 
dress 
material 
for
a 
present 
to 
Belova, 
nor 
toys 
for 
his 
wife's 
nephews. 
In<p>
the 
early 
days
of 
his 
marriage 
it 
had 
seemed 
strange 
to 
him 
that 
his 
wife 
should 
expect
him 
not 
to 
forget 
to 
procure 
all 
the 
things 
he 
undertook 
to 
buy, 
and 
he
had 
been 
taken 
aback 
by 
her 
serious 
annoyance 
when 
on 
his 
first 
trip 
he
forgot 
everything. 
But 
in 
time 
he 
grew 
used 
to 
this 
demand. 
Knowing 
that
Natasha 
asked 
nothing 
for 
herself, 
and 
gave 
him 
commissions 
for 
others
only 
when 
he 
himself 
had 
offered 
to 
undertake 
them, 
he 
now 
found 
an
unexpected 
and 
childlike 
pleasure 
in 
this 
purchase 
of 
presents 
for
everyone 
in 
the 
house, 
and 
never 
forgot 
anything. 
If 
he 
now 
incurred
Natasha's 
censure 
it 
was 
only 
for 
buying 
too 
many 
and 
too 
expensive
things. 
To 
her 
other 
defects 
(as 
most 
people 
thought 
them, 
but 
which
to 
Pierre 
were 
qualities) 
of 
untidiness 
and 
neglect 
of 
herself, 
she 
now
added 
stinginess.

From 
the 
time 
that 
Pierre 
began 
life 
as 
a 
family 
man 
on 
a 
footing
entailing 
heavy 
expenditure, 
he 
had 
noticed 
to 
his 
surprise 
that 
he
spent 
only 
half 
as 
much 
as 
before, 
and 
that 
his 
affairs-which 
had 
been
in 
disorder 
of 
late, 
chiefly 
because 
of 
his 
first 
wife's 
debts-had 
begun
to 
improve.

Life 
was 
cheaper 
because 
it 
was 
circumscribed: 
that 
<a href="/cZl/Bx1t0Sdo6HQTp.html">most</a> 
expensive
luxury, 
the 
kind 
of 
life 
that 
can 
be 
changed 
at 
any 
moment, 
was 
no
longer 
his 
nor 
did 
he 
wish 
for 
it. 
He 
felt 
that 
his 
way 
of 
life 
had 
now
been 
settled 
once 
for 
all 
till 
death 
and 
that 
to 
change 
it 
was 
not 
in
his 
power, 
and 
so 
that 
way 
of 
life 
proved 
economical.

With 
a 
merry, 
smiling 
face 
Pierre 
was<p>
sorting 
his 
purchases.

"What 
do 
you 
think 
of 
this?" 
said 
he, 
unrolling 
a 
piece 
of 
stuff 
like 
a
shopman.

Natasha,<p>
who 
was 
sitting 
opposite 
to 
him 
with 
her 
eldest 
daughter 
on 
her
lap, 
turned 
her 
sparkling 
eyes 
swiftly 
from 
her 
husband 
to 
the 
things 
he
showed 
her.

"That's 
for 
Belova? 
Excellent!" 
She 
felt 
the<p>
quality 
of 
the 
material.
"It 
was 
a 
ruble 
an 
arshin, 
I 
suppose?"

Pierre 
told 
her 
the 
price.

"Too 
dear!"
