"'From</h1>all 
my 
riding,' 
he 
writes 
to 
the 
Emperor, 
'I 
have 
got 
a
saddle 
sore 
which, 
coming 
after 
all 
my 
<a href="/cZl/SNe5NX8bZDWZ7UhXdK.html">previous</a> 
journeys, 
quite 
prevents
my 
riding<p>
and 
commanding 
so 
vast 
an 
<a href="/aVzUge/fk4C7tA.html">army,</a> 
so 
I 
have 
passed 
on 
the
command 
to 
the 
general 
next 
in 
seniority, 
Count 
Buxhoewden, 
having 
sent
him 
my 
whole 
staff 
and 
all 
that 
belongs 
<a href="/aVzUge/CBh70Wtx0nQqE.html">to</a> 
it, 
advising 
him 
if 
there 
is
a 
lack 
of 
bread, 
to 
<a href="/cZl/AXs2Z0uFRs2pufMC.html">move</a> 
farther 
into 
the 
interior 
of 
Prussia, 
for 
only
one 
day's 
ration 
of 
bread 
remains, 
and 
in 
some 
regiments 
none 
at 
all,
as 
reported 
by 
the 
division 
commanders, 
Ostermann 
and 
Sedmoretzki, 
and
all 
that 
the 
peasants 
had 
has 
been 
eaten 
up. 
I 
myself 
will 
remain 
in
hospital 
at 
Ostrolenka 
till 
I 
recover. 
In 
regard 
to 
which 
I 
humbly
submit 
my 
report, 
with 
the 
information 
that<p>
if 
the 
army 
remains 
in 
its
present 
bivouac 
another 
fortnight 
there 
will 
not

a 
healthy 
man 
left
