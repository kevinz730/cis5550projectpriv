dryly, 
raising 
his 
voice 
to 
the 
pitch
which 
indicates 
that 
patience 
is 
exhausted.

Suddenly 
the 
angry, 
squirrel-like 
expression 
of 
the 
princess' 
pretty
face 
changed 
into 
a 
winning 
and 
piteous 
look 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/cY9Qz1iOfK3yxat.html">of</a> 
fear. 
Her 
beautiful 
eyes
glanced 
askance 
at 
her 
husband's 
face, 
and 
her 
own 
assumed 
the 
timid,
deprecating 
expression 
of 
a 
dog 
when 
it 
rapidly 
but 
feebly 
wags<p>
its
drooping 
tail.

"Mon 
Dieu, 
mon 
Dieu!" 
she 
muttered, 
and 
lifting 
her 
dress 
with 
one
hand 
she 
went 
up 
to 
her 
husband 
and 
kissed 
him 
on 
the 
forehead.

"Good 
night, 
Lise," 
said 
he, 
<a href="/cZl/ha1cU7oqP1H.html">rising</a> 
and 
courteously 
kissing 
her 
hand
as 
he 
would 
have 
done 
to 
a 
stranger.





CHAPTER 
VIII

The 
friends 
were 
<a href="/aVzUge/UVJ5W7hQrxS5Pe.html">silent.</a> 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ef7fLYk28jEXr.html">Neither</a> 
cared 
to 
begin 
talking. 
Pierre
continually 
glanced 
at 
Prince 
Andrew; 
Prince 
Andrew 
rubbed 
his 
forehead
with 
his 
small 
hand.

"Let 
us 
go 
and 
have 
supper," 
he 
said 
with 
a 
sigh, 
going 
to 
the 
door.

They 
entered 
the 
elegant, 
newly 
decorated, 
and 
luxurious 
dining 
room.
Everything 
from 
the 
table 
napkins 
to 
the 
silver, 
china, 
and 
glass 
bore
that 
imprint 
of 
newness 
found 
in 
the 
households 
of 
the 
newly 
married.
Halfway 
through 
supper<p>
Prince 
Andrew 
leaned 
his 
elbows 
on 
the 
table 
and,
with 
a 
look 
of 
nervous 
agitation 
such 
as 
Pierre 
had 
never 
before 
seen 
on
his 
face, 
began 
to 
talk-as 
one 
who 
has 
long 
had 
something 
on 
his 
mind
and 
suddenly 
determines 
to 
speak 
out.

"Never, 
never 
marry, 
my 
dear 
fellow! 
That's 
my 
advice: 
never 
marry
till 
you 
can 
say 
to<p>
yourself 
that 
you 
have 
done 
all 
you 
are 
capable 
of,
and 
until 
you 
have 
ceased 
to 
love 
the 
woman<p>
of 
your 
choice 
and 
have 
seen
her<p>
plainly 
as 
she 
is,<p>
or 
else 
you 
will 
make 
a<p>
cruel 
and 
irrevocable
mistake. 
Marry 
when 
you 
are 
old 
and 
good 
for 
nothing-or 
all 
that 
is
good 
and 
noble 
in 
you 
will 
be 
lost. 
It 
will 
all 
be 
wasted 
on 
trifles.
Yes! 
Yes! 
Yes! 
Don't 
look 
at 
me 
with 
such 
surprise. 
If 
you 
marry
expecting 
anything 
from 
yourself 
in 
the 
future, 
you 
will 
feel 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/uj2jbnI01f.html">at</a> 
every
step 
that 
for 
you 
all 
is 
ended, 
all 
is 
closed 
except 
the 
drawing
room, 
where 
you 
will 
be 
ranged 
side 
by 
side 
with 
a 
court 
lackey 
and 
an
idiot!... 
But 
what's 
the 
good?..." 
and 
he 
waved 
his 
arm.

Pierre 
took 
off 
his 
spectacles, 
which 
made 
his 
face
