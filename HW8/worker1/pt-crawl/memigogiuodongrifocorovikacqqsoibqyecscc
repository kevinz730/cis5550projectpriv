Prince 
Michael 
Ilarionovich! 
(wrote 
the 
Emperor 
on 
the 
second 
of 
October
in 
a 
letter 
that 
reached 
Kutuzov 
after 
the 
battle 
at 
Tarutino) 
Since
September 
2 
Moscow 
has 
been 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
enemy. 
Your 
last 
reports
were 
written 
on 
the 
twentieth, 
and 
during 
all 
this 
time 
not 
only 
has
no 
action 
been 
taken 
against 
the 
enemy 
or 
for 
the 
relief 
of 
the 
ancient
capital, 
but 
according 
to 
your 
last 
report 
you 
have 
even 
retreated
farther. 
Serpukhov 
is 
already 
occupied 
by 
an 
enemy 
detachment 
and 
Tula
with 
its 
famous 
arsenal, 
so 
indispensable 
to 
<a href="/cZl/YR7wjGAw7v9yeL.html">the</a> 
army, 
is 
in 
danger.
From 
General 
Wintzingerode's 
reports, 
I 
see 
that 
an 
enemy 
corps 
of 
ten
thousand 
men 
is 
moving 
on 
the 
Petersburg 
road. 
Another 
corps 
of 
several
thousand 
men 
is 
moving 
on 
Dmitrov. 
A 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vu6WlHf7HBo5cU.html">third</a> 
has 
advanced 
along 
the
Vladimir 
road, 
and 
a 
<a href="/cZl/Lx2eI3.html">fourth,</a> 
rather 
considerable 
detachment 
is 
stationed
between 
Ruza 
and 
Mozhaysk. 
Napoleon 
himself 
was 
in 
Moscow 
as 
late 
as
the 
twenty-fifth. 
In 
view 
of 
all 
this 
information, 
when 
the 
enemy 
has
scattered 
his 
forces 
in 
large 
detachments, 
and 
with 
Napoleon 
and 
his
Guards 
in 
Moscow, 
is 
it 
possible 
that 
the 
enemy's 
forces 
confronting 
you
are 
so 
considerable 
as 
not 
to 
allow 
of 
your 
taking 
the 
offensive? 
On 
the
contrary, 
he 
is 
probably 
pursuing 
you 
with 
detachments, 
or 
at 
most 
with
an 
army 
corps 
much 
weaker 
than 
the 
army 
entrusted 
to 
you. 
It 
would 
seem
that, 
availing 
yourself 
of 
these 
circumstances, 
you 
might 
advantageously
attack 
a 
weaker 
one 
and 
annihilate 
him, 
or 
at 
least 
oblige 
him 
to
retreat, 
retaining 
in 
our 
hands<p>
an 
important 
part 
of 
the 
provinces 
now
occupied 
by 
the 
enemy, 
and 
thereby 
averting 
danger 
from 
Tula 
and 
other
towns 
in 
the 
interior. 
You 
will 
be 
responsible 
if 
the 
enemy 
is 
able 
to
direct 
a 
force 
of 
any 
size 
against 
Petersburg 
to<p>
threaten 
this 
capital
in 
which 
it 
has 
not 
been 
possible 
to 
retain 
many 
troops; 
for 
with 
the
army 
entrusted 
to 
you, 
and 
acting 
with 
resolution 
and 
energy, 
you 
have
ample 
means 
to 
avert 
this 
fresh 
calamity. 
Remember 
that 
you 
have 
still
to 
answer 
to 
our 
offended 
country 
for 
the 
loss 
of 
Moscow. 
You 
have
experienced 
my 
readiness 
to 
reward 
you. 
That 
readiness 
will 
not 
weaken
in 
me, 
but 
I 
and 
Russia 
have 
a 
right 
to 
expect 
from 
you 
all 
the 
zeal,
firmness, 
and 
success 
which 
your 
intellect, 
military 
talent, 
and 
the
courage 
of 
the 
troops 
you 
command 
justify 
us 
in<p>
expecting.


But 
by 
the 
time 
this 
letter, 
which 
proved 
that 
the 
real 
relation 
of
the 
forces 
had 
already 
made 
itself 
felt 
in 
Petersburg, 
was 
dispatched,
Kutuzov 
had 
found 
himself 
unable 
any 
longer 
to 
restrain 
the 
army 
he
commanded 
from 
attacking 
and 
a 
battle 
had 
taken 
place.

On 
the 
second 
of 
October 
a 
Cossack, 
Shapovalov, 
who 
was 
out 
scouting,
killed 
one 
hare 
and 
wounded 
another. 
Following 
the 
wounded 
hare 
he 
made
his 
way 
far 
into 
the 
forest 
and 
came 
upon 
the 
left 
flank 
of 
Murat's
army, 
encamped 
there 
without 
any 
precautions. 
The 
Cossack 
laughingly
told 
his 
comrades 
how 
he 
had 
almost 
fallen 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
French.
A 
cornet, 
hearing 
the 
story, 
informed 
his 
commander.

The 
Cossack 
was 
sent 
for 
and 
questioned. 
The 
Cossack 
officers 
wished
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
this 
chance 
to 
capture 
some 
horses, 
but 
one 
of
the 
superior 
officers, 
who 
was 
acquainted 
with 
the 
higher 
authorities,
reported 
the 
incident 
to 
a 
general 
on 
the 
staff. 
The 
state 
of 
things 
on
the 
staff 
had 
of 
late 
been 
exceedingly 
strained. 
Ermolov 
had 
been 
to
see 
Bennigsen 
a 
few 
days 
previously 
and 
had 
entreated 
him 
to 
use
his 
influence 
with 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
to 
induce 
him 
to 
take
