They

all
dwarfs

woman

Others 
did 
not 
like 
that 
tone 
and 
said 
it 
was 
stupid 
and 
<a href="/cZl/SE5HI7VWVhi6iGjCy.html">vulgar.</a> 
It 
was
said 
that 
Rostopchin 
had 
expelled 
all 
Frenchmen 
and 
even 
all 
foreigners
from 
Moscow, 
and 
that 
there 
had 
<a href="/aVzUge/YE7mbEd9f4tHLaX.html">been</a> 
some 
spies 
and 
agents 
of 
Napoleon
among 
them; 
but 
this 
was 
told 
chiefly 
to 
introduce 
Rostopchin's 
witty
remark 
on 
that 
occasion. 
The 
foreigners 
were 
deported 
to 
Nizhni 
by
boat, 
and 
Rostopchin 
had 
said 
to 
them 
in 
French: 
"Rentrez 
en 
vous-memes;
entrez 
dans 
la 
barque, 
et 
n'en 
faites 
pas 
une<p>
barque 
de 
Charon."

There
was 
talk 
of 
all 
the 
government 
offices 
having 
been 
<a href="/cZl/FvO6hai1bvg.html">already</a> 
removed 
from
Moscow, 
and 
to 
this 
Shinshin's 
witticism 
was 
added-that 
for 
that 
alone
Moscow 
ought 
to 
be 
grateful 
to 
Napoleon. 
It 
was 
said 
that 
Mamonov's
regiment 
would 
cost 
him 
eight 
hundred 
thousand 
rubles, 
and 
that 
Bezukhov
had 
spent 
even 
more 
on 
his, 
but 
that 
the 
best 
thing 
about 
Bezukhov's
action 
was 
that 
he 
himself 
was 
going 
to 
don 
a 
uniform 
and 
ride 
at 
the
head 
of 
his 
regiment 
without 
charging 
anything 
for 
the 
show.
