is 
over, 
"and 
the 
count's</h1>papers 
are 
opened,
the 
will 
and 
letter 
will 
be 
delivered 
to 
the 
Emperor, 
and 
the 
petition
will 
certainly 
be 
granted. 
Pierre 
will 
get 
everything 
as 
the 
legitimate
son."

"And 
our 
share?" 
asked 
the 
princess 
smiling 
ironically, 
as 
if
anything 
might<p>
happen, 
only 
not 
that.

"But, 
my 
poor 
Catiche, 
it 
is 
as 
clear 
as 
daylight! 
He 
will 
then 
be 
the
legal 
heir 
to 
everything 
and 
you 
won't 
get 
anything. 
You 
must 
know,
my 
dear, 
whether 
the 
will 
and 
letter 
were 
written, 
and 
whether 
they 
have
been 
destroyed 
or 
not. 
And 
if 
they 
have 
somehow 
<a href="/aVzUge/zJ4UDh7Nz3s.html">been</a> 
overlooked, 
you
ought 
to 
know 
where 
they 
are, 
and 
must 
find 
them, 
because..."

"What 
next?" 
the 
princess 
interrupted, 
smiling 
sardonically 
and 
not
changing 
the 
expression 
of 
her 
eyes. 
"I 
am 
a 
woman, 
and 
you 
think 
we
are 
all 
stupid; 
but 
I 
know 
this: 
an 
illegitimate 
son 
cannot 
inherit...
un 
batard!"* 
she 
added, 
as 
if 
supposing 
that 
this 
translation 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rz63KSVyY0ws.html">the
word</a> 
would 
effectively 
prove 
to 
Prince 
Vasili 
the 
invalidity 
of 
his
contention.

 
 
 
 
 
* 
A 
bastard.

"Well, 
really, 
Catiche! 
Can't 
you 
understand! 
You 
are 
so
intelligent, 
how 
is 
it 
you 
don't 
see 
that 
if 
the 
count 
has 
written 
a
letter 
to 
the 
Emperor 
begging 
him 
to 
recognize 
Pierre 
as 
legitimate, 
it
follows 
that 
Pierre 
will 
not 
be 
Pierre 
but 
will 
become 
Count 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ow92Npkec1tA.html">Bezukhov,
and</a> 
will 
then 
inherit 
everything 
under 
the 
will? 
And 
if 
the 
will 
and
letter 
are 
not 
destroyed, 
then 
you 
will 
have 
nothing 
but 
the 
consolation
of 
having 
been 
dutiful 
et 
tout 
ce 
qui 
s'ensuit!* 
That's 
certain."

 
 
 
 
 
* 
And 
all 
that 
follows 
therefrom.

"I 
know 
the 
will 
was 
made, 
but 
I 
also 
know 
that 
it 
is 
invalid;
and 
you, 
mon 
cousin, 
seem 
to 
consider 
me 
a 
perfect 
fool," 
said 
the
princess 
with 
the 
expression 
women 
assume 
when 
they 
suppose 
they 
are
saying 
something 
witty<p>
and 
stinging.

"My 
dear 
Princess 
Catherine 
Semenovna," 
began 
Prince 
Vasili
impatiently, 
"I 
came 
here 
not 
to 
wrangle 
with 
you, 
but 
to 
talk 
about
your 
interests 
as 
with 
a 
kinswoman, 
a 
good, 
kind, 
true 
relation. 
And 
I
tell 
you 
for 
the 
tenth 
time 
that 
if 
the 
letter 
to 
the 
Emperor 
and 
the
will 
in 
Pierre's 
favor 
are 
among 
the<p>
count's 
papers, 
then, 
my 
dear
girl, 
you 
and 
your 
sisters 
are 
not 
heiresses! 
If 
you 
don't 
believe 
me,
then 
believe 
an 
expert. 
I 
have 
just 
been 
talking 
to 
Dmitri 
Onufrich"
(the 
family 
solicitor) 
"and 
he 
says 
the 
same."

At 
this 
a 
sudden 
change 
evidently 
took 
place 
in 
the 
princess' 
ideas;
her 
thin 
lips 
grew 
white, 
though 
her 
eyes 
did 
not 
change, 
and 
her 
voice
when 
she 
began 
to 
speak 
passed 
through 
such 
transitions 
as 
she 
herself
evidently 
did 
not 
expect.

"That 
would 
be 
a 
fine 
thing!" 
said<p>
she. 
"I<p>
never 
wanted 
anything
and 
I 
don't 
now."

She 
pushed 
the 
little 
dog 
off 
her 
lap 
and 
smoothed 
her 
dress.

"And 
this 
is 
gratitude-this 
is 
recognition 
for 
those 
who 
have
sacrificed 
everything 
for 
his 
sake!" 
she 
cried. 
"It's 
splendid!
Fine! 
I 
don't 
want 
anything, 
Prince."

"Yes, 
but 
you 
are 
not 
the 
only 
one. 
There 
are 
your 
sisters..."
replied 
Prince 
Vasili.

But 
the 
princess 
did 
not 
listen 
to 
him.

"Yes, 
I 
knew 
it 
long 
ago 
but 
had 
forgotten. 
I 
knew 
that 
I 
could 
expect
nothing 
but 
meanness, 
deceit, 
envy, 
intrigue, 
and 
ingratitude-the
blackest
