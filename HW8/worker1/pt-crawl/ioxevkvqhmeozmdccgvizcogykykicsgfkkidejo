of 
horses 
and 
a 
sportsman,
he 
had 
lately 
procured 
himself 
a 
large, 
fine, 
mettlesome, 
Donets 
horse,
dun-colored, 
with 
light 
mane 
and 
tail, 
and 
when 
he 
rode 
it 
no 
one 
could
outgallop 
him. 
To 
ride 
this 
horse 
was 
a 
pleasure 
to 
him, 
and 
he 
thought
of 
the 
horse, 
of 
the 
morning, 
of 
the 
doctor's 
wife, 
but 
not 
once 
of 
the
impending 
danger.

Formerly, 
when 
going 
into 
action, 
Rostov 
had 
felt 
afraid; 
now 
he 
had
not 
the 
least 
feeling 
of 
fear. 
He 
was 
fearless, 
not 
because 
he 
had 
grown
used 
to 
being 
under 
fire 
(one 
cannot 
grow 
used 
to 
danger), 
but 
because
he 
had 
learned 
how 
to 
manage 
his 
thoughts 
when 
in 
danger. 
He 
had 
grown
accustomed 
when 
going 
into 
action 
to 
think 
about 
anything 
but 
what 
would
seem 
most 
likely 
to 
interest 
him-the 
impending 
danger. 
During 
the
first 
period 
of 
his 
service, 
hard 
as 
he 
tried 
and 
much 
as 
he 
reproached
himself 
with 
cowardice, 
he 
had 
not 
been 
able 
to 
do 
this, 
but 
with 
time
it 
had 
come 
of<p>
itself. 
Now 
he 
rode 
beside 
Ilyin 
under 
the 
birch 
trees,
occasionally 
plucking 
leaves 
from 
a 
branch 
that 
met 
his 
hand, 
sometimes
touching 
his 
horse's 
side 
with 
his 
foot, 
or, 
without 
turning 
round,
handing 
a 
pipe 
he 
had 
finished 
to 
an 
hussar 
riding 
behind 
him, 
with 
as
calm 
and 
careless 
an 
air 
as 
though 
he 
were 
merely 
out 
for 
a 
ride. 
He
glanced 
with 
pity 
at 
the 
excited 
face 
of 
Ilyin, 
who 
talked 
much 
and 
in
great 
agitation. 
He 
knew 
from 
experience 
the 
tormenting 
expectation 
of
terror 
and 
death 
the 
cornet 
was 
suffering 
and 
knew 
that 
only 
time 
could
help 
him.

As 
soon 
as 
the 
sun 
appeared 
in 
a 
clear 
strip 
of 
sky 
beneath 
the 
clouds,
the 
wind 
fell, 
as 
if 
it 
dared 
not 
spoil 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
summer 
morning
after 
<a href="/cZl/qj9eXK5ZNkA6pXQvm.html">the</a> 
storm; 
drops 
still 
continued 
to 
fall, 
but 
vertically 
now, 
and
all 
was 
still. 
The 
whole 
sun 
appeared 
on 
the 
horizon 
and 
disappeared
behind 
a 
long 
narrow 
cloud 
that 
hung 
above 
it. 
A 
few 
minutes 
later 
it
reappeared 
brighter 
still 
from 
behind 
the 
top 
of 
the 
cloud, 
tearing 
its
edge. 
Everything 
grew 
bright 
and 
glittered. 
And 
with 
that 
light, 
and 
as
if 
in 
reply 
to 
it, 
came 
the 
sound 
of 
guns 
ahead 
of 
them.

Before 
Rostov 
had 
had 
time 
to 
consider<p>
and 
determine 
the 
distance 
of
that 
firing, 
Count 
Ostermann-Tolstoy's 
adjutant 
came 
galloping<p>
from
Vitebsk 
with 
orders 
to 
advance 
at 
a 
trot 
along 
the 
road.

The 
squadron 
overtook 
and 
passed 
the 
infantry 
and 
the 
battery-which 
had
also 
quickened 
their 
pace-rode 
down 
a 
hill, 
and 
passing 
through 
an 
empty
and 
deserted 
village 
again 
ascended. 
The 
horses 
began 
to 
lather 
and 
the
men 
to 
flush.

"Halt! 
Dress<p>
your 
ranks!" 
the 
order<p>
of 
the 
regimental 
commander 
was
heard 
ahead. 
"Forward 
by 
the 
left. 
Walk, 
march!" 
came 
the 
order 
from 
in
front.

And 
the 
hussars, 
passing 
along 
the 
line 
of 
troops 
on 
the 
left 
flank 
of
our 
position, 
halted 
behind 
our<p>
Uhlans 
who 
were 
in 
the 
front 
line. 
To
the 
right 
stood 
our 
infantry 
in 
a 
dense 
column: 
they 
were 
the 
reserve.
Higher 
up 
the 
hill, 
on 
the 
very 
horizon, 
our 
guns 
were 
visible 
through
the 
wonderfully 
clear 
air, 
brightly 
illuminated 
by 
slanting 
morning
sunbeams. 
In 
front, 
beyond 
a 
hollow 
dale, 
could 
be 
seen 
the 
enemy's
columns 
and 
guns. 
Our 
advanced 
line,
