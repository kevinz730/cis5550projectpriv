He</h1>is
very 
clever<p>
but 
eccentric, 
and 
a 
bore. 
The 
poor 
girl 
is 
very 
unhappy.
She 
has 
a 
brother; 
I 
think 
you 
know 
him, 
he 
married 
Lise 
Meinen 
lately.
He 
is 
an 
aide-de-camp 
of 
Kutuzov's 
and 
will 
be 
here 
tonight."

"Listen, 
dear 
Annette," 
said 
the 
prince, 
suddenly 
taking 
<a href="/aVzUge/SvD6UQ4ReoD7Y.html">Anna
Pavlovna's</a> 
hand 
and 
for 
some 
reason 
drawing 
it 
downwards. 
"Arrange
that 
affair 
for 
me 
and 
I 
shall 
always 
be 
your 
most 
devoted 
slave-slafe
with 
an 
f, 
as 
a 
village 
elder 
of 
mine 
writes 
in 
his 
reports. 
She 
is 
rich
and 
of 
good 
family 
and 
that's 
all 
I 
want."

And 
with 
the 
familiarity 
and 
easy 
grace 
peculiar 
to 
him, 
he 
raised 
the
maid 
of 
honor's 
hand 
to 
his 
lips, 
kissed 
it, 
and 
swung 
it 
to 
and 
fro
as 
he 
lay 
back 
in 
his 
armchair, 
looking 
in 
another 
direction.

"Attendez," 
said 
Anna 
Pavlovna, 
reflecting, 
"I'll 
speak 
to
Lise, 
young 
Bolkonski's 
wife, 
this 
very 
evening, 
and 
perhaps 
the
thing 
can 
be 
arranged. 
It 
shall 
be<p>
on 
your 
family's 
behalf 
that 
I'll
start 
my 
apprenticeship 
as 
old 
maid."





CHAPTER 
II

Anna 
Pavlovna's 
drawing 
room 
was 
gradually 
filling. 
The 
highest
Petersburg 
society 
was 
<a href="/cZl/PK5ZUI0EXJo9ON.html">assembled</a> 
there: 
people 
differing 
widely 
in 
age
and 
character 
but 
alike 
in 
the 
social 
circle 
to 
which 
they 
belonged.
Prince 
Vasili's 
daughter, 
the 
beautiful 
Helene,<p>
came 
to 
take 
her
father 
to 
the 
ambassador's 
entertainment; 
she 
wore 
a 
ball 
dress<p>
and
her 
badge 
as 
maid 
of 
honor. 
The 
youthful 
little 
Princess 
Bolkonskaya,
known 
as 
la 
femme 
la 
plus 
seduisante 
de 
Petersbourg, 
* 
was 
also 
there.
She 
had 
been 
married 
during 
the 
previous 
winter, 
and 
being 
pregnant 
did
not<p>
go 
to 
any 
large 
gatherings, 
but 
only 
to 
small 
receptions. 
Prince
Vasili's 
son, 
Hippolyte, 
had 
come 
with 
Mortemart, 
whom 
he 
introduced.
The 
Abbe 
Morio 
and 
many 
others 
had 
also 
come.

 
 
 
 
 
* 
The 
most 
fascinating 
woman 
in 
Petersburg.

To 
each 
new 
arrival 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
said, 
"You 
have 
not 
yet 
seen 
my
aunt," 
or 
"You 
do 
not<p>
know 
my 
aunt?" 
and 
very 
gravely 
conducted
him 
or 
her 
to 
a 
little 
old 
lady, 
wearing 
large 
bows 
of 
ribbon 
in 
her
cap, 
who 
had 
come 
sailing 
in 
from 
another 
room 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
guests
began 
to 
arrive; 
and 
slowly 
turning 
her 
eyes 
from 
the 
visitor 
to 
her
aunt, 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
mentioned 
each 
one's 
name 
and 
then 
left 
them.

Each 
visitor 
performed 
the 
ceremony 
of 
greeting 
this 
old 
aunt 
whom 
not
one 
of 
them 
knew, 
not 
one 
of 
them 
wanted 
to 
know, 
and 
not 
one 
of 
them
cared 
about; 
Anna 
<a href="/aVzUge/WC6zmeD7cYy0.html">Pavlovna</a> 
observed 
these 
greetings 
with 
mournful 
and
solemn 
interest 
and 
silent 
approval. 
The 
aunt 
spoke 
to 
each 
of 
them 
in
the 
same 
words, 
about 
their 
health 
and 
her 
own, 
and 
the 
health 
of 
Her
Majesty, 
"who, 
thank 
God, 
was 
better 
today." 
And 
each 
visitor,
though 
politeness 
prevented 
his 
showing 
impatience, 
left 
the 
old 
woman
with 
a<p>
sense 
of 
relief 
at 
having 
performed 
a 
vexatious 
duty 
and 
did 
not
return 
to 
her 
the 
whole 
evening.

The 
young 
Princess 
Bolkonskaya 
had 
brought 
some 
work 
in 
a
gold-embroidered 
velvet 
bag. 
Her 
pretty 
little 
upper 
lip, 
on 
which 
a
delicate 
dark 
down 
was 
just 
perceptible, 
was 
too 
short 
for 
her 
teeth,
but 
it 
lifted 
all 
the 
more 
sweetly, 
and 
was 
especially 
charming 
when 
she
occasionally<p>
drew 
it 
down 
to 
meet 
the 
lower 
lip. 
As 
is 
always 
the 
case
with 
a 
thoroughly 
attractive 
woman, 
her 
defect-the 
shortness 
of 
her
upper 
lip 
and 
her 
half-open 
mouth-seemed 
to 
be 
her 
own 
special
