"I</h1>am 
going 
away."

"Where 
to?"

"To 
the 
army."

"But 
you 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vh18c7.html">meant</a> 
to 
stay 
another 
two 
days?"

"But 
now 
I 
am 
off 
at 
once."

And 
Prince<p>
Andrew 
after 
giving 
directions 
about 
his 
departure 
went 
to
his 
room.

"Do<p>
you 
know, 
mon 
cher," 
said 
Bilibin 
following 
him, 
"I 
have 
been
thinking 
about 
you. 
Why 
are 
you 
going?"

And 
in 
proof 
of 
the 
conclusiveness 
of 
his 
opinion 
all 
the 
wrinkles
vanished 
from 
his 
face.

Prince 
Andrew 
looked 
inquiringly 
at 
him 
and 
gave 
no 
reply.

"Why 
are 
you 
going? 
I 
know 
you 
think 
it 
your 
duty 
to 
gallop 
back 
to
the 
army 
now 
that 
it 
is 
in 
danger. 
I 
understand 
that. 
Mon 
cher, 
it 
is
heroism!"

"Not 
at 
all," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew.

"But 
as 
you 
are 
a 
philosopher, 
be 
a 
consistent 
one, 
look 
at 
the 
other
side 
of 
the 
question 
and 
you 
will 
see 
that 
your 
duty, 
on 
the 
contrary,
is 
to 
take 
care 
of 
yourself. 
Leave 
it 
to 
those 
who 
are 
no<p>
longer 
fit 
for
anything 
else.... 
You 
have 
not 
been 
ordered 
to 
return 
and 
have 
not 
been
dismissed 
from 
here; 
therefore, 
you 
can 
stay 
and 
go 
with 
us 
wherever 
our
ill 
luck 
takes 
us. 
They 
say 
we 
are 
going 
to 
Olmuetz, 
and 
Olmuetz 
is 
a
very 
decent 
town. 
You 
and 
I 
will 
travel 
comfortably 
in 
my 
caleche."

"Do 
stop 
joking, 
Bilibin," 
cried 
Bolkonski.

"I 
am 
speaking 
sincerely 
as 
a 
friend! 
Consider! 
Where 
and 
why 
are
you 
going, 
when 
you 
might 
remain 
here? 
You 
are 
faced 
by 
one 
of 
two
things," 
and 
the 
skin 
over 
his 
left 
temple 
puckered,<p>
"either 
you
will 
not 
reach 
your 
regiment 
before 
peace 
is 
concluded, 
or 
you 
will
share 
defeat 
and 
disgrace 
with 
Kutuzov's 
whole<p>
army."

And 
Bilibin 
unwrinkled 
his 
temple, 
feeling 
that 
the<p>
dilemma 
was
insoluble.

"I 
cannot 
argue 
about 
it," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew 
coldly, 
but 
he
thought: 
"I 
am 
going 
to 
save 
the 
army."

"My 
dear 
fellow, 
you 
are 
a 
hero!" 
said 
Bilibin.





CHAPTER 
XIII

That 
same 
night, 
having 
taken 
leave 
of 
the 
Minister 
of 
War, 
Bolkonski
set 
off 
to 
rejoin 
the 
army, 
not 
knowing 
where 
he 
would 
find 
it<p>
and
fearing 
to 
be 
captured 
by 
the 
French 
on 
the 
way 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Vd4GdRBS0DduKC9cLqy.html">to</a> 
Krems.

In 
Bruenn 
everybody 
attached 
to 
the 
court 
was 
packing 
up, 
and 
the 
heavy
baggage 
was 
already 
being 
dispatched 
to 
Olmuetz. 
Near 
Hetzelsdorf 
Prince
Andrew 
struck 
the 
high 
road 
along 
which 
the 
Russian 
army 
was 
moving 
with
great 
haste 
and 
in 
the 
greatest 
disorder. 
The 
road 
was 
so 
obstructed
with 
carts 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
get 
by 
in 
a 
carriage. 
Prince 
Andrew
took 
a 
horse 
and 
a 
Cossack 
from 
a 
Cossack<p>
commander, 
and 
hungry 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Uc7hOZs5W6Mm.html">and
weary,</a> 
making 
his 
way 
past 
the 
baggage 
wagons, 
rode 
in 
search 
of 
the
commander 
in 
chief 
and 
of 
his 
own 
luggage. 
Very 
sinister<p>
reports 
of 
the
position<p>
of 
the 
army 
reached 
him 
as 
he 
went 
along, 
and 
the 
appearance 
of
the 
troops 
in 
their 
disorderly 
flight 
confirmed 
these 
rumors.

"Cette 
armee 
russe 
que 
l'or 
de 
l'Angleterre 
a 
transportee 
des
extremites 
de 
l'univers, 
nous 
allons 
lui 
faire 
eprouver 
le 
meme
sort-(le 
sort 
de 
l'armee 
d'Ulm)."
