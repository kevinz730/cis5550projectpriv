<a href="/cZl/qi6zvJ6ej1tsa.html">a</a></h1>scar 
on 
his 
cheek-"and 
this 
leg 
which 
as
you 
see 
does 
not 
want 
to 
march, 
I 
got 
that 
on 
the 
seventh 
at 
the 
great
battle 
of 
la 
Moskowa. 
Sacre 
Dieu! 
It 
was 
splendid! 
That 
deluge 
of 
fire
was 
worth 
seeing. 
It 
was 
a 
tough 
job 
you 
set 
us 
there, 
my 
word! 
You 
may
be 
proud 
of 
it! 
And 
on 
my 
honor, 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
cough 
I 
caught 
there, 
I
should 
be 
ready 
to 
begin 
again. 
I 
pity 
those 
who 
did 
not 
see 
it."

"I 
was 
there," 
said 
Pierre.

"Bah, 
really? 
So 
much 
the 
better! 
You 
are 
certainly 
brave 
foes. 
The
great 
redoubt 
held 
out 
well, 
by 
my 
pipe!" 
continued 
the 
Frenchman. 
"And
you 
made 
us 
pay 
dear 
for 
it. 
I 
was 
at 
it 
three 
times-sure 
as 
I 
sit 
here.
Three 
times 
we 
reached 
the 
guns 
and 
three 
times 
we 
were 
thrown 
back
like 
cardboard 
figures. 
Oh, 
it 
was 
beautiful, 
Monsieur 
Pierre! 
Your
grenadiers 
were 
splendid, 
by 
heaven! 
I 
saw 
them 
close 
up 
their 
ranks 
six
times 
in 
succession 
and 
march 
as 
if 
on 
parade. 
Fine 
fellows! 
Our 
King 
of
Naples, 
who 
knows 
what's 
what, 
cried 
'Bravo!' 
Ha, 
ha! 
So 
you 
are 
one 
of
us 
soldiers!" 
he 
added, 
smiling, 
after 
a 
momentary 
pause. 
"So 
much
the 
better, 
so 
much 
the 
better, 
Monsieur 
Pierre!<p>
Terrible 
in 
battle...
gallant... 
with 
the 
fair" 
(he 
winked 
and 
smiled), 
"that's 
what 
the
French 
are, 
Monsieur 
Pierre, 
aren't 
they?"

The 
captain 
was 
so 
naively 
and 
good-humoredly 
gay, 
so 
real, 
and 
so
pleased 
with 
himself 
that 
Pierre 
almost 
winked 
back 
as 
he 
looked 
merrily
at 
him. 
Probably 
the 
word 
"gallant" 
turned 
the 
captain's 
thoughts<p>
to 
the
state 
of 
Moscow.

"Apropos, 
tell 
me 
please, 
is 
it 
true 
that 
the 
women 
have 
all 
left
Moscow? 
What 
a 
queer 
idea! 
What 
had 
they 
to 
be 
afraid 
of?"

"Would 
not 
the 
French 
<a href="/cZl/UDh6AF00.html">ladies</a> 
leave 
Paris 
if 
the 
Russians 
entered 
it?"
asked 
Pierre.

"Ha, 
ha, 
ha!" 
The 
Frenchman 
emitted 
a 
merry, 
sanguine 
chuckle, 
patting
Pierre 
on 
the 
shoulder. 
"What 
a 
thing 
to 
say!" 
he 
exclaimed. 
"Paris?...
But 
Paris, 
Paris..."

"Paris-the 
capital 
of 
the 
world," 
Pierre 
finished 
his 
remark 
for 
him.

The 
captain 
looked 
at 
Pierre. 
He 
had 
a 
habit 
of 
stopping 
short 
in 
the
middle 
of 
his 
talk 
and 
gazing 
intently 
with 
his 
laughing, 
kindly 
eyes.

"Well, 
if 
you 
hadn't 
told 
me 
you 
were 
Russian, 
I 
should 
have 
wagered
that 
you 
were 
Parisian! 
You 
have 
that... 
I 
don't 
know 
what, 
that..." 
and
having 
uttered 
this 
compliment, 
he 
again 
gazed 
at 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cm8wNlRn9CpNdk5.html">him</a> 
in 
silence.

"I 
have 
been 
in 
Paris. 
I 
spent 
years 
there," 
said 
Pierre.

"Oh 
yes, 
one 
sees 
that 
plainly. 
Paris!... 
A 
man 
who 
doesn't 
know 
Paris
is 
a 
savage. 
You 
can 
tell 
a 
Parisian 
two 
leagues 
off. 
Paris 
is 
Talma, 
la
Duchenois, 
Potier, 
the 
Sorbonne, 
the 
boulevards," 
and 
noticing 
that
his 
conclusion 
was 
weaker 
than 
what 
had 
gone 
before, 
he 
added<p>
quickly:
"There 
is 
only 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jT2bI3yxat5tLBOA.html">one</a> 
Paris 
in 
the 
world. 
You 
have 
been 
to 
Paris 
and 
have
remained 
Russian. 
Well, 
I 
don't 
esteem 
you 
the 
less 
for 
it."

Under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
wine 
he 
had 
drunk, 
and 
after 
the 
days 
he 
had
spent 
alone 
with 
his 
depressing 
thoughts, 
Pierre 
involuntarily 
enjoyed
talking 
with 
this 
cheerful 
and 
good-natured 
man.

"To 
return 
to 
your 
ladies-I 
hear 
they 
are 
lovely. 
What 
a 
wretched 
idea
to 
go 
and 
bury 
themselves 
in 
the 
steppes 
when 
the 
French 
army 
is 
in
Moscow. 
What 
a 
chance 
those 
girls 
have 
missed! 
Your 
peasants, 
now-that's
another 
thing; 
but 
you<p>
civilized 
people, 
you 
ought 
to 
know 
us 
better
than 
that. 
We 
took 
Vienna, 
Berlin, 
Madrid, 
Naples, 
Rome, 
Warsaw, 
all
the 
world's 
capitals.... 
We 
are 
feared, 
but 
we 
are 
loved. 
We 
are 
nice 
to
know. 
And 
then 
the 
Emperor..." 
he 
began, 
but 
Pierre 
interrupted 
him.

"The 
Emperor," 
Pierre 
repeated, 
and 
his 
face 
suddenly 
became 
<a href="/aVzUge/vPq1fvg.html">sad</a> 
and
embarrassed, 
"is 
the 
Emperor...?"

"The 
Emperor? 
He 
is 
generosity, 
mercy,
