now 
said 
with 
a
prophet's 
pride.</h1>"I 
always 
said 
he 
was 
the 
only 
man 
capable 
of 
defeating
Napoleon."

But 
next 
day 
no 
news 
arrived 
from 
the 
army 
and 
the 
public 
mood 
grew
anxious. 
The 
courtiers 
suffered 
because 
of 
the 
suffering 
the 
suspense
occasioned 
the 
Emperor.

"Fancy 
the 
Emperor's 
position!" 
said 
they, 
and 
instead 
of 
extolling
Kutuzov 
as 
they 
had 
done 
the 
day 
before, 
they 
condemned 
him 
as 
the 
cause
of 
the 
Emperor's 
anxiety. 
That 
day 
Prince 
Vasili 
no 
longer 
boasted 
of
his 
protege 
Kutuzov, 
but 
remained 
silent 
when 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
was
mentioned. 
Moreover, 
toward 
evening, 
as 
if 
everything 
conspired 
to 
make
Petersburg 
society 
anxious 
and 
uneasy, 
a 
terrible 
piece 
of 
news 
was
added. 
Countess 
Helene 
Bezukhova 
had 
suddenly 
died 
of 
that 
terrible
malady 
<a href="/aVzUge/EM33CT3Fv.html">it</a> 
had 
been 
so 
agreeable 
to 
mention. 
Officially, 
at 
large
gatherings, 
everyone 
said 
that 
Countess 
Bezukhova 
had 
died 
of 
a
terrible 
attack 
of 
angina 
pectoris, 
but 
in 
intimate 
circles 
details
were 
mentioned 
of 
how 
the 
private 
physician 
of 
the 
Queen 
of 
Spain 
had
prescribed 
small 
doses 
of 
a 
certain 
drug 
to 
produce 
a 
certain 
effect;
but 
Helene, 
tortured 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
old 
count 
suspected 
her 
and
that 
her<p>
husband 
to 
whom 
she 
had 
written 
(that 
wretched, 
profligate
Pierre) 
had 
not 
replied, 
had 
suddenly 
taken 
a 
very 
large 
dose 
of 
the
drug, 
and 
had 
died 
in 
agony 
before 
assistance 
could 
be 
rendered 
her.
It 
was 
said 
that 
Prince 
Vasili 
and 
the 
old 
count 
had 
turned 
upon 
the
Italian, 
but 
the 
latter 
had 
produced 
such 
letters 
from 
the 
unfortunate
deceased 
that 
they 
had 
immediately 
let 
the 
matter 
drop.

Talk 
in 
general 
centered 
round 
three 
melancholy 
facts: 
the 
Emperor's
lack 
of 
news, 
the 
loss 
of 
Kutaysov, 
and 
the 
death 
of 
Helene.

On 
the 
third 
day 
after 
Kutuzov's 
report 
a 
country 
gentleman 
arrived 
from
Moscow, 
and 
news 
of 
the 
surrender 
of 
Moscow 
to 
the 
French 
spread 
through
the 
whole 
town. 
This 
was 
terrible! 
What 
a 
position 
for 
the 
Emperor 
to
be 
in! 
Kutuzov 
was 
a 
traitor, 
and 
Prince 
Vasili 
during 
the 
visits 
of
condolence 
paid 
to 
him 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
his 
daughter's 
death 
said 
of
Kutuzov, 
whom 
he 
had 
formerly 
praised 
(it 
was 
excusable 
for 
him 
in 
his
grief 
to 
forget 
what 
he 
had 
said), 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
expect
anything 
else 
from 
a 
blind 
and 
depraved 
old 
man.

"I 
only 
wonder 
that 
the 
fate 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oUZ59J1bI.html">Russia</a> 
could 
have 
been 
entrusted 
to 
such
a 
man."

As 
long 
as 
this 
news 
remained 
unofficial 
it 
was 
possible<p>
to 
doubt 
it,
but 
the 
next 
day 
the 
following 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tHL2iU9hxx7.html">communication</a> 
was 
received 
from 
Count
Rostopchin:

Prince 
Kutuzov's 
adjutant 
has 
brought 
me 
a 
letter 
in 
which 
he 
demands
police 
officers 
<a href="/aVzUge/td26W1kQqNG.html">to</a> 
guide 
the 
army 
to 
the 
Ryazan 
road. 
He<p>
writes 
that
he 
is 
regretfully 
abandoning 
Moscow. 
Sire! 
Kutuzov's 
action 
decides 
the
fate 
of 
the 
capital 
and 
of 
your 
empire! 
Russia 
will 
shudder 
to 
learn 
of
the 
abandonment 
of 
the 
city 
in 
which 
her 
greatness 
is 
centered 
and 
in
which 
lie 
the 
ashes 
of 
your 
ancestors! 
I 
shall 
follow 
the 
army. 
I 
have
had 
everything 
removed, 
and 
it 
only 
remains 
for 
me 
to 
weep 
over 
the 
fate
of 
my 
fatherland.

On 
receiving 
this 
dispatch 
the 
Emperor 
sent 
Prince 
Volkonski 
to 
Kutuzov
with 
the 
following 
rescript:

Prince 
Michael 
Ilarionovich! 
<a href="/aVzUge/Gt5baib1We0sfA.html">Since</a> 
the 
twenty-ninth 
of 
August 
I 
have
received 
no 
communication 
from 
you, 
yet 
on 
the 
first 
of 
September 
I
received 
from 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
of 
Moscow, 
via 
Yaroslavl, 
the 
sad
news 
that 
you, 
with 
the 
army, 
have 
decided 
to 
abandon 
Moscow. 
You 
can
yourself 
imagine 
the 
effect 
this 
news 
has 
had 
on 
me, 
and 
your 
silence
increases 
my 
astonishment. 
I 
am 
sending 
this 
by 
Adjutant-General 
Prince
Volkonski, 
to 
hear 
from 
you 
the 
situation 
of 
the 
army 
and 
the 
reasons
that 
have 
induced 
you 
to 
take 
this 
melancholy
