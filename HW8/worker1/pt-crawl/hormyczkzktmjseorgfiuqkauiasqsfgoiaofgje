CHAPTER 
XVI

Anatole 
had 
lately 
moved 
to 
Dolokhov's. 
The 
plan 
for 
Natalie
Rostova's 
abduction 
had 
been 
arranged 
and 
the 
preparations 
made 
by
Dolokhov 
a 
few 
days 
before, 
and 
on 
the 
day 
that 
Sonya, 
after 
listening
at 
Natasha's 
door, 
resolved 
to 
safeguard 
her, 
it 
was 
to 
have 
been
put 
into 
execution. 
Natasha 
had 
promised 
to 
come 
out 
to 
Kuragin 
at 
the
back 
porch 
at 
ten 
that 
evening. 
Kuragin 
was 
to 
put 
her 
into 
a 
troyka
he 
would 
have 
ready 
and 
to 
drive 
her 
forty 
miles 
to 
the 
village 
of
Kamenka, 
where 
an 
unfrocked 
priest 
was 
in 
readiness 
to 
perform 
a
marriage 
ceremony 
over 
them. 
At 
Kamenka 
a 
relay 
of 
horses 
was 
to 
wait
which 
would 
take 
them 
to 
the 
Warsaw 
highroad, 
and 
from 
there 
they 
would
hasten 
abroad 
with 
post 
horses.

Anatole 
had 
a 
passport, 
an 
order 
for 
post 
horses, 
ten 
thousand 
rubles
he 
had 
taken 
from 
his 
sister 
and 
another 
ten 
thousand 
borrowed 
with
Dolokhov's 
help.

Two 
witnesses 
for 
the 
mock 
marriage-Khvostikov, 
a 
retired 
petty
official 
whom 
Dolokhov 
made 
use 
of 
in 
his 
gambling 
transactions, 
and
Makarin, 
a 
retired 
hussar, 
a 
kindly, 
weak 
fellow 
who 
had 
an 
unbounded
affection 
for 
Kuragin-were 
sitting 
at 
tea 
in 
Dolokhov's 
front
room.

In 
his 
large 
study, 
the 
walls 
of 
which 
were 
hung 
to 
the 
ceiling 
with
Persian 
rugs, 
bearskins, 
and 
weapons, 
sat 
Dolokhov 
in 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Gw7YmejJ1rRC6eI.html">a</a> 
traveling 
cloak
and 
high 
boots, 
at 
an 
open 
desk 
on 
which 
lay 
an 
abacus 
and 
some 
bundles
of 
paper 
money. 
Anatole, 
with 
uniform 
unbuttoned, 
walked 
to 
and 
fro 
from
the 
room 
where 
the 
witnesses 
were 
sitting, 
through 
the 
study 
to 
the 
room
behind, 
where 
his 
French 
valet 
and 
others 
were 
packing 
the 
last 
of 
his
things. 
Dolokhov 
was 
counting 
the 
money 
and 
noting 
something 
down.

"Well," 
he 
said, 
"Khvostikov 
must 
have 
two 
thousand."

"Give 
it 
to 
him, 
then," 
said 
Anatole.

"Makarka" 
(their 
name 
for 
Makarin) 
"will 
go 
through 
fire 
and
water 
for 
you 
for 
nothing. 
So 
here 
are 
our 
accounts 
all 
settled," 
said
Dolokhov, 
showing 
him 
the 
memorandum. 
"Is 
that 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ro6KqZP8Y6NX.html">right?"

"Yes,</a> 
of 
course," 
returned 
Anatole, 
evidently 
not 
listening 
to
Dolokhov 
and 
looking 
straight 
before 
him 
with 
a 
smile 
that 
did 
not
leave 
his 
face.

Dolokhov 
banged 
down 
the 
lid 
of 
his 
desk 
and 
turned 
to 
Anatole 
with 
an
ironic 
smile:

"Do 
you 
know? 
You'd 
really 
better 
drop 
it 
all. 
There's 
still
time!"

"Fool," 
retorted 
Anatole. 
"Don't 
talk 
nonsense! 
If 
you 
only
knew... 
it's 
the 
devil 
knows 
what!"

"No, 
really, 
give 
it 
up!" 
said 
Dolokhov. 
"I 
am 
speaking
seriously. 
It's 
no 
joke, 
this 
plot 
you've 
hatched."

"What, 
teasing 
again? 
Go 
to 
the 
devil! 
Eh?" 
said<p>
Anatole, 
making 
a
grimace. 
"Really 
it's 
no 
time 
for 
your 
stupid 
jokes," 
and 
he 
left
the 
room.

Dolokhov 
smiled 
contemptuously 
and 
condescendingly 
when 
Anatole 
had
gone 
out.

"You 
wait 
a 
bit," 
he 
called 
after 
him. 
"I'm 
not 
joking, 
I'm
talking 
sense. 
Come 
here, 
come 
here!"

Anatole 
returned 
and 
looked 
at 
Dolokhov, 
trying 
to 
give 
him 
his
attention 
and 
evidently 
submitting 
to 
him 
involuntarily.

"Now 
listen 
to 
me. 
I'm 
telling 
you 
this 
for 
the 
last 
time. 
Why
should 
I 
joke 
about 
it? 
Did 
I 
hinder 
you? 
Who 
arranged 
everything 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/iw5i9vWPe0KqZP.html">for
you?</a> 
Who 
found 
the 
priest 
and 
got 
the 
passport? 
Who 
raised 
the 
money? 
I
did 
it 
all."

"Well, 
thank 
you 
for<p>
it. 
Do 
you 
think 
I 
am 
not 
grateful?" 
And
Anatole 
sighed 
and 
embraced 
Dolokhov.

"I 
helped 
you, 
but 
all 
the 
same 
I 
must 
tell 
you
