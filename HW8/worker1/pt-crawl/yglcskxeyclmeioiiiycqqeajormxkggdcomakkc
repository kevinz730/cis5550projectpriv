then 
detached 
ideas 
and 
impressions</h1>from 
the 
world 
of 
reality 
shot
unexpectedly 
through 
his 
mind.

"So 
it 
is 
all 
finished!" 
he 
thought. 
"And 
how 
has 
it 
all 
happened?
How 
quickly! 
Now 
I 
know 
that 
not 
because 
of 
her 
alone, 
nor 
of 
myself
alone, 
but 
because 
of 
everyone, 
it 
must 
inevitably 
come 
about. 
They 
are
all 
expecting 
it, 
they 
are 
so 
sure 
that 
it 
will 
happen 
that 
I 
cannot, 
I
cannot, 
disappoint 
them. 
But 
how 
will 
it 
be? 
I 
do 
not 
know, 
but 
it
will 
certainly 
happen!" 
thought 
Pierre, 
glancing 
at 
those 
dazzling
shoulders 
close 
to 
his 
eyes.

Or 
he 
would 
suddenly 
feel 
ashamed 
of<p>
he 
knew 
not 
what. 
He 
felt 
it
awkward 
to 
attract 
everyone's 
attention 
and 
to 
be 
considered 
a
lucky 
man 
and, 
with 
his 
plain 
face, 
to 
be 
looked 
on 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
Paris
possessed 
of 
a 
Helen. 
"But 
no 
doubt 
it 
always 
is 
and 
must 
be 
so!"
he 
consoled 
himself. 
"And 
besides, 
what 
have 
I 
done 
to 
bring 
it 
about?
How 
did 
it 
begin? 
I 
traveled 
from 
Moscow 
with 
Prince 
Vasili. 
Then 
there
was 
nothing. 
So 
why 
should 
I 
not 
stay 
at 
his 
house? 
Then 
I 
played 
cards
with 
her 
and 
picked 
<a href="/cZl/GZb9NiMWg9o3.html">up</a> 
her 
reticule 
and 
drove 
out 
with 
her. 
How 
did 
it
begin, 
when 
did 
it 
all 
come 
about?" 
And 
here 
he 
was 
sitting 
by 
her
side 
as 
her 
betrothed, 
seeing, 
hearing, 
feeling 
her 
nearness, 
her
breathing, 
her 
movements, 
her 
beauty. 
Then 
it 
would 
suddenly 
seem 
to 
him
that 
it 
was 
not 
she 
but 
he 
was 
so 
unusually 
beautiful, 
and 
that 
that 
was
why 
they 
all 
looked 
so 
at 
him, 
and 
flattered 
by 
this 
general 
admiration
he 
would 
expand 
his 
chest, 
raise 
his 
head, 
and 
rejoice 
at 
his 
good
fortune. 
Suddenly 
he 
heard 
a 
familiar 
voice 
repeating 
something 
to 
him 
a
second 
time. 
But 
Pierre 
was 
so 
absorbed 
that 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
what
was 
said.

"I 
am 
asking 
you 
when 
you 
last 
heard 
from 
Bolkonski," 
repeated
Prince 
Vasili 
a 
third 
time. 
"How 
absent-minded 
you 
are, 
my 
dear
fellow."

Prince 
Vasili 
smiled, 
and 
Pierre 
noticed 
that 
everyone 
was 
smiling 
at
him 
and 
Helene. 
"Well, 
what 
of 
it, 
if 
you 
all 
know 
it?" 
thought
Pierre. 
"What 
of 
it? 
It's 
the 
truth!" 
and 
he 
himself 
smiled 
his
gentle 
childlike 
smile, 
and 
Helene 
smiled 
too.

"When 
did 
you 
get 
the 
letter? 
Was 
it 
from 
Olmuetz?" 
repeated
Prince 
Vasili, 
who 
pretended 
to 
want 
to 
know 
this 
in 
order 
to 
settle 
a
dispute.

"How 
can 
one 
talk 
or 
think 
of 
such 
trifles?" 
thought 
Pierre.

"Yes, 
from 
Olmuetz," 
he 
answered, 
with 
a 
sigh.

After 
supper 
Pierre 
with 
his 
partner 
followed 
the 
others 
into 
the
drawing 
room. 
The 
guests 
began 
to 
disperse, 
some 
without 
taking 
leave
of 
Helene. 
Some, 
as 
if 
unwilling 
to 
distract 
her 
from
