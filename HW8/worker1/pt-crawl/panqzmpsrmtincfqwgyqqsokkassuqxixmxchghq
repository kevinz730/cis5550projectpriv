whole 
attention 
was 
absorbed 
in 
watching 
the 
serious
expression 
on 
the 
faces 
of 
the 
crowd 
of<p>
soldiers 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/NJ7mbEd4UJpiB5.html">militiamen</a> 
who 
were
all 
gazing 
eagerly 
at 
the 
icon. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
tired 
chanters, 
who 
were
singing 
the 
service 
for 
the 
twentieth 
time 
that 
day, 
began 
lazily 
and
mechanically 
to 
sing: 
"Save 
from 
calamity 
Thy 
servants, 
O 
Mother 
of
God," 
and 
the 
priest 
and 
deacon 
chimed 
in: 
"For 
to 
Thee 
under 
God 
we 
all
flee 
as 
to 
an 
inviolable 
bulwark 
and 
protection," 
there 
again 
kindled 
in
all 
those 
faces 
the 
same 
expression 
of 
consciousness 
of 
the 
solemnity
of 
the 
impending 
moment 
that 
Pierre 
had 
seen 
on 
the 
faces 
at 
the 
foot 
of
the 
hill 
at 
Mozhaysk 
and 
momentarily 
on 
many 
and 
many 
faces 
he 
had 
met
that 
morning; 
and 
heads 
were 
bowed 
more 
frequently 
and 
hair 
tossed 
back,
and 
sighs 
and 
the 
sound 
men 
made 
as 
they 
crossed 
themselves 
were 
heard.

The 
crowd 
round 
the 
icon 
suddenly 
parted 
and 
pressed 
against 
Pierre.
Someone, 
a 
very 
important 
personage 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xa2t8Cv2U.html">judging</a> 
by 
the 
haste 
with 
which 
way
was 
made 
for 
him, 
was 
approaching 
the 
icon.

It 
was 
Kutuzov, 
who 
had 
been 
riding 
round 
the 
position 
and 
on 
his 
way
back 
to 
Tatarinova 
had 
stopped 
where 
the 
service 
was 
being
