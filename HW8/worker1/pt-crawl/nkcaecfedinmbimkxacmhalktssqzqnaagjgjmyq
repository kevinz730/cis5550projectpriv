CHAPTER 
IV

Prince 
Andrew 
arrived 
in 
Petersburg 
in 
August, 
1809. 
It 
was 
the 
time
when 
the 
youthful 
Speranski 
was 
at 
the 
zenith 
of 
his 
fame 
and 
his
reforms 
were 
being 
pushed 
forward 
with 
the 
greatest 
energy. 
That 
same
August 
the 
Emperor 
was 
thrown 
from 
his 
caleche, 
injured 
his 
leg, 
and
remained 
three 
weeks 
at 
Peterhof, 
receiving 
Speranski 
every 
day 
and 
no
one 
else. 
At 
that 
time 
the 
two 
famous 
decrees 
were 
being 
prepared
that 
so 
agitated 
society-abolishing 
court 
ranks 
and 
introducing
examinations 
to 
qualify 
for 
the 
grades 
of 
Collegiate 
Assessor 
<a href="/cZl/mf16LgATt.html">and
State</a> 
Councilor-and 
not 
merely 
these 
but 
<a href="/aVzUge/Eq19BwgT0.html">a</a> 
whole 
state 
constitution,
intended 
to 
change 
the 
existing 
order 
of 
government 
in 
Russia: 
legal,
administrative, 
and 
financial, 
from 
the 
Council 
of 
<a href="/cZl/iZ4wvJ89.html">State</a> 
down 
to 
the
district 
tribunals. 
Now 
those 
vague 
liberal 
dreams 
with 
which 
the
Emperor 
Alexander 
had 
ascended 
the 
throne, 
and 
which 
he 
had 
tried 
to 
put
into 
effect 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
his 
associates, 
Czartoryski, 
Novosiltsev,
Kochubey, 
and 
Strogonov-whom 
he 
himself 
in 
jest 
had
