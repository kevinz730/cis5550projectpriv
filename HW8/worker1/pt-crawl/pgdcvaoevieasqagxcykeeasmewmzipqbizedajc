horses 
and 
another 
tearing 
off</h1>a 
munition-wagon
driver's 
leg. 
Their 
spirits 
once 
roused 
were, 
however, 
not 
diminished,
but 
only 
changed 
character. 
The 
horses 
were 
replaced 
by 
others 
from 
a
reserve 
gun 
carriage, 
the 
wounded 
were 
carried 
away, 
and 
the<p>
four 
guns
were 
turned 
against 
the 
ten-gun<p>
battery. 
Tushin's 
companion 
officer
had 
been 
killed 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
engagement 
and 
within 
an 
hour
seventeen 
of 
the 
forty 
men 
of 
the 
guns' 
crews 
<a href="/cZl/bER4STxex0Xjv5qrwB.html">had</a> 
been 
disabled, 
but
the 
artillerymen 
were 
still 
as 
merry 
and 
lively 
as 
ever. 
Twice 
they
noticed 
the 
French 
appearing 
below 
them, 
and 
then 
they 
fired 
grapeshot
at 
them.

Little 
Tushin, 
moving 
feebly 
and 
awkwardly, 
kept 
telling 
his 
orderly 
to
"refill 
my 
pipe 
for 
that 
one!" 
and 
then, 
scattering 
sparks 
from 
it,
ran 
forward 
shading 
his 
eyes 
with 
his 
small 
hand 
to 
look 
at 
the 
French.

"Smack 
at 
'em, 
lads!" 
he 
kept 
saying, 
seizing 
the 
guns 
by 
the
wheels 
and 
working 
the 
screws 
himself.

Amid 
the 
smoke, 
deafened 
by 
the 
incessant 
reports 
which 
always 
made 
him
jump, 
Tushin 
not 
taking 
his 
pipe 
from 
his 
mouth 
ran 
from 
gun 
to 
gun,
now 
aiming, 
now 
counting 
the 
charges, 
now 
giving 
orders 
about 
replacing
dead 
or 
wounded 
horses 
and 
harnessing 
fresh 
ones, 
and 
shouting 
in 
his
feeble 
voice, 
so 
high 
pitched 
and 
irresolute. 
His 
face 
grew 
more 
and
more 
animated. 
Only 
when 
a 
man 
was 
killed 
or 
wounded 
did 
he 
frown 
and
turn 
away 
from 
the 
sight, 
shouting 
angrily 
at 
the 
men 
who, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tB1yf8C0UJpiB.html">as</a> 
is 
always
the 
case, 
hesitated 
about 
lifting 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bq5UTE0jTVGx.html">injured</a> 
or 
dead. 
The 
soldiers,
for 
the 
most 
part 
handsome 
fellows 
and, 
as 
is 
always 
the 
case
