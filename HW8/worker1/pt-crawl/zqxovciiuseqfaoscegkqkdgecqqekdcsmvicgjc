at
any 
rate 
loved 
the 
governing 
Synod 
and 
prayed 
for 
it.

When 
he 
had 
finished 
the 
Litany 
the 
deacon 
crossed 
the 
stole 
over 
his
breast 
and 
said, 
"Let 
us 
commit 
ourselves 
and 
our<p>
whole 
lives 
to 
Christ
the 
Lord!"

"Commit 
ourselves 
to 
God," 
Natasha 
inwardly 
repeated. 
"Lord 
God, 
I
submit 
myself 
to 
Thy 
will!" 
she 
thought. 
"I 
want 
nothing, 
wish 
for
nothing; 
teach 
me 
what 
to 
do 
and 
how 
to 
use 
my 
will! 
Take 
me, 
take
me!" 
prayed 
Natasha, 
with 
impatient 
emotion 
in 
her 
heart, 
not 
crossing
herself 
but 
letting 
her 
slender 
arms 
hang 
down 
as 
if 
expecting 
some
invisible 
power 
at 
any 
moment 
to 
take 
her 
and 
deliver 
her 
from 
herself,
from 
her 
regrets, 
desires, 
remorse, 
hopes, 
and 
sins.

The 
countess 
looked 
round 
several 
times 
at 
her 
daughter's 
softened 
face
and 
shining 
eyes 
and 
prayed 
God 
to 
help 
her.

Unexpectedly, 
in 
the 
middle<p>
of 
the 
service, 
and 
not 
in 
the 
usual 
order
Natasha 
knew 
so 
well, 
the 
deacon 
brought 
out 
a 
small 
stool, 
the 
one 
he
knelt 
on 
when 
praying 
on 
Trinity 
Sunday, 
and 
placed 
it 
before 
the 
doors
of 
the 
sanctuary 
screen. 
The 
priest 
came 
out 
with 
his 
purple 
velvet
biretta 
on 
his 
head, 
adjusted 
his 
hair, 
and 
knelt 
down 
with 
an 
effort.
Everybody 
followed 
his 
example 
and 
they 
looked 
at 
one 
another 
in
surprise. 
Then 
came 
the 
prayer 
just 
received 
from 
the 
Synod-a 
prayer 
for
the 
deliverance 
of 
Russia 
from 
hostile 
invasion.

"Lord 
God 
of 
might, 
God 
of 
our 
salvation!" 
began 
the 
priest 
in 
that
voice, 
clear, 
not 
grandiloquent 
but 
mild, 
in 
which 
only 
the 
Slav 
clergy
read 
and 
which 
acts 
so 
irresistibly 
on 
a 
Russian 
heart.

"Lord 
God 
of<p>
might, 
God 
of 
our<p>
salvation! 
Look 
this 
day 
in 
mercy 
and
blessing 
on 
Thy 
humble 
people, 
and 
graciously 
hear 
us, 
spare 
us, 
and
have 
mercy 
upon 
us! 
This 
foe 
confounding 
Thy 
land, 
desiring 
to 
lay
waste 
the 
whole 
world, 
rises 
against 
us; 
these 
lawless 
men 
are 
gathered
together 
to 
overthrow 
Thy 
kingdom, 
to 
destroy 
Thy 
dear 
Jerusalem, 
Thy
beloved 
Russia; 
to 
defile 
Thy 
temples, 
to 
overthrow 
Thine 
altars, 
and 
to
desecrate 
our 
holy 
shrines. 
How 
long, 
O 
Lord, 
how 
long 
shall 
the 
wicked
triumph? 
How 
long 
shall 
they 
wield 
unlawful 
power?

"Lord 
God! 
Hear 
us 
when 
we 
pray 
to 
Thee; 
strengthen 
with 
Thy 
might
our 
most 
gracious 
sovereign 
lord, 
the 
Emperor 
Alexander 
Pavlovich; 
be
mindful 
of 
his 
uprightness 
and 
meekness, 
reward 
him 
according 
to 
his
righteousness, 
and 
let 
it 
preserve 
us, 
Thy 
chosen 
Israel! 
Bless 
his
counsels, 
his 
undertakings, 
and 
his 
work; 
strengthen 
his 
kingdom 
by
Thine 
almighty 
hand, 
and 
give 
him 
victory 
over 
his 
enemy, 
even 
as 
Thou
gavest 
Moses 
the 
victory 
over 
Amalek, 
Gideon 
over 
Midian, 
and 
David 
over
Goliath. 
Preserve 
his 
army, 
put 
a 
bow 
of 
brass 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
those 
who
have 
armed 
themselves 
in 
Thy 
Name, 
and 
gird 
their 
loins 
with 
strength
for 
the 
fight. 
Take 
up 
the 
spear 
and 
shield
