Paris

boulevards," 
and 
noticing 
that
his 
conclusion 
was 
weaker 
than 
what 
had 
gone 
before, 
he 
added 
quickly:
"There 
is 
only 
one 
Paris 
in 
the 
world. 
You 
have 
been 
to 
Paris 
and 
have
remained 
Russian. 
Well, 
I 
don't 
esteem 
you 
the 
less 
for 
it."

Under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
wine 
he 
had 
drunk, 
and 
after 
the 
days 
he 
had
spent 
alone 
with 
his 
depressing 
thoughts, 
Pierre 
involuntarily 
enjoyed
talking 
with 
this 
cheerful 
and 
good-natured 
man.

"To 
return 
to 
your 
ladies-I<p>
hear 
they 
are 
lovely. 
What 
a 
wretched 
idea
to 
go 
and 
bury 
themselves 
in 
the 
steppes 
when 
the 
French 
army 
is 
in
Moscow. 
What 
a 
chance 
those 
girls 
have 
missed! 
Your 
peasants, 
now-that's
another 
thing; 
but 
you 
civilized 
people, 
you 
ought 
to 
know 
us 
better
than 
that. 
We 
took 
Vienna, 
Berlin, 
Madrid, 
Naples, 
Rome, 
Warsaw, 
all
the 
world's 
capitals.... 
We 
are 
feared, 
but 
we 
are 
loved. 
We 
are 
nice 
to
know. 
And 
then 
the 
Emperor..." 
he 
began, 
but 
Pierre 
interrupted 
him.

"The 
Emperor," 
Pierre 
repeated, 
and 
his 
face 
suddenly 
became 
sad 
and
embarrassed, 
"is 
the 
Emperor...?"

"The 
Emperor? 
He 
is 
generosity, 
mercy, 
justice, 
order, 
genius-that's
what 
the 
Emperor 
is! 
It 
is 
I, 
Ramballe, 
who 
tell 
you 
so.... 
I 
assure 
you
I 
was 
his 
enemy 
eight 
years 
ago. 
My 
father 
was 
an 
emigrant 
count.... 
But
that 
man 
has 
vanquished 
me. 
He 
has 
taken 
hold 
of 
me. 
I 
could 
not 
resist
the 
sight 
of 
the 
grandeur 
and 
glory 
with 
which 
he 
has<p>
covered 
France.
When 
I 
understood 
what 
he 
wanted-when 
I 
saw 
that 
he 
was 
preparing 
a 
bed
of 
laurels 
for 
us, 
you 
know, 
I 
said 
to 
myself: 
'That 
is 
a 
monarch,' 
and
I 
devoted 
myself 
to 
him! 
So 
there! 
Oh 
yes, 
mon 
cher, 
he 
is 
the 
greatest
man 
of 
the 
ages 
past 
or 
future."

"Is 
he 
in 
Moscow?" 
Pierre 
stammered 
with 
a 
guilty 
look.

The 
Frenchman 
looked 
at 
his 
guilty 
face 
and 
smiled.

"No, 
he 
will 
make 
his 
entry 
tomorrow," 
he 
replied, 
and 
continued 
his
talk.

Their 
conversation 
was 
interrupted 
by 
the 
cries 
of 
several 
voices 
at
the 
gate 
and 
by 
Morel, 
who 
came 
to 
say 
that
