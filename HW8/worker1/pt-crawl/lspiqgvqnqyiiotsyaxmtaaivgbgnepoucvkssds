commander 
in</h1>chief 
is 
never 
dealing 
with
the 
beginning 
of 
any 
event-the 
position 
from 
which 
we 
always 
contemplate
it. 
The 
commander 
in 
chief 
is 
always 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
a 
series 
of
shifting 
events 
and 
so 
he 
never 
can 
at 
any 
moment 
consider 
the 
whole
import 
of 
an 
event 
that 
is 
occurring. 
Moment 
by 
moment 
the 
event 
is
imperceptibly 
shaping 
itself, 
and 
at 
every 
moment 
of 
this 
continuous,
uninterrupted 
shaping 
of 
events 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
is 
in<p>
the
midst 
of 
a 
most 
complex 
play 
of 
intrigues, 
worries, 
contingencies,
authorities, 
projects, 
counsels, 
threats, 
and 
deceptions 
and 
is
continually 
obliged 
to 
reply 
to 
innumerable 
questions 
addressed 
to 
him,
which 
constantly 
conflict 
with 
one 
another.

Learned 
military 
authorities 
quite 
seriously 
tell 
us 
that 
Kutuzov 
should
have 
moved 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/qa6K55.html">his</a> 
army 
to 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
long 
before 
reaching 
Fili, 
and
that 
somebody 
actually 
submitted 
such 
a 
proposal 
to 
him.
