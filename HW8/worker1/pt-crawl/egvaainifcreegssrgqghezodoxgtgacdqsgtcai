for

her 
love-uttered 
at 
a 
moment 
when 
she 
was
so 
strongly 
agitated, 
Pierre<p>
never 
spoke 
to 
Natasha 
of 
his 
feelings;
and 
it 
seemed 
plain 
to 
her 
that 
those 
words, 
which 
had 
then 
so 
comforted
her, 
were 
spoken 
as 
all 
sorts 
of 
meaningless 
words 
are 
spoken 
to 
comfort
a 
crying 
child. 
It 
was 
not 
because 
Pierre 
was 
a 
married 
man, 
but 
<a href="/aVzUge/yG8p.html">because
Natasha</a> 
felt 
very 
strongly 
with 
him 
that 
moral 
barrier 
the 
absence 
of
which 
she 
had 
experienced 
with 
Kuragin 
that 
it 
never 
entered 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Qb7OfLLj2oFuln5tEu.html">her</a> 
head
that 
the 
relations 
between 
<a href="/cZl/txm5p1lOZ9GdRBS.html">him</a> 
and 
herself 
<a href="/cZl/jRO3YXnB5A5mDKi.html">could</a> 
lead 
to 
love 
on 
her
part, 
still 
less 
on 
his, 
or 
even 
to 
the 
kind 
of 
tender, 
self-conscious,
romantic 
friendship 
between 
a 
man 
and 
a 
woman 
of 
which 
she 
had 
known
several 
instances.

Before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fast 
of 
St. 
Peter, 
Agrafena 
Ivanovna 
Belova, 
a
country 
neighbor 
of 
the 
Rostovs, 
came 
to 
Moscow 
to 
pay 
her 
devotions 
at
the 
shrines 
of 
the 
Moscow 
saints. 
She 
suggested 
that 
Natasha 
should 
fast
and 
prepare 
for 
Holy 
Communion, 
and 
Natasha 
gladly 
welcomed 
the 
idea.
Despite 
the 
doctor's 
orders 
that 
she 
should 
not 
go 
out 
early 
in 
the
morning, 
Natasha 
insisted 
on 
fasting 
and 
preparing 
for 
the 
sacrament,
not 
as 
they 
generally 
prepared 
for 
it 
in 
the 
Rostov 
family 
by 
attending
three 
services 
in 
their 
own 
house, 
but 
as 
Agrafena 
Ivanovna 
did, 
by
going 
to 
church 
every 
day 
for 
a 
week 
and 
not 
once 
missing 
Vespers,
Matins, 
or 
Mass.

The 
countess 
was 
pleased 
with 
Natasha's 
zeal; 
after 
the 
poor 
results 
of
the 
medical 
treatment, 
in 
the 
depths 
of 
her 
heart 
she 
hoped 
that 
prayer
might 
help 
her 
daughter 
more 
than 
medicines 
and, 
though 
not 
without
fear 
and<p>
concealing 
it 
from 
the 
doctor, 
she 
agreed 
to 
Natasha's 
wish 
and
entrusted 
her 
to 
Belova. 
Agrafena 
Ivanovna 
used 
to 
come 
to 
wake 
Natasha
at 
three 
in 
the 
morning, 
but 
generally 
found 
her 
already 
awake. 
She 
was
afraid 
of 
being 
late 
for 
Matins. 
Hastily 
washing, 
and 
meekly 
putting 
on
her 
shabbiest 
dress 
and 
an 
old 
mantilla, 
Natasha, 
shivering 
in 
the 
fresh
air, 
went 
out 
into 
the 
deserted 
streets 
lit 
by 
the 
clear 
light 
of 
dawn.
By 
Agrafena 
Ivanovna's 
advice 
Natasha 
prepared 
herself 
not 
in 
their
own 
parish, 
but 
at 
a 
church 
where, 
according 
to 
the 
devout 
Agrafena
Ivanovna, 
the 
priest 
was 
a 
man 
of 
very 
severe 
and 
lofty 
life. 
There 
were
never 
many 
people 
in 
the 
church; 
Natasha 
always 
stood 
beside 
Belova 
in
the 
customary 
place 
before 
an 
icon 
of 
the 
Blessed 
Virgin, 
let 
into 
the
screen 
before 
the 
choir 
on 
the 
left 
side, 
and 
a 
feeling, 
new 
to 
her, 
of
humility 
before 
something 
great 
and 
incomprehensible, 
seized 
her 
when
at 
that 
unusual 
morning 
hour, 
gazing 
at 
the 
dark 
face 
of 
the 
Virgin
illuminated 
by 
the 
candles 
burning 
before 
it 
and 
by 
the 
morning 
light
falling 
from 
the 
window, 
she 
listened 
to 
the 
words 
of 
the 
service 
which
she 
tried 
to 
follow 
with 
understanding. 
When 
she 
understood 
them
