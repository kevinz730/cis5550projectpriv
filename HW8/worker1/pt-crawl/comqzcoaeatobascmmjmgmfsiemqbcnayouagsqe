and 
foreigners 
who 
propounded</h1>new 
and 
unexpected
ideas 
every 
day-especially 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/Eq19BwgT0.html">foreigners,</a> 
who 
did 
so 
with 
a 
boldness
characteristic 
of 
people 
employed 
in 
a 
country 
not 
their 
own-there 
were
many 
secondary 
personages 
accompanying 
the 
army 
because 
their 
principals
were 
there.

Among 
the 
opinions 
and 
voices 
in 
this 
immense, 
restless, 
brilliant,
and 
proud 
sphere, 
Prince 
Andrew 
noticed 
the 
following 
sharply 
defined
subdivisions 
of 
tendencies 
and 
parties:

The 
first 
party 
consisted 
of 
Pfuel 
and 
his 
adherents-military 
theorists
who 
believed 
in 
a 
science 
of 
war 
with 
immutable 
laws-laws 
of 
oblique
movements, 
outflankings, 
and 
so 
forth. 
Pfuel 
and 
his 
adherents 
demanded
a 
retirement 
into 
the 
depths 
of 
the 
country 
in 
accordance 
with 
precise
laws 
defined 
by 
a 
pseudo-theory 
of 
war, 
and 
they 
saw 
only 
barbarism,
ignorance, 
or 
evil 
intention 
in 
every 
deviation 
from 
that 
theory. 
To
this 
party 
belonged 
the 
foreign 
nobles, 
Wolzogen, 
Wintzingerode, 
and
others, 
chiefly 
Germans.

The 
second 
party 
was 
directly 
opposed 
to 
the 
first; 
one 
extreme, 
as
always 
happens, 
was 
met 
by 
representatives 
of 
the 
other. 
The 
members 
of
this 
party<p>
were 
those 
who 
had 
demanded 
an 
advance 
from 
Vilna 
into 
Poland
and 
freedom 
from 
all 
prearranged 
plans. 
Besides 
being 
advocates 
of 
bold
action, 
this 
section 
also 
represented 
nationalism, 
which 
made 
them 
still
