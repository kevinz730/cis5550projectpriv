back 
with
the 
flagstaff 
that 
had</h1>been 
dropped 
beside 
him. 
(The 
flag 
had 
already
been 
taken 
by 
the 
French 
as 
a 
trophy.)

"That's 
a 
fine 
death!" 
said 
Napoleon 
as 
he 
gazed 
at 
Bolkonski.

Prince 
Andrew 
understood 
that 
this 
was 
said 
of 
him 
and 
that 
it 
was
Napoleon 
who 
said 
it. 
He 
heard 
the 
speaker 
addressed 
as 
Sire. 
But 
he
heard 
the 
words 
as 
he 
might 
have 
heard 
the 
buzzing 
of 
a 
fly. 
Not 
only
did 
they 
not 
interest 
him, 
but 
he 
took 
no 
notice 
of 
them 
and 
at 
once
forgot 
them. 
His 
head 
was 
burning, 
he 
felt 
himself 
bleeding 
to 
death,
and 
he 
saw 
above 
<a href="/aVzUge/kH5ieWTn1Qc1on.html">him</a> 
the 
remote, 
lofty, 
and 
everlasting 
sky. 
He 
knew 
it
was 
Napoleon-his 
hero-but 
at 
that 
moment 
Napoleon 
seemed 
to 
him
such 
a 
small, 
insignificant 
creature 
compared 
with 
what 
was 
passing 
now
between 
himself 
and 
that 
lofty 
infinite 
sky 
with 
the 
clouds 
flying 
over
it. 
At 
that 
moment 
it 
meant 
nothing 
to 
him 
who 
might 
be 
standing 
over
him, 
or 
what 
was 
said 
of 
him; 
he 
was 
only 
glad 
that 
people 
were 
standing
near 
him<p>
and 
only 
wished 
that 
they 
would 
help 
him 
and 
bring 
him 
back 
to
life, 
which 
seemed 
to 
him 
so 
beautiful 
now 
that 
he 
had 
today 
learned 
to
understand 
it 
so 
differently. 
He 
collected 
all 
his 
strength, 
to 
stir 
and
utter 
a 
sound. 
He 
feebly 
moved 
his 
leg 
and 
uttered 
a 
weak, 
sickly 
groan
which 
aroused 
his 
own 
pity.

"Ah! 
He 
is 
alive," 
said 
Napoleon. 
"Lift 
this 
young 
man 
up 
and
carry 
him 
to 
the 
dressing 
station."

Having 
said 
this, 
Napoleon 
rode 
on 
to 
meet 
Marshal 
Lannes, 
who, 
hat 
in
hand, 
rode 
up 
smiling 
to 
the 
Emperor 
to 
congratulate 
him 
on 
the 
victory.

Prince 
Andrew 
remembered 
nothing 
more: 
he 
lost 
consciousness 
from 
the
terrible 
pain 
of 
being 
lifted 
onto 
the 
stretcher, 
the 
jolting 
while
being 
moved, 
and 
the 
probing 
of 
his 
wound 
at 
the 
dressing 
station.
He 
did 
not 
regain 
consciousness 
till 
late 
in 
the 
day, 
when 
with 
other
wounded 
and 
captured 
Russian 
officers 
he 
was 
carried 
to 
the 
hospital.
During 
this 
transfer 
he 
felt 
a 
little 
stronger 
and 
was 
able 
to 
look
about 
him 
and 
even 
speak.

The 
first 
words 
he 
heard 
on 
coming 
to 
his 
senses 
were 
those 
of 
a 
French
convoy 
officer, 
who 
said 
rapidly: 
"We 
must 
halt 
here: 
the 
Emperor
will 
pass 
here 
immediately; 
it 
will 
please 
him 
to 
see 
these 
gentlemen
prisoners."

"There 
are 
so 
many 
prisoners 
today, 
nearly 
the 
whole 
Russian 
army,
that 
he 
is 
probably 
tired 
of 
them," 
said 
another 
officer.

"All<p>
the 
same!<p>
They 
say 
this 
one 
is 
the 
commander 
of 
all 
the 
Emperor
Alexander's 
Guards," 
said 
the 
first 
one, 
indicating 
a 
Russian
officer 
in 
the 
white 
uniform 
of 
the 
Horse 
Guards.

Bolkonski 
recognized 
Prince 
Repnin 
whom 
he 
had 
met 
in 
Petersburg
society. 
Beside 
him 
stood 
a 
lad 
of 
nineteen, 
also 
a 
wounded 
officer 
of
the 
Horse 
Guards.

Bonaparte, 
having 
come 
up 
at 
a 
gallop, 
stopped 
his 
horse.

"Which 
is 
the 
senior?" 
he 
asked, 
on 
seeing 
the 
prisoners.

They 
named 
the 
colonel, 
Prince 
Repnin.

"You 
are 
the 
commander 
of 
the 
Emperor 
Alexander's 
regiment 
of 
Horse
Guards?" 
asked 
Napoleon.

"I 
commanded 
a 
squadron," 
replied 
Repnin.

"Your 
regiment 
fulfilled 
its 
duty 
honorably," 
said 
Napoleon.

"The 
praise 
of 
a 
great 
commander 
is 
a 
soldier's 
highest 
reward,"
said 
Repnin.

"I 
bestow 
it 
with 
pleasure," 
said 
Napoleon. 
"And 
who 
is 
that 
young
man 
beside 
you?"

Prince 
Repnin 
named 
Lieutenant 
Sukhtelen.

After 
looking 
at 
him 
Napoleon 
smiled.

"He's 
very<p>
young 
to 
come 
to 
meddle 
with 
us."

"Youth 
is 
no 
hindrance 
to 
courage," 
muttered 
Sukhtelen 
in 
a 
failing
voice.

"A 
splendid 
reply!" 
said 
Napoleon.
