open 
the</h1>bearskin 
cloak 
from 
his 
broad 
chest 
and 
inhaled 
the
air 
with 
joy.

It 
was 
clear 
and 
frosty. 
Above 
the 
dirty, 
ill-lit 
streets, 
above 
the
black 
roofs, 
stretched 
the 
<a href="/cZl/ok23dcFeE6hW.html">dark</a> 
starry 
sky. 
Only 
looking 
up 
at 
the 
sky
did 
Pierre 
cease 
to 
feel 
how 
sordid 
and 
humiliating 
were 
all 
mundane
things 
compared 
with 
the 
heights 
to 
which 
his 
soul 
had 
just 
been 
raised.
At 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oe3HI7T4kBL.html">entrance</a> 
to 
the 
Arbat 
Square 
an 
immense 
expanse 
of 
dark 
<a href="/aVzUge/HVx6Nc7rP3.html">starry
sky</a> 
presented 
itself 
to 
his 
eyes. 
Almost 
in 
the 
center 
of 
it, 
above 
the
Prechistenka 
Boulevard, 
surrounded 
and 
sprinkled 
on 
all 
sides 
by 
stars
but 
distinguished 
from 
them 
all 
by 
its 
nearness 
to 
the 
earth, 
its 
white
light, 
and 
its 
long 
uplifted 
tail, 
shone 
the 
enormous 
and 
brilliant
comet 
of 
1812-the 
comet 
which 
was 
said 
to 
portend 
all 
kinds 
of 
woes
and 
the 
end 
of 
the 
world. 
In 
Pierre, 
however, 
that 
comet 
with 
its 
long
luminous 
tail 
aroused 
no 
feeling 
of 
fear. 
On 
the 
contrary 
he 
gazed
joyfully, 
his 
eyes 
moist 
with 
tears, 
at 
this 
bright 
comet 
which, 
having
traveled 
in 
its 
orbit 
with 
inconceivable 
velocity 
through 
immeasurable
space, 
seemed 
suddenly-like 
an 
arrow 
piercing 
the 
earth-to 
remain
fixed 
in 
a 
chosen 
spot, 
vigorously 
holding 
its 
tail 
erect, 
shining 
and
displaying 
its 
white 
light 
amid 
countless<p>
other 
scintillating 
stars. 
It
seemed 
to 
Pierre 
that 
this 
comet 
fully 
responded 
to 
what 
was 
passing 
in
his 
own 
softened 
and 
uplifted 
soul, 
now 
blossoming 
into 
a 
new 
life.
