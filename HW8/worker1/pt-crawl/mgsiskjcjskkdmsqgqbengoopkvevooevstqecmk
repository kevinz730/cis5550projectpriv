The</a> 
Emperor 
turned 
with 
a 
smile 
to 
one 
of

followers

CHAPTER 
XVI

Kutuzov 
accompanied 
by 
his 
adjutants 
rode 
at 
a 
walking 
pace 
behind<p>
the
carabineers.

When 
he 
had 
gone 
less 
than 
half 
a 
mile 
in 
the 
rear 
of 
the 
column 
he
stopped 
at 
a 
solitary, 
deserted 
house 
that 
had 
probably 
once 
been 
an
inn, 
where 
two 
roads 
parted. 
Both 
of 
them 
led 
downhill 
and 
troops 
were
marching 
along 
both.

The 
fog 
had 
begun 
to 
clear 
and 
enemy 
troops 
were 
already 
dimly 
visible
about 
a 
mile 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/fh7Z0CKY5iw.html">and</a> 
a 
half 
off 
on 
the 
opposite 
heights. 
Down 
below, 
on
the 
left, 
the 
firing 
became 
more 
distinct. 
Kutuzov 
had 
stopped 
and 
was
speaking 
to 
an 
Austrian 
general. 
Prince 
Andrew, 
who 
was 
a 
little 
behind
looking 
at 
them, 
turned 
to 
an 
adjutant 
to 
ask 
him 
for 
a 
field 
glass.

"Look, 
look!" 
said 
this 
adjutant, 
looking 
not 
at 
the 
troops 
in 
the
distance, 
but 
down 
the 
hill 
<a href="/aVzUge/lnA2Q68tvrb.html">before</a> 
him. 
"It's 
the 
French!"

The 
two 
generals 
and 
the 
adjutant 
took 
hold 
of 
the 
field 
glass, 
trying
to 
snatch 
it 
from 
one 
another. 
The 
expression 
on 
all 
their 
faces
suddenly 
changed 
to 
one 
of 
horror. 
The 
French 
were 
supposed 
to 
be 
a
mile 
and 
a 
half 
away, 
but 
had 
suddenly 
and 
unexpectedly 
appeared 
just 
in
front 
of 
us.

"It's 
the 
enemy?... 
No!... 
Yes, 
see 
it 
is!... 
for 
certain.... 
But
how 
is 
that?" 
said 
different 
voices.

With 
the 
naked 
eye 
Prince 
Andrew 
saw 
below 
them 
to 
the 
right, 
<a href="/aVzUge/qB20YmejJ3qrOH.html">not</a> 
more
than 
five 
hundred 
paces 
from 
where 
Kutuzov 
was 
standing, 
a 
dense 
French
column 
coming 
up 
to 
meet 
the 
Apsherons.

"Here 
it 
is! 
The 
decisive 
moment 
has 
arrived. 
My 
turn 
has 
come,"
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
and 
striking 
his 
horse 
he 
rode 
up 
to 
Kutuzov.

"The 
Apsherons 
must 
be 
stopped, 
your 
excellency," 
cried 
he. 
But 
at
that 
very 
instant 
a 
cloud 
of 
smoke 
spread 
<a href="/aVzUge/mx1EnBVm2o0EoOV.html">all</a> 
round, 
firing 
was 
heard
quite 
close 
at 
hand, 
and 
a 
voice 
of 
naive 
terror 
barely 
two 
steps 
from
Prince 
Andrew 
shouted, 
"Brothers! 
All's 
lost!"
