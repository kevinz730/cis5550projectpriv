if
we 
had</h1>not 
religion 
to 
console 
us 
life 
would 
be 
very 
sad. 
Why 
do 
you
suppose 
that 
I 
should 
look 
severely 
on 
your 
affection 
for 
that<p>
young
man? 
On 
such 
matters 
I 
am 
only 
severe 
with 
myself. 
I 
understand 
such
feelings 
in 
others, 
and 
if 
never 
having 
felt 
them 
I 
cannot 
approve 
of
them, 
neither 
do 
I 
condemn 
them. 
Only 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
Christian
love, 
love 
of 
one's 
neighbor, 
love 
of 
one's 
enemy, 
is 
worthier,
sweeter, 
and 
better 
than 
the 
feelings 
which 
the 
beautiful 
eyes 
of 
a
young 
man 
can 
inspire 
in 
a 
romantic 
and 
loving 
young 
girl 
like 
yourself.

The 
news 
of 
Count 
Bezukhov's 
death 
reached 
us 
before 
your 
letter
and 
my 
father 
was 
much 
affected 
by 
it. 
He 
says 
the 
count 
was 
the 
last
representative 
but 
one 
of 
the 
great 
century, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
his 
own
turn 
now, 
but 
that 
he 
will 
do 
all 
he 
can 
to 
let 
his 
turn 
come 
as 
late 
as
possible. 
God 
preserve 
us 
from 
that 
terrible 
misfortune!

I 
cannot 
agree 
with 
you 
about 
Pierre, 
whom 
I 
knew 
as 
a 
child. 
He 
always
seemed 
to 
me 
to 
have 
an 
excellent 
heart, 
and 
that 
is 
the 
quality 
I 
value
most<p>
in 
people. 
As 
to 
his 
inheritance 
and 
the 
part 
played 
by 
Prince
Vasili, 
it 
is 
very 
sad 
for 
both. 
Ah, 
my 
dear 
friend, 
our 
divine
Saviour's 
words, 
that 
it 
is 
easier 
for 
a 
camel 
to 
go 
through 
the
eye 
of 
a 
needle 
than 
for 
a 
rich 
man 
to 
enter 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
God, 
are
terribly 
true. 
I 
pity 
Prince 
Vasili 
but 
am 
still 
more 
sorry 
for 
Pierre.
So 
young, 
and 
burdened 
with 
such 
riches-to 
what 
temptations 
he 
will 
be
exposed! 
If 
I 
were 
asked 
what 
I 
desire 
most 
on 
earth, 
it 
would 
be 
to 
be
poorer 
than 
the 
poorest 
beggar. 
A 
thousand 
thanks, 
dear 
friend, 
for 
the
volume 
you 
have 
sent 
me 
and 
which 
has 
such 
success 
in 
Moscow. 
Yet 
since
you 
tell 
me 
that 
among 
some 
good 
things 
it 
contains 
others 
which 
our
weak 
human 
understanding 
cannot 
grasp, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
rather 
useless 
to
spend 
time 
in 
reading 
what 
is 
unintelligible 
and 
can 
therefore 
bear
no 
fruit. 
I 
never 
could 
understand 
the 
fondness 
some 
people 
have 
for
confusing 
their 
minds 
by 
dwelling 
on 
mystical 
books 
that 
merely 
awaken
their 
doubts 
and 
excite 
their 
imagination, 
giving 
them 
a 
bent 
for
exaggeration 
quite<p>
contrary 
to 
Christian 
simplicity. 
Let 
us 
rather 
read
the 
Epistles 
and 
Gospels. 
Let 
us 
not 
seek 
to 
penetrate 
what 
mysteries
they 
contain; 
for 
how 
can 
we, 
miserable 
sinners 
that 
we 
are, 
know
