remain 
unexecuted. 
Only 
the 
possible 
ones 
get 
linked 
up 
<a href="/cZl/qv22GLY3BAcC.html">with</a> 
a
consecutive 
series 
of 
commands 
corresponding 
to 
a 
series 
of 
events, 
and
are 
executed.

Our 
false 
conception 
that 
an 
event 
is 
caused 
by 
a 
command 
which 
precedes
it 
is 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
<a href="/cZl/tK7pufMC.html">when</a> 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ga8Qc63.html">the</a> 
event 
has 
taken 
place 
and 
out 
of
thousands 
of 
others 
those<p>
few 
commands 
which 
were 
consistent 
with 
that
event 
<a href="/cZl/Nt6tEu8EXJo4b.html">have</a> 
been 
executed, 
we 
forget 
about 
the 
others 
that 
were 
not
executed 
because 
they 
could 
not 
be. 
Apart 
from 
that, 
the 
chief 
source
of 
our 
error 
in 
this 
matter 
is 
due 
to 
the 
fact 
that 
in 
the 
historical
accounts 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
innumerable, 
diverse, 
and 
petty 
events, 
such
for 
instance 
as 
all 
those 
which 
led 
the 
French 
armies 
to 
Russia, 
is
generalized 
into 
one 
event 
in 
accord
