CHAPTER 
VII

Two 
of 
the 
enemy's 
shots 
had 
already 
flown 
across 
the 
bridge, 
where
there 
was 
a 
crush. 
Halfway 
across 
stood 
Prince 
Nesvitski, 
who 
had
alighted 
from 
his 
horse 
and 
whose 
big 
body 
was 
jammed 
against 
the
railings. 
He 
looked 
back 
laughing 
to 
the 
Cossack 
who 
stood 
a 
few
steps 
behind 
him 
holding 
two 
horses 
by 
their 
bridles. 
Each 
time 
Prince
Nesvitski 
tried 
to 
move 
on, 
soldiers 
and 
carts 
pushed 
him 
back 
again
and 
pressed 
him 
against 
the 
railings, 
and 
all 
he 
could 
do 
was 
to 
smile.

"What 
a 
fine 
fellow 
you 
are, 
friend!" 
said 
the 
Cossack 
to 
a 
convoy
soldier 
with 
a 
wagon, 
who 
was 
pressing 
onto 
the 
infantrymen 
who 
were
crowded<p>
together 
close 
to 
his 
wheels 
and 
his 
horses. 
"What 
a<p>
fellow!
You 
can't 
wait 
a 
moment! 
Don't 
you 
see 
the 
general 
wants 
to 
pass?"

But 
the 
convoyman 
took 
no 
notice 
of 
the 
word 
"general" 
and<p>
shouted
at 
the 
soldiers 
who 
were 
blocking 
his 
way. 
"Hi 
there, 
boys! 
Keep 
to
the 
left! 
Wait 
a 
bit." 
But 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Bw1ws4vVJZj8mJ.html">soldiers,</a> 
crowded 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/kI50jl0AHAK.html">together</a>

to
shoulder, 
their 
bayonets 
interlocking, 
moved 
over 
the 
<a href="/cZl/nZs6gcnoA49FW.html">bridge</a> 
in 
a 
dense
mass. 
Looking 
down 
over 
the 
rails 
Prince 
Nesvitski 
saw 
the 
rapid, 
noisy
little 
waves 
of 
the 
Enns, 
which 
<a href="/aVzUge/tL5Uijd5rqw1xgX.html">rippling</a> 
and 
eddying 
round 
the 
piles 
of
the 
bridge 
chased
