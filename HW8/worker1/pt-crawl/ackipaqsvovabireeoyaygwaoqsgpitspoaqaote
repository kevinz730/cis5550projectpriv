CHAPTER 
XX

After 
Pierre's 
departure 
that 
first 
evening, 
when<p>
Natasha 
had 
said<p>
to
Princess 
Mary 
with 
a 
gaily 
mocking 
smile: 
"He 
looks 
just, 
yes, 
just 
as
if 
he 
had 
come 
out 
of 
a 
Russian 
bath-in 
a 
short 
coat 
and 
with 
his 
hair
cropped," 
something 
hidden 
and 
unknown 
to 
herself, 
but 
irrepressible,
awoke 
in 
Natasha's 
soul.

Everything: 
her 
face, 
walk, 
<a href="/cZl/Wj2NDX9oP3vuxZ.html">look,</a> 
and 
voice, 
was 
suddenly 
altered.
To 
her 
own 
surprise 
a 
power 
of 
life 
and 
hope 
of 
happiness 
rose 
to 
the
surface<p>
and 
demanded 
satisfaction. 
From 
that 
evening 
she 
seemed 
to 
have
forgotten 
all 
that 
had 
happened 
to 
her. 
She 
no 
longer 
complained 
of<p>
her
position, 
did 
not 
say 
a 
word 
about 
the 
past, 
and 
no 
longer 
feared 
to
make 
happy 
plans 
for 
the 
future. 
She 
spoke 
little 
of 
Pierre, 
but 
when
Princess 
Mary 
mentioned 
him 
a<p>
long-extinguished 
light 
once 
more 
kindled
in 
her 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/dK1UQ3cw6UeLS.html">eyes</a> 
and 
her 
lips 
curved 
with 
a 
strange 
smile.

The 
change 
that 
took 
place 
in 
Natasha 
at 
first 
surprised 
Princess 
Mary;
but 
when 
she 
understood 
its 
meaning 
it 
grieved 
her. 
"Can 
she 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ta6G6LZ8Dj.html">have</a> 
loved
my 
brother 
so 
little 
as 
to 
be 
able 
to 
forget 
him 
so 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mM4sVDPn5bE7EwE.html">soon?"</a> 
she 
thought
when 
she 
reflected 
on 
the 
change. 
But 
when 
she 
was 
with 
Natasha 
she 
was
not 
vexed 
with 
her 
and 
did 
not 
reproach 
her. 
The 
reawakened 
power
of 
life
