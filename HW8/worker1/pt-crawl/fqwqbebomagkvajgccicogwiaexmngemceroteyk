the</h1>first 
of 
September 
when
the 
army 
drew 
near 
Moscow-despite 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
feeling 
that 
had
arisen 
in 
all 
ranks-the 
force 
of 
circumstances 
compelled 
it 
to 
retire
beyond 
Moscow. 
And 
the<p>
troops 
retired 
one 
more, 
last, 
day's 
march, 
and
abandoned 
Moscow 
to 
the 
enemy.

For 
people 
accustomed 
to 
think 
that 
plans 
of 
campaign 
and 
battles 
are
made 
by 
generals-as 
anyone 
of 
us 
sitting 
over 
a 
map 
in 
his 
study 
may
imagine 
how 
he 
would 
have 
arranged 
things 
in 
this 
or 
that 
battle-the
questions 
present 
themselves: 
Why 
did 
Kutuzov 
during 
the 
retreat 
not 
do
this 
or 
that? 
Why 
did 
he 
not 
take 
up 
a 
position 
before 
reaching 
Fili?
Why 
did 
he 
not 
retire 
at 
once 
by 
the 
Kaluga 
road, 
abandoning 
Moscow? 
and
so 
on. 
People 
accustomed 
to 
think 
in 
that 
way 
forget, 
or 
do 
not 
know,
the 
inevitable 
conditions 
which 
always 
limit 
the 
activities 
of 
any
commander 
in 
chief. 
The 
activity 
of 
a 
commander 
in 
chief 
does 
not 
at 
all
resemble 
the 
activity 
we 
imagine 
to 
ourselves 
when 
we 
sit 
at 
ease 
in
our 
studies 
examining 
some 
campaign 
on 
the 
map, 
with 
a 
certain 
number 
of
troops 
on 
this 
and 
that 
side 
in 
a 
certain 
known 
locality, 
and 
begin 
our
plans 
from 
some 
given 
moment. 
A 
commander 
in 
chief 
is 
never 
dealing 
with
the 
beginning 
of 
any 
event-the 
position 
from 
which 
we 
always 
contemplate
it. 
The 
commander 
in 
chief 
is 
always 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
a 
series 
of
shifting 
events 
and 
so 
he 
never 
can 
at 
any 
moment 
consider 
the 
whole
import 
of 
an 
event 
that 
is 
occurring. 
Moment 
by 
moment 
the 
event 
is
imperceptibly 
shaping 
itself, 
and 
at 
every 
moment 
of 
this 
continuous,
uninterrupted 
shaping 
of 
events 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
is 
in 
the
midst 
of 
a 
most 
complex 
play 
of 
intrigues, 
worries, 
contingencies,
authorities, 
projects, 
counsels, 
threats, 
and 
deceptions 
and 
is
continually 
obliged 
to 
reply 
to 
innumerable 
questions 
addressed 
to 
him,
which 
constantly 
conflict 
with 
one 
another.

Learned 
military 
authorities 
quite 
seriously 
tell 
us 
that 
Kutuzov 
should
have 
moved 
his 
army 
to 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
long 
before 
reaching 
Fili, 
and
that 
somebody 
actually 
submitted 
such 
a 
proposal 
to 
him. 
But 
a 
commander
in 
chief, 
especially 
at 
a 
difficult 
moment, 
has 
always 
before 
him<p>
not
one 
proposal 
but 
dozens 
simultaneously. 
And 
all 
these 
proposals, 
based
on 
strategics 
and 
tactics, 
contradict 
each 
other.

A 
commander 
in 
chief's 
business, 
it 
would 
seem, 
is 
simply 
to 
choose 
one
of 
these 
projects. 
But 
even 
that 
he 
cannot 
do. 
Events 
and 
time 
do 
not
wait. 
For 
instance, 
on 
the 
twenty-eighth 
it 
is 
suggested 
to 
him 
to
cross 
to 
the 
Kaluga 
road, 
but 
just 
then 
an 
adjutant 
gallops 
up 
from
Miloradovich 
asking 
whether 
he 
is 
to 
engage 
the 
French 
or 
retire. 
An
order 
must 
be 
given 
him 
at 
once, 
that 
instant. 
And<p>
the 
order 
to 
retreat
carries 
us 
past 
the 
turn 
to 
the 
Kaluga 
road. 
And 
after 
the 
adjutant
comes 
the 
commissary 
general 
asking 
where 
the 
stores 
are 
to 
be 
taken,
and 
the 
chief 
of 
the 
hospitals 
asks 
where 
the 
wounded 
are 
to 
go, 
and 
a
courier 
from 
Petersburg 
brings 
a 
letter<p>
from 
the 
sovereign 
which 
does
not 
admit 
of 
the 
possibility 
of 
abandoning 
Moscow, 
and 
the 
commander 
in
chief's 
rival, 
the 
man 
who 
is 
undermining 
him 
(and 
there 
are 
always
not 
merely 
one 
but 
several 
such), 
presents 
a 
new 
project 
diametrically
opposed 
to 
that 
of 
turning 
to 
the 
Kaluga 
road, 
and 
the 
commander 
in
chief 
himself 
needs 
sleep 
and 
refreshment 
to 
maintain 
his 
energy 
and
a 
respectable 
general 
who 
has 
been 
overlooked 
in 
the 
distribution 
of
rewards 
comes 
to<p>
complain, 
and 
the 
inhabitants 
of 
the 
district 
pray 
to
be 
defended, 
and 
an 
officer 
sent 
to 
inspect 
the 
locality 
comes 
in 
and
gives 
a 
report 
quite 
contrary 
to 
what 
was 
said 
by 
the 
officer
previously 
sent; 
and 
a 
spy, 
a 
prisoner, 
and 
a 
general 
who 
has 
been
on 
reconnaissance, 
all 
describe 
the 
position 
of 
the 
enemy's 
army
differently. 
People 
accustomed 
to 
misunderstand 
or 
to 
forget 
these
inevitable
