laughing 
at 
his 
way 
of 
life) 
he 
himself 
joined<p>
in 
the
merriment.

"That's 
right, 
young 
countess, 
that's 
it, 
come 
on! 
I 
never 
saw
anyone 
like 
her!" 
said 
he, 
offering 
Nicholas 
a 
pipe 
with 
a 
long 
stem
and, 
with 
a 
practiced 
motion 
of 
three 
fingers, 
taking 
down 
another 
that
had 
been 
cut 
short. 
"She's 
ridden 
all 
day 
like 
a 
man, 
and 
is 
as
fresh 
as 
ever!"

Soon 
after 
"Uncle's" 
reappearance 
the 
door 
was 
opened, 
evidently
from 
the 
sound 
by 
a 
barefooted 
girl, 
and 
a 
stout, 
rosy, 
good-looking
woman 
of 
about 
forty, 
with 
a 
double 
chin 
and 
full 
red 
lips, 
entered
carrying 
a 
large 
loaded 
tray. 
With 
hospitable 
dignity 
and 
cordiality 
in
her 
glance 
and 
in 
every 
motion, 
she 
looked 
at 
the 
visitors 
and, 
with
a 
pleasant 
smile, 
bowed 
respectfully. 
In 
spite 
of 
her 
exceptional
stoutness, 
which 
caused 
her 
to 
protrude 
her 
chest 
and 
stomach 
and 
throw
back 
her 
head, 
this 
woman 
(who 
was 
"Uncle's" 
housekeeper) 
trod
very 
lightly. 
She 
went 
to 
the 
table, 
set 
down 
the 
tray, 
and 
with 
her
plump 
white 
hands 
deftly 
took 
from 
it 
the 
bottles 
and 
various 
hors
d'oeuvres 
and 
dishes 
and 
arranged 
them 
on 
the 
table. 
When 
she 
had
finished, 
she 
stepped 
aside 
and 
stopped 
at 
the 
door 
with 
a 
smile 
on 
her
face. 
"Here 
I 
am. 
I 
am 
she! 
Now 
do 
you 
understand 
'Uncle'?" 
her
expression 
said 
to 
Rostov. 
How 
could 
one 
help 
understanding? 
Not 
only
Nicholas, 
but 
even 
Natasha<p>
understood 
the 
meaning 
of 
his 
puckered 
brow
and 
the 
happy 
complacent 
smile 
that 
slightly 
puckered 
his 
lips 
when
Anisya 
Fedorovna 
entered. 
On 
the 
tray 
was 
a 
bottle 
of 
herb 
wine,
different 
kinds 
of 
vodka, 
pickled 
mushrooms, 
rye 
cakes 
made 
with
buttermilk, 
honey 
in 
the 
comb, 
still 
mead 
and 
sparkling 
mead, 
apples,
nuts 
(raw 
and 
roasted), 
and 
nut-and-honey 
sweets. 
Afterwards 
she 
brought
a 
freshly 
roasted 
chicken, 
ham, 
preserves 
made
