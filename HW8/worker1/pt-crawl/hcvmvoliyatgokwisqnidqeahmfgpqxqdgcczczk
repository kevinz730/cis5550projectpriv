a 
bird 
in</h1>his 
hands 
and 
flies 
away. 
And 
there's 
no 
way 
of 
killing 
him
either."

"You're 
a 
first-class 
liar, 
Kiselev, 
when 
<a href="/aVzUge/NJ7mbEd4UJpiB5.html">I</a> 
come 
to 
look 
at 
you!"

"Liar, 
indeed! 
It's 
the 
real 
truth."

"If 
he 
fell 
into 
my 
hands, 
when 
I'd 
caught 
him 
I'd 
bury 
him 
in 
the
ground 
with 
an 
aspen 
stake 
to 
fix 
him 
down. 
What 
a 
lot 
of 
men 
he's
ruined!"

"Well, 
anyhow 
we're 
going 
to 
end 
it. 
He 
won't 
come 
here 
again," 
remarked
the 
old 
soldier, 
yawning.

The 
conversation 
flagged, 
and 
the 
soldiers 
began 
settling 
down 
to 
sleep.

"Look 
at 
the 
stars. 
It's 
wonderful 
how 
they 
shine! 
You 
would 
think 
the
women 
had 
spread 
out 
their 
linen," 
said 
one 
of 
the 
men, 
gazing 
with
admiration 
at 
the 
Milky 
Way.

"That's 
a 
sign<p>
of 
a 
good 
harvest 
next 
year."

"We 
shall 
want 
some 
more 
wood."

"You 
warm 
your 
back 
and 
your 
belly 
gets 
frozen. 
That's 
queer."

"O 
Lord!"

"What 
are 
you 
pushing 
for? 
Is 
the 
fire 
only 
for 
you? 
Look 
how 
he's
sprawling!"

In 
the 
silence 
that 
ensued, 
the 
snoring 
of 
those 
who 
had 
fallen 
asleep
could 
be 
heard.
