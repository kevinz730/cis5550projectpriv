keyeteiebolsckugdmqcmawepmrqosvslkpkhiao length 4 4176 page 4176 <h1>the 
hussars</h1>to 
retreat 
with 
the 
infantry. 
They 
were 
cut 
off 
from
the 
line 
of 
retreat 
on 
the 
left 
by 
the 
French. 
However 
inconvenient 
the
position, 
it 
was 
now 
necessary 
to 
attack 
in 
order 
to 
cut 
a 
way 
through
for 
themselves.

The 
squadron 
in 
which 
Rostov 
was 
serving 
had 
scarcely 
time 
to 
mount
before 
it 
was 
halted 
facing 
the 
enemy. 
Again, 
as 
at 
the 
Enns 
bridge,
there 
was 
nothing 
between 
the 
squadron 
and 
the 
enemy, 
and 
again 
that
terrible 
dividing 
line 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
fear-resembling 
the 
line
separating 
the 
living 
from 
the 
dead-lay 
between 
them. 
All 
were
conscious 
of 
this 
unseen 
line, 
and 
the 
question 
whether 
they 
would 
cross
it 
or 
not, 
and 
how 
they 
would 
cross 
it, 
agitated 
them 
all.

The 
colonel 
rode 
to 
the 
front, 
angrily 
gave 
some 
reply 
to 
questions 
put
to 
him 
by 
the 
officers, 
and,<p>
like 
a 
man 
desperately 
insisting 
on 
having
his 
own 
way, 
gave 
an 
order.<p>
No 
one 
said 
anything 
definite, 
but 
the 
rumor
of 
an 
attack 
spread 
through 
the 
squadron. 
The 
command 
to 
form 
up 
rang
out 
and 
the 
sabers 
whizzed 
as 
they 
were 
drawn 
from 
their 
scabbards.
Still 
no 
one 
moved. 
The 
troops 
of 
the 
left 
flank, 
infantry 
and 
hussars
alike, 
felt 
that 
the 
commander 
did 
not 
himself 
know 
what 
to 
do, 
and 
this
irresolution 
communicated 
itself 
to 
the 
men.

"If 
only 
they 
would 
be 
quick!" 
thought 
Rostov, 
feeling 
that 
at 
last
the 
time 
had 
come 
to 
experience 
the 
joy 
of 
an 
attack 
of 
which<p>
he 
had 
so
often 
heard 
from 
his 
fellow 
hussars.

"Fo'ward, 
with 
God, 
lads!" 
rang 
out 
Denisov's 
voice. 
"At 
a
twot 
fo'ward!"

The 
horses' 
croups 
began 
to 
sway 
in 
the 
front 
line. 
Rook 
pulled 
at 
the
reins 
and 
started 
of 
his 
own 
accord.

Before 
him, 
on 
the 
right, 
Rostov 
saw 
the 
front 
lines 
of 
his 
hussars 
and
still 
farther 
ahead 
a 
dark 
line 
which 
he 
could 
not 
see 
distinctly 
but
took 
to 
be 
the 
enemy. 
Shots 
could 
be 
heard, 
but 
some 
way 
off.

"Faster!" 
came 
the 
word 
of 
command, 
and 
Rostov 
felt 
Rook's 
flanks
drooping 
as 
he 
broke 
into 
a 
gallop.

Rostov 
anticipated 
his 
horse's 
movements 
and 
became 
more 
and 
more
elated. 
He 
had<p>
noticed 
a 
solitary 
tree 
ahead 
of 
him. 
This 
tree 
had 
been
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
line 
that 
had 
seemed 
so 
terrible-and 
now 
he
had 
crossed 
that 
line 
and 
not 
only 
was 
there 
nothing 
terrible, 
but
everything 
was 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
happy 
and 
animated. 
"Oh, 
how 
I
will 
slash 
at 
him!" 
thought 
Rostov, 
gripping 
the 
hilt 
of 
his 
saber.

"Hur-a-a-a-ah!" 
came 
a 
roar 
of 
voices. 
"Let 
anyone 
come 
my 
way
now," 
thought 
Rostov 
driving 
his 
spurs 
into 
Rook 
and 
letting 
him 
go
at 
a 
full 
gallop 
so 
that 
he 
outstripped 
the 
others. 
Ahead, 
the 
enemy 
was
already 
visible. 
Suddenly 
something 
like 
a 
birch 
broom 
seemed 
to 
sweep
over 
the 
squadron. 
Rostov 
raised 
his 
saber, 
ready 
to 
strike,<p>
but 
at
that 
instant 
the 
trooper 
Nikitenko, 
who 
was 
galloping 
ahead, 
shot 
away
from 
him, 
and 
Rostov 
felt 
as 
in 
a 
dream 
that 
he 
continued 
to 
be 
carried
forward 
with 
unnatural 
speed 
but 
yet 
stayed 
on 
the 
same 
spot. 
From
behind 
him<p>
Bondarchuk, 
an 
hussar 
he 
knew, 
jolted 
against 
him 
and 
looked
angrily 
at 
him. 
Bondarchuk's 
horse 
swerved 
and 
galloped 
past.

"How 
is 
it 
I 
am 
not 
moving? 
I 
have 
fallen, 
I 
am 
killed!" 
Rostov
asked 
and 
answered 
at 
the 
same 
instant. 
He 
was 
alone 
in 
the 
middle 
of<p>
a
field. 
Instead 
of 
the 
moving 
horses 
and 
hussars' 
backs, 
he 
saw 
nothing
before 
him 
but 
the 
motionless 
earth 
and 
the 
stubble 
around<p>
him. 
There
was 
warm 
blood 
under 
his 
arm. 
"No, 
I 
am<p>
wounded 
and 
the 
horse 
is
killed." 
Rook 
tried 
to 
rise 
on 
his 
forelegs 
but 
fell 
back, 
pinning 
his
rider's 
leg. 
Blood 
was 
flowing 
from 
his 
head; 
he 
struggled 
but 
could
not 
rise.
