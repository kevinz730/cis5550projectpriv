mulled 
brandy,</h1>taken
a 
snack, 
and 
washed 
it 
down 
with 
half 
a 
bottle 
of 
his 
favorite 
Bordeaux.

He 
was 
somewhat 
flushed 
with 
the 
wine 
and 
the 
drive. 
His 
eyes 
were
rather 
moist 
and 
glittered 
more 
than 
usual, 
and 
as 
he 
sat 
in 
his 
saddle,
wrapped 
up 
in 
his 
fur 
coat, 
he 
looked 
like 
a 
child 
taken 
out 
for 
an
outing.

The 
thin, 
hollow-cheeked 
Chekmar, 
having 
got 
everything 
ready, 
kept
glancing 
at 
his 
master 
with 
whom 
he 
had 
lived 
on 
the 
best 
of 
terms 
for
thirty 
years, 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/SvD30gcnoA5Z.html">understanding</a> 
the 
mood 
he 
was 
in 
expected 
a 
pleasant
chat. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/JM10WMYlo2A.html">A</a> 
third 
person 
rode 
up 
circumspectly 
through 
the 
wood<p>
(it 
was
plain 
that 
he 
had 
had 
a 
lesson) 
and 
stopped 
behind 
the 
count. 
This
person 
was 
a 
gray-bearded 
old 
man 
in 
a 
woman's 
cloak, 
with 
a 
tall
peaked 
cap 
on 
his 
head. 
He 
was 
the 
buffoon, 
who 
went 
by 
a 
woman's
name, 
Nastasya 
Ivanovna.

"Well, 
Nastasya 
Ivanovna!" 
whispered 
the 
count, 
winking 
at 
him.
"If 
you 
scare 
away 
the 
beast, 
Daniel'll 
give 
it 
you!"

"I 
know 
a 
thing 
or 
two 
myself!" 
said 
Nastasya 
Ivanovna.

"Hush!" 
whispered 
the 
count<p>
and 
turned 
to 
Simon. 
"Have 
you 
seen
the 
young 
countess?" 
he 
asked. 
"Where 
is 
she?"

"With 
young 
Count 
Peter, 
by 
the 
Zharov 
rank 
grass," 
answered 
Simon,
smiling. 
<a href="/aVzUge/UN5meoou07KpkPN.html">"Though</a> 
she's 
a 
lady, 
she's 
very 
fond 
of 
hunting."

"And 
you're 
surprised 
at 
the 
way 
she 
rides, 
Simon, 
eh?" 
said 
the
count. 
"She's 
as 
good 
as 
many 
a 
man!"

"Of 
course! 
It's 
marvelous. 
So 
bold, 
so 
easy!"

"And 
Nicholas? 
Where 
is 
he? 
By 
the 
Lyadov 
upland, 
isn't 
he?"

"Yes, 
sir. 
He 
knows 
where 
to 
stand. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xa2t8Cv2U.html">He</a> 
understands 
the 
matter 
so 
well
that 
Daniel 
and 
I 
are 
often 
quite 
astounded," 
said 
Simon, 
well 
knowing
what 
would 
please 
his 
master.

"Rides 
well, 
eh? 
And 
how 
well 
he 
looks 
on 
his 
horse, 
eh?"

"A 
perfect 
picture! 
How 
he 
chased 
a 
fox 
out<p>
of 
the 
rank 
grass
