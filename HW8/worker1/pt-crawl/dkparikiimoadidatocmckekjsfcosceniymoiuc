and

by 
vanity 
and 
pettiness.

Finding 
himself 
in 
the 
company 
of 
Napoleon, 
whose 
identity 
he 
had 
easily
and 
surely 
recognized, 
Lavrushka 
was 
not 
in 
the 
least 
abashed 
but 
merely
did 
his 
utmost 
to 
gain 
his 
new 
master's 
favor.

He 
knew 
very 
well 
that 
this 
was 
Napoleon, 
but 
Napoleon's 
presence 
could
no 
more 
intimidate 
him 
than 
Rostov's, 
or 
a 
sergeant 
major's 
with 
the
rods, 
would 
have 
done, 
for 
he 
had 
nothing 
that 
either 
the 
sergeant 
major
or 
Napoleon 
could 
deprive 
him 
of.

So 
he 
rattled 
on, 
telling 
all 
the 
gossip 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EJ4KpkPN7d0P.html">he</a> 
had 
heard 
among 
the
orderlies. 
Much 
of 
it 
true. 
But 
when 
Napoleon 
asked 
him 
whether 
the
Russians 
thought 
they 
would 
beat 
Bonaparte 
or 
not, 
Lavrushka 
screwed 
up
his 
eyes 
and 
considered.

In 
this 
question 
he 
saw 
subtle 
cunning, 
as 
men 
of 
his 
type 
see 
cunning
in 
everything, 
so 
he 
frowned<p>
and 
did 
not 
answer 
immediately.

"It's 
like 
this," 
he 
said 
thoughtfully, 
"if 
there's 
a 
battle 
soon, 
yours
will 
win. 
That's 
right. 
But 
if 
three 
days 
pass, 
then 
after 
that, 
well,
then 
that 
same 
battle 
will 
not 
soon 
be 
over."

Lelorgne 
d'Ideville 
smilingly 
interpreted 
this 
speech 
to 
Napoleon 
thus:
"If 
a 
battle 
takes 
place 
within 
the 
next 
three 
days 
the 
French 
will
win, 
but 
if 
later, 
God 
knows 
what 
will 
happen." 
Napoleon 
did 
not 
smile,
though 
he 
was 
evidently 
in 
high 
good 
humor, 
and 
he 
ordered 
these 
words
to 
be 
repeated.

Lavrushka 
noticed 
this 
and 
to 
entertain 
him 
further, 
pretending 
not 
to
know 
who 
Napoleon 
was, 
added:

"We 
know 
that 
you 
have 
Bonaparte 
and 
that 
he 
has 
beaten 
everybody 
in 
the
world, 
but 
we 
are 
a 
different 
matter..."-without 
knowing 
why 
or 
how 
this
bit 
of 
boastful 
patriotism 
slipped 
out 
at 
the 
end.

The 
interpreter 
translated 
these 
words 
without 
the 
last 
phrase, 
and
Bonaparte 
smiled. 
"The 
young 
Cossack 
made 
his 
mighty 
interlocutor
smile," 
says 
Thiers. 
After 
riding 
a 
few 
paces 
in 
silence, 
Napoleon
turned 
to 
Berthier 
and 
said 
he 
wished 
to 
see 
how 
the 
news 
that 
he 
was
talking 
to 
the 
Emperor 
himself, 
to 
that 
very 
Emperor 
who 
had 
written 
his
immortally 
victorious 
name 
on 
the 
Pyramids, 
would 
affect 
this 
enfant 
du
Don. 
*

 
 
 
 
* 
"Child 
of 
the 
Don."


The 
fact 
was 
accordingly 
conveyed 
to 
Lavrushka.

Lavrushka, 
understanding 
that 
this 
was 
done 
to 
perplex 
him 
and 
that
Napoleon 
expected 
him 
to 
be 
frightened, 
to 
gratify<p>
his 
new 
masters
promptly 
pretended 
to 
be 
astonished 
and 
awe-struck, 
opened 
his 
eyes
wide, 
and 
assumed 
the 
expression 
he 
usually 
put 
on 
when 
taken 
to 
be
whipped. 
"As 
soon 
as 
Napoleon's 
interpreter 
had 
spoken," 
says 
Thiers,
"the 
Cossack, 
seized 
by 
amazement, 
did 
not 
utter 
another 
word, 
but 
rode
on, 
his 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
the 
conqueror 
whose 
fame 
had 
reached 
him 
across
the 
steppes 
of 
the 
East. 
All 
his 
loquacity 
was 
suddenly 
arrested 
and
replaced 
by 
a 
naive 
and 
silent 
feeling 
of 
admiration. 
Napoleon, 
after
making 
the 
Cossack 
a 
present, 
had 
him 
set 
free 
like 
a 
bird 
restored 
to
its 
native
