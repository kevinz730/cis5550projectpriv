unnecessary 
retreat 
along
a</h1>devastated 
road-is 
explained 
<a href="/aVzUge/zl36Jk9rP.html">to</a> 
us 
as 
being 
due 
to 
profound
considerations. 
Similarly 
profound 
considerations 
are 
given 
for
his 
retreat 
from 
Smolensk 
to 
Orsha. 
Then 
his 
heroism 
at 
Krasnoe 
is
described, 
where 
he 
is 
reported 
to 
have 
been 
prepared 
to 
accept 
battle
and 
take 
personal 
command, 
and 
to 
have 
walked 
about 
with 
a 
birch 
stick
and 
said:

"J'ai 
assez 
fait 
l'empereur; 
il 
est 
temps 
de 
faire 
le 
general," 
<a href="/cZl/Zdn31xHdu.html">*</a> 
but
nevertheless 
immediately 
ran 
away 
again, 
abandoning 
to 
its 
fate 
the
scattered 
fragments 
of 
the 
army<p>
he 
left 
behind.

 
 
 
 
 
* 
"I 
have<p>
acted 
the 
Emperor 
long 
enough; 
it 
is 
time 
to 
act
 
 
 
 
 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hI3tc2BnCGW3iLv.html">the</a> 
general."


Then 
we 
are 
told 
of 
the 
greatness 
of 
soul 
of 
the 
marshals, 
especially
of 
Ney-a 
greatness 
of 
soul 
consisting 
in 
this: 
that 
he 
made 
his 
way 
by
night 
around 
through 
the 
forest 
and 
across 
the 
Dnieper 
and 
escaped 
to
Orsha, 
abandoning 
standards, 
artillery, 
and 
nine 
tenths 
of 
his 
men.

And 
lastly, 
the 
final 
departure 
of 
the 
great 
Emperor 
from 
his 
heroic
army 
is 
presented 
to 
us 
by 
the 
historians 
as 
something 
great 
and
characteristic 
of 
genius. 
Even 
that 
final 
running 
away, 
described 
in
ordinary 
language 
as 
the 
lowest 
depth 
of 
baseness 
which 
every 
child
is 
taught 
to 
be 
ashamed 
of-even 
that 
act 
finds 
justification 
in 
the
historians' 
language.

When 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
stretch 
the 
very 
elastic 
threads 
of 
historical
ratiocination 
any 
farther, 
when 
actions 
are 
clearly 
contrary 
to 
all
that 
humanity 
calls 
right 
or 
even 
just, 
the 
historians 
produce 
a 
saving
conception 
of 
"greatness." 
"Greatness," 
it 
seems, 
excludes 
the 
standards
of 
right 
and 
wrong. 
For 
the 
"great" 
man 
nothing 
is 
wrong, 
there 
is 
no
atrocity 
for 
which 
a 
"great" 
man 
can 
be 
blamed.

"C'est 
grand!" 
* 
say 
the 
historians, 
and 
there 
no 
longer 
exists 
either
good 
or 
evil 
but 
only 
"grand" 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UJ1pbE40b.html">and</a> 
"not 
grand." 
Grand 
is 
good, 
not
grand 
is 
bad. 
Grand 
is 
the 
characteristic, 
in 
their 
conception, 
of 
some
special 
animals 
called 
"heroes." 
And 
Napoleon, 
escaping 
home 
in 
a 
warm
fur 
coat 
and 
leaving 
to 
perish 
those 
who 
were 
not 
merely 
his 
comrades
but 
were<p>
(in 
his 
opinion) 
men 
he 
had 
brought 
there, 
feels 
que 
c'est
grand, 
*(2) 
and 
his 
soul 
is 
tranquil.

 
 
 
<p>
 
* 
"It 
is 
great."

 
 
 
 
 
* 
(2) 
That 
it 
is 
great.

"Du 
sublime 
(he 
saw 
something 
sublime 
in 
himself)<p>
au 
ridicule 
il 
n'y
a 
qu'un 
pas," 
* 
said 
he. 
And 
the 
whole 
world 
for 
fifty 
years 
has 
been
repeating: 
"Sublime! 
Grand! 
Napoleon 
le 
Grand!" 
Du 
sublime 
au 
ridicule
il<p>
n'y 
a 
qu'un 
pas.

 
 
 
 
* 
"From 
the 
sublime 
to 
the 
ridiculous 
is 
but 
a 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/DL7oP5PEuF0fnq.html">step."


And</a> 
it 
occurs 
to 
no 
one 
that 
to 
admit 
a 
greatness 
not 
commensurable 
with
the 
standard 
of 
right 
and 
wrong 
is 
merely 
to 
admit 
one's 
own 
nothingness
and 
immeasurable 
meanness.
