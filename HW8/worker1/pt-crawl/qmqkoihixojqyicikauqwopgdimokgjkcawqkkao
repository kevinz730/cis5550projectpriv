"Now 
then, 
now 
then!" 
said 
she.

"Mamma, 
can 
we 
have 
a 
talk? 
Yes?" 
said 
Natasha. 
"Now, 
just 
one 
on
your 
throat 
and 
another... 
that'll 
do!" 
And 
seizing 
her 
mother 
round
the 
neck, 
she 
kissed 
her 
on 
the 
throat. 
In 
her<p>
behavior 
to 
her 
mother
Natasha 
seemed 
rough, 
but 
she 
was 
so 
sensitive 
and 
tactful 
that 
however
she 
clasped 
her 
mother 
she 
always 
managed 
to 
do 
it 
without 
hurting 
her
or 
making 
her 
feel 
uncomfortable 
or 
displeased.

"Well,<p>
what 
is 
it 
tonight?" 
said 
the 
mother, 
having 
arranged 
her
pillows 
and 
waited 
until 
Natasha, 
after 
turning 
over 
a 
couple 
of 
times,
had 
settled 
down 
beside 
her 
under<p>
the 
quilt, 
spread 
out 
her 
arms, 
and
assumed 
a 
serious 
expression.

These 
visits 
of 
Natasha's 
at 
night 
before 
the 
count 
returned 
from 
his
club 
were 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
pleasures 
of 
both 
mother, 
and 
daughter.

"What 
is 
it 
tonight?-But 
I 
have 
to 
tell 
you..."

Natasha 
put 
her 
hand 
on 
her 
mother's 
mouth.

"About 
Boris... 
I 
know," 
she 
said 
seriously; 
"that's 
what 
I
have 
come 
about. 
Don't 
say 
it-I 
know. 
No, 
do 
tell
