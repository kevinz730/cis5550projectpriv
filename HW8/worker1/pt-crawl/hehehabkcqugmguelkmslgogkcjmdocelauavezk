Kutuzov</h1>was
saying 
to 
a 
general 
who 
stood 
beside 
him, 
not 
taking 
his 
eye<p>
from 
the
battlefield.

Having 
received 
this 
order 
the 
general 
passed 
by 
Pierre 
<a href="/cZl/qK5mM4pXQvm.html">on</a> 
his 
way 
down
the 
knoll.

"To 
the 
crossing!" 
said 
the 
general 
coldly 
and 
sternly 
in 
reply 
to 
one
of 
the 
staff 
who 
asked 
where 
he 
was 
going.

"I'll 
go 
there 
too, 
I 
too!" 
thought 
Pierre, 
and 
followed 
the 
general.

The 
general 
mounted 
a 
horse 
a 
Cossack 
had 
brought 
him. 
Pierre 
went 
to
his 
groom 
who 
was 
holding 
his 
horses 
and, 
asking 
which 
was 
the 
quietest,
clambered 
onto 
it, 
seized 
it 
by 
the 
mane, 
and 
turning 
out 
his 
toes
pressed 
his 
heels 
against 
its 
sides 
and, 
feeling 
that 
his 
spectacles
were 
slipping 
off 
but 
unable 
to 
let 
go 
of 
the 
mane 
and 
reins, 
he
galloped 
after 
the 
general, 
causing 
the 
staff 
officers 
to 
smile 
as 
they
watched 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EV6GCnw.html">him</a> 
from 
the 
knoll.





CHAPTER 
XXXI

Having 
descended<p>
the 
hill 
the 
general 
after 
whom 
Pierre 
was 
galloping
turned 
sharply 
to 
the 
left, 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/uFR4NuySF7U7.html">Pierre,</a> 
losing 
sight 
of 
him, 
galloped
in 
among 
some 
ranks 
of 
infantry 
marching 
<a href="/aVzUge/xr1N9P2.html">ahead</a> 
of 
him. 
He 
tried 
to 
pass
either 
in 
front 
of 
them 
or 
to 
the 
right 
or 
left, 
but 
there 
were 
soldiers
everywhere, 
all 
with 
the 
same 
preoccupied 
expression 
and 
busy 
with
some 
unseen 
but 
evidently 
important 
task. 
They 
all 
gazed 
with 
the 
same
dissatisfied 
and 
inquiring 
expression 
at 
this 
stout 
man 
in 
a 
white 
hat,
who 
for 
some 
unknown 
reason 
threatened 
to 
trample 
them 
under 
his 
horse's
hoofs.
