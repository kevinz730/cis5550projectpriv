only 
looked 
up 
with<p>
a 
smile 
that 
said 
reproachfully: 
"How
can 
you 
ask 
such 
a 
question?"

"I 
have 
never 
enjoyed 
myself 
so 
much 
before!" 
she 
said, 
and 
Prince
Andrew 
noticed 
how 
her 
thin 
arms 
rose 
quickly 
as 
if 
to 
embrace 
her
father 
and 
instantly 
dropped 
again. 
Natasha 
was 
happier 
than 
she 
had
ever 
been 
in 
her 
life. 
She 
was 
at 
that 
height 
of 
bliss 
when 
one 
becomes
completely 
kind 
and 
good 
and 
does 
not 
believe 
in 
the 
possibility 
of
evil, 
unhappiness, 
or 
sorrow.

At 
that 
ball 
<a href="/aVzUge/dK66vtfU3J.html">Pierre</a> 
for 
the 
first 
time 
felt 
humiliated 
by 
the 
position
his 
wife 
<a href="/cZl/ywm6OHGoa72ZNkA.html">occupied</a> 
in 
court 
circles. 
He 
was 
gloomy 
and 
absent-minded. 
A
deep 
furrow 
ran 
across 
his 
forehead, 
and 
standing 
by 
a 
window 
he 
stared
over 
his 
spectacles 
seeing 
no 
one.

On 
her 
way 
to 
supper 
Natasha 
passed 
him.

Pierre's 
gloomy, 
unhappy 
look 
struck 
her. 
She 
stopped 
in 
front 
of 
him.
She 
wished 
to 
help 
him, 
to 
bestow 
on 
him 
the 
superabundance 
of 
her 
own
happiness.

"How 
delightful 
it 
is, 
Count!" 
said 
she. 
"Isn't 
it?"

Pierre 
smiled 
absent-mindedly, 
evidently 
not 
grasping 
what 
she 
said.

"Yes, 
I 
am 
very 
glad," 
<a href="/aVzUge/WJ8VwPy16QtfEB.html">he</a> 
said.

"How 
can 
people 
be 
dissatisfied 
with 
anything?" 
thought 
Natasha.
"Especially 
such 
a 
capital 
fellow 
as 
Bezukhov!" 
In 
Natasha's
eyes 
all 
the 
people 
at 
the 
ball 
alike 
were 
good, 
kind, 
and 
splendid
people, 
loving 
one 
another; 
none 
of 
them 
capable 
of 
injuring
another-and 
so 
they 
ought 
all 
to 
be 
happy.





CHAPTER 
XVIII

Next 
day 
Prince 
Andrew 
thought 
of 
the 
ball, 
but 
his 
mind 
did 
not 
dwell
on 
it 
long. 
"Yes, 
it 
was 
a 
very 
brilliant 
ball," 
and 
then... 
"Yes,
that 
little 
Rostova 
is 
very 
charming. 
There's 
something 
fresh,
original,
