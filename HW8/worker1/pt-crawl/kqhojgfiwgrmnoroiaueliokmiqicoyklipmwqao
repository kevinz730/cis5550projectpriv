"Only, 
please 
let<p>
me 
command</h1>something, 
so 
that 
I 
may 
really 
command..."
Petya 
went 
on. 
"What 
would 
it 
be 
to 
you?... 
Oh,<p>
you 
want 
a 
knife?" 
he
said, 
turning 
to 
an 
officer 
who 
wished 
to 
cut 
himself 
a 
piece 
of 
mutton.

And 
he 
handed 
him 
his 
clasp 
knife. 
The 
officer 
admired 
it.

"Please 
keep 
it. 
I 
have 
several 
like 
it," 
said 
Petya, 
blushing.
"Heavens! 
I 
was 
quite 
forgetting!" 
he 
suddenly 
cried. 
"I 
have 
some
raisins, 
fine 
ones; 
you 
know, 
seedless 
ones. 
We 
have 
a 
new 
sutler<p>
and
he 
has 
such 
capital 
things. 
I 
bought 
ten 
pounds. 
I 
am 
used 
to 
something
sweet. 
Would 
you 
like 
some?..." 
and 
Petya 
ran 
out 
into 
the 
passage 
to
his 
Cossack 
and 
brought 
back 
some 
bags 
which 
contained 
about 
five 
pounds
of 
raisins. 
"Have 
some, 
gentlemen, 
have 
some!"

"You 
want 
a 
coffeepot, 
don't 
you?" 
he 
asked 
the 
esaul. 
"I 
bought 
a
capital 
one 
from 
our 
sutler!<p>
He 
has 
splendid 
things. 
And 
he's 
very
honest, 
that's 
the 
chief 
thing. 
I'll 
be 
sure 
to 
send 
it 
to 
you. 
Or
perhaps 
your 
flints 
are 
giving 
out, 
or 
are 
worn 
out-that 
happens
sometimes, 
you 
know. 
I 
have 
brought 
some 
with 
me, 
here 
they 
are"-and 
he
showed 
a 
bag-"a 
hundred 
flints. 
I 
bought 
them 
very 
cheap. 
Please 
take 
as
many 
as 
you 
want, 
or 
all 
if 
you 
like...."

Then 
suddenly, 
dismayed 
lest 
he 
had 
said 
too 
much, 
Petya 
stopped 
and
blushed.

He 
tried 
to 
remember 
whether 
he 
had 
not 
done 
anything 
else 
that 
was
foolish. 
And 
running 
over 
the 
events 
of 
the 
day 
he 
remembered 
the 
French
drummer 
boy. 
"It's 
capital 
for 
us 
here, 
but 
what 
of 
him? 
Where 
have 
they
put 
him? 
Have 
they 
fed 
him? 
Haven't 
they 
hurt 
his 
feelings?" 
he 
thought.
But 
having 
caught 
himself 
saying 
too 
much 
about 
the 
flints, 
he 
was 
now
afraid 
to 
speak 
out.

"I 
might 
ask," 
he 
thought, 
"but 
they'll 
say: 
'He's 
a 
boy 
himself<p>
and 
so
he 
pities 
the 
boy.' 
I'll 
show 
them 
tomorrow 
whether 
I'm 
a 
boy. 
Will 
it
seem 
odd 
if 
I 
ask?" 
Petya 
thought. 
"Well, 
never 
mind!" 
and 
immediately,
blushing 
and 
looking 
anxiously 
at 
the 
officers 
to 
see 
if 
they 
appeared
ironical, 
he 
said:

"May 
I 
call 
in 
that 
boy 
who 
was 
taken 
prisoner 
and 
give 
him 
something 
to
eat?... 
Perhaps..."

"Yes, 
he's 
a 
poor 
little 
fellow," 
said 
Denisov, 
who 
evidently 
saw
nothing 
shameful 
in 
this 
reminder. 
"Call 
him 
in. 
His 
name 
is 
Vincent
Bosse. 
Have 
him 
fetched."

"I'll 
call 
him," 
said 
Petya.

"Yes, 
yes, 
call<p>
him. 
A 
poor 
little 
fellow," 
Denisov 
repeated.

Petya 
was 
standing 
at 
the 
door 
when 
Denisov 
said 
this. 
He 
slipped 
in
between 
the 
officers, 
came 
close 
to 
Denisov, 
and 
said:

"Let 
me 
kiss 
you, 
dear 
old 
fellow! 
Oh, 
how 
fine, 
how 
splendid!"

And 
having 
kissed 
Denisov 
he 
ran 
out 
of 
the 
hut.

"Bosse! 
Vincent!" 
Petya 
cried, 
stopping 
outside 
the 
door.

"Who 
do 
you 
want, 
sir?" 
asked 
a 
voice 
in 
the 
darkness.

Petya 
replied 
that 
he 
wanted 
the 
French 
lad 
who 
had 
been 
captured 
that
day.

"Ah, 
Vesenny?" 
said 
a 
Cossack.

Vincent, 
the 
boy's 
name, 
had 
already 
been 
changed 
by 
the 
Cossacks 
into
Vesenny 
(vernal) 
and 
into 
Vesenya 
by 
the 
peasants 
and 
soldiers. 
In 
both
these 
adaptations 
the 
reference 
to 
spring 
(vesna) 
matched 
the 
impression
made 
by 
the 
young 
lad.

"He 
is 
warming 
himself 
there 
by 
the 
bonfire. 
Ho, 
Vesenya!
Vesenya!-Vesenny!" 
laughing 
voices 
were 
heard 
calling 
to<p>
one 
another 
in
the 
darkness.

"He's 
a 
smart 
lad," 
said 
an 
hussar 
standing 
near 
Petya. 
"We 
gave 
him
something 
to 
eat 
a 
while 
ago. 
He 
was 
awfully 
hungry!"

The 
sound 
of 
bare 
feet 
splashing 
through 
the 
mud<p>
was 
heard 
in 
the
darkness, 
and 
the 
drummer 
boy 
came 
to 
the 
door.

"Ah, 
c'est 
vous!" 
said 
Petya. 
"Voulez-vous 
manger? 
N'ayez 
pas 
peur, 
on
ne 
vous 
fera 
pas 
de 
mal,"

and 
affectionately,
