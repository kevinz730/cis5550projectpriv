despairing 
wail 
and<p>
a 
tender 
murmur,

that

This 
reading,
as 
was 
always 
the 
case 
at 
Anna 
Pavlovna's 
soirees, 
had 
a 
political
significance. 
That 
evening 
she 
expected 
several 
important 
personages 
who
had 
to 
be 
made 
ashamed 
of 
their 
visits 
to 
the 
French 
theater 
and 
aroused
to 
a 
patriotic 
temper. 
A 
good 
many 
people 
had 
already 
arrived, 
but 
Anna
Pavlovna,<p>
not 
yet 
seeing 
all 
those 
whom 
she 
wanted 
in 
her 
drawing 
room,
did 
not 
let 
the 
reading 
begin 
but 
wound 
up 
the 
springs 
of 
a 
general
conversation.

The 
news 
of 
the 
day 
in 
Petersburg 
was 
the 
illness 
of 
Countess 
Bezukhova.
She 
had 
fallen 
ill 
unexpectedly 
a 
few 
days 
previously, 
had 
missed
several 
gatherings 
of 
which 
she 
was 
usually 
the 
ornament, 
and 
was 
said
to 
be 
receiving 
no 
one, 
and 
instead 
of 
the 
celebrated 
Petersburg 
doctors
who 
usually 
attended 
her 
had 
entrusted 
herself 
to 
some<p>
Italian 
doctor
who 
was 
treating 
her 
in 
some 
new 
and 
unusual 
way.

They 
all 
knew 
very 
well 
that 
the 
enchanting 
countess' 
illness 
arose 
from
an 
inconvenience 
resulting 
from 
marrying 
two 
husbands 
at 
the 
same 
time,
and 
that 
the 
Italian's 
cure 
consisted 
in 
removing 
such 
inconvenience;
but 
in 
Anna 
Pavlovna's 
presence 
no 
one 
dared 
to 
think 
of 
this 
or 
even
appear 
to 
know 
it.

"They 
say 
the 
poor 
countess 
is 
very 
ill. 
The 
doctor 
says 
it 
is 
angina
pectoris."

"Angina? 
Oh, 
that's 
a 
terrible 
illness!"

"They 
say 
that 
the 
rivals 
are 
reconciled, 
thanks 
to 
the 
angina..." 
and
the 
word 
angina 
was 
repeated 
with 
great 
satisfaction.

"The 
count 
is 
pathetic, 
they 
say. 
He 
cried 
like 
a 
child 
when 
the 
doctor
told 
him 
the 
case 
was 
dangerous."

"Oh, 
it 
would 
be<p>
a 
terrible 
loss, 
she 
is 
an 
enchanting 
woman."

"You 
are 
speaking 
of 
the 
poor 
countess?" 
said 
Anna 
Pavlovna, 
coming
up 
just 
then. 
"I 
sent 
to 
ask 
for 
news, 
and 
hear 
that 
she 
is 
a 
little
better. 
Oh, 
she 
is 
certainly 
the 
most 
charming 
woman 
in 
the 
world," 
she
went 
on, 
with 
a 
smile 
at 
her 
own 
enthusiasm. 
"We 
belong 
to 
different
camps, 
but 
that 
does 
not 
prevent 
my 
esteeming 
her 
as 
she 
deserves. 
She
is 
very 
unfortunate!" 
added 
Anna 
Pavlovna.

Supposing 
that 
by 
these 
words 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
was 
somewhat 
lifting 
the
veil 
from 
the 
secret 
of 
the 
countess' 
malady,<p>
an 
unwary 
young 
man
ventured 
to 
express 
surprise 
that 
well-known 
doctors 
had 
not 
been 
called
in 
and 
that 
the 
countess 
was 
being 
attended 
by 
a 
charlatan 
who 
might
employ 
dangerous 
remedies.

"Your 
information 
may 
be 
better 
than 
mine," 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
suddenly 
and
venomously 
retorted 
on 
the 
inexperienced 
young 
man, 
"but 
I 
know 
on 
good
authority 
that 
this 
doctor 
is 
a 
very 
learned 
and 
able 
man. 
He 
is 
private
physician 
to 
the 
Queen 
of 
Spain."

And 
having 
thus 
demolished 
the 
young 
man, 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
turned 
to
another 
group 
where 
Bilibin 
was 
talking 
about 
the 
Austrians: 
having
wrinkled 
up 
his 
face 
he 
was 
evidently 
preparing 
to<p>
smooth 
it 
out 
again
and 
utter 
one 
of 
his 
mots.

"I 
think 
it 
is 
delightful," 
he 
said, 
referring 
to 
a 
diplomatic 
note 
that
had 
been
