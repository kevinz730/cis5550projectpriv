remounts, 
but</h1>that 
letter 
did 
not 
set 
the 
countess 
at 
ease. 
Knowing 
that
one 
son 
was 
out 
of 
danger 
she 
became 
the 
more 
anxious 
about 
Petya.

Though 
by 
the 
twentieth 
of 
August 
nearly 
all 
the 
Rostovs' 
acquaintances
had 
left 
Moscow, 
and 
though 
everybody 
tried 
to 
persuade 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tE7ieWTn13oC.html">the</a> 
countess 
to
get 
away 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible, 
she 
would 
not 
hear 
of 
leaving 
before
her 
treasure, 
her<p>
adored 
Petya, 
returned. 
On 
the 
twenty-eighth 
of 
August
he 
arrived. 
The 
passionate 
tenderness 
with 
which 
his 
mother 
received 
him
did 
not 
please 
the 
sixteen-year-old 
officer. 
Though 
she 
concealed 
from
him 
her 
intention 
of 
keeping 
him<p>
under 
her 
wing, 
Petya 
guessed 
her
designs, 
and 
instinctively 
fearing 
that 
he 
might 
give 
way 
to 
emotion
when 
with<p>
her-might 
"become 
womanish" 
as 
he 
termed 
it 
to 
himself-he
treated 
her 
coldly, 
avoided 
her, 
and 
during 
his 
stay 
in 
Moscow 
attached
himself 
exclusively 
to 
Natasha 
for 
whom 
he 
had 
always 
had 
a 
particularly
brotherly 
tenderness, 
almost 
lover-like.

Owing 
to 
the 
count's 
customary 
carelessness 
nothing 
was 
ready 
for 
their
departure 
by 
the 
twenty-eighth 
of 
August 
and 
the 
carts 
that 
were 
to
come 
from 
their 
Ryazan 
and 
Moscow 
estates 
to 
remove 
their 
household
belongings 
did 
not 
arrive 
till 
the 
thirtieth.

From 
the 
twenty-eighth 
till 
the 
thirty-first 
all 
Moscow 
was 
in<p>
a 
bustle
and 
commotion. 
Every 
day 
thousands 
of 
men 
wounded 
at 
Borodino 
were
brought 
in 
by 
the 
Dorogomilov 
gate 
and 
taken 
to 
various 
parts 
of 
Moscow,
and 
thousands 
of 
carts 
conveyed 
the 
inhabitants 
and 
their 
possessions
out 
by 
the 
other 
gates. 
In 
spite 
of 
Rostopchin's 
<a href="/cZl/IE2S0T.html">broadsheets,</a> 
<a href="/aVzUge/iw8N8xt8Nw.html">or</a> 
because
of 
them 
or 
independently 
of 
them, 
the 
strangest 
and 
most 
contradictory
rumors 
were 
current 
in 
the 
town. 
Some 
said 
that 
no 
one 
was 
to 
be 
allowed
to 
leave 
the 
city, 
others 
on 
the 
contrary 
said 
that 
all 
the 
icons 
had
been 
taken 
out 
of 
the 
churches 
and 
everybody 
was 
to 
be 
ordered 
to 
leave.
Some 
said 
there 
had 
been 
another 
battle 
after 
Borodino 
at 
which 
the
French 
had 
been 
routed, 
while 
others 
on 
the 
contrary 
reported 
that 
the
Russian 
army 
had 
been 
destroyed. 
<a href="/aVzUge/bfW6Gj0w8.html">Some</a> 
talked 
about 
the 
Moscow 
militia
which, 
preceded 
by 
the 
clergy, 
would 
go 
to 
the 
Three 
Hills; 
others
whispered 
that 
Augustin 
had 
been 
forbidden 
to 
leave, 
that 
traitors 
had
been 
seized, 
that 
the 
peasants 
were 
rioting 
and 
robbing 
people 
on 
their
way 
from 
Moscow, 
and 
so 
on. 
But 
all 
this 
was 
only 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Wj6ohMq99Ix.html">talk;</a> 
in 
reality
(though 
the 
Council 
of 
Fili, 
at 
which 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
abandon 
Moscow,
had 
not 
yet 
been 
held) 
both 
those 
who 
went 
away 
and 
those 
who 
remained
behind 
felt, 
though 
they 
did 
not 
show 
it, 
that 
Moscow 
would 
certainly
be 
abandoned, 
and 
that 
they 
ought<p>
to 
get 
away
