As 
he 
was 
being 
led 
up 
to 
<a href="/aVzUge/Wk68gle0TkvQH.html">some</a> 
object 
he 
noticed 
a
hesitation 
and 
uncertainty 
among 
his 
conductors. 
He 
heard 
those 
around
him 
disputing 
in 
whispers 
and 
one 
of 
them 
insisting 
that 
<a href="/cZl/mkp3zmeD9CpNdk6.html">he</a> 
should 
be
led 
along 
a 
certain

fidelity

the 
laws 
of 
the 
Order. 
The 
candles 
were 
then
extinguished 
and 
some 
spirit 
lighted, 
as 
Pierre 
knew 
by 
the 
smell, 
and
he 
was

that 
he 
would

see 
the 
lesser 
light.

bandage

saw 
several 
men 
standing 
before 
him, 
wearing
aprons
