himssggqfgiglewkkspsdebeuceargsoaqiqsefg length 4 3825 page 3825 <h1>had 
a 
dim 
perception 
of</h1>the
following 
budget:

About 
80,000 
went 
in 
payments 
on 
all 
the 
estates 
to 
the 
Land 
Bank, 
about
30,000 
went 
for 
the 
upkeep 
of 
the 
estate 
near 
Moscow, 
the 
town 
house,
and 
the 
allowance 
to 
the 
three 
princesses; 
about 
15,000 
was 
given 
in
pensions 
and 
the 
same 
amount 
for 
asylums; 
150,000 
alimony 
was 
sent 
to
the<p>
countess; 
about 
70,000 
went 
for 
interest 
on 
debts. 
The 
building 
of 
a
new 
church, 
previously 
begun, 
had 
cost 
about 
10,000 
in 
each 
of 
the 
last
two 
years, 
and 
he 
did 
not 
know 
how 
the 
rest, 
about 
100,000 
rubles, 
was
spent, 
and 
almost 
every 
year 
he 
was 
obliged 
to 
borrow. 
Besides 
this 
the
chief 
steward 
wrote 
every 
year 
telling 
him 
of 
fires 
and 
bad 
harvests,
or 
of 
the 
necessity 
<a href="/aVzUge/WC6zmeD7cYy0.html">of</a> 
rebuilding 
factories 
and 
workshops. 
So 
the 
first
task 
Pierre 
had 
to 
face 
was 
one 
for 
which 
he 
had 
very 
little 
aptitude 
or
inclination-practical 
business.

He 
discussed 
estate 
affairs 
every 
day 
with 
his 
chief 
steward. 
But
he 
felt 
that 
this 
did 
not 
forward 
matters 
at 
all. 
He 
felt 
that 
these
consultations 
were 
detached<p>
from 
real 
affairs 
and 
did 
not 
link 
up 
with
them 
or 
make 
them 
move. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
chief 
steward 
put 
the 
state
of 
things 
to 
him 
in 
the 
very 
worst 
light, 
pointing 
out 
the 
necessity 
of
paying 
off 
the 
debts 
and 
undertaking 
new 
activities 
with 
serf 
labor,
to 
which 
Pierre 
did 
not 
agree. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
Pierre 
demanded 
that
steps 
should 
be 
taken 
to 
liberate 
the 
serfs, 
which 
the 
steward 
met 
by
showing 
the 
necessity 
of 
first 
paying 
off 
the 
loans 
from 
the 
Land 
Bank,
and 
the 
consequent 
impossibility 
of 
a 
speedy 
emancipation.

The 
steward 
did 
not 
say 
it 
was<p>
quite 
impossible, 
<a href="/cZl/kQ69HPeSU6XZWkd.html">but</a> 
suggested 
selling
the 
forests 
in 
the 
province 
of 
Kostroma, 
the 
land 
lower 
down 
the 
river,
and 
the 
Crimean 
estate, 
in 
order 
to 
make 
it 
possible: 
all 
of 
which
operations 
according 
to 
him 
were 
connected 
with 
<a href="/cZl/JV5GaVr3hxx6Cv.html">such</a> 
<a href="/cZl/WM2bOIDr5ZUI3HI.html">complicated
measures-the</a> 
removal 
of 
injunctions, 
petitions, 
permits, 
and 
so
on-that 
Pierre 
became 
quite 
bewildered 
and 
only 
replied:

"Yes, 
yes, 
do 
so."

Pierre 
had 
none 
of 
the 
practical 
persistence 
that 
would 
have 
enabled 
him
to 
attend 
to 
the 
business 
himself 
and 
so 
he 
disliked 
it 
and 
only 
tried
to 
pretend 
to 
the 
steward 
that 
he 
was 
attending 
to 
it. 
The 
steward
for 
his 
part 
tried 
to 
pretend 
to 
the 
count 
that 
he 
considered 
these
consultations 
very 
valuable 
for 
the 
proprietor 
and 
troublesome 
to
himself.

In 
Kiev 
Pierre 
found 
some 
people 
he 
knew, 
and 
strangers 
hastened 
to 
make
his 
acquaintance 
and 
joyfully 
welcomed 
the 
rich 
newcomer, 
the
largest 
landowner 
of 
the 
province. 
Temptations 
to 
Pierre's 
greatest
weakness-the 
one 
to 
which 
he 
had 
confessed 
when 
admitted 
to 
the
Lodge-were 
so 
strong 
that 
he 
could 
not 
resist 
them. 
Again 
whole 
days,
weeks, 
and 
months 
of 
his 
life 
passed 
in 
as 
great 
a 
rush 
and 
were 
as 
much
occupied 
with 
evening 
parties, 
dinners, 
lunches, 
and 
<a href="/cZl/nHL70tvJE6nrOP.html">balls,</a> 
giving 
him
no 
time 
for 
reflection, 
as 
in 
Petersburg. 
Instead 
of 
the 
new 
life 
he 
had
hoped 
to 
lead 
he 
still 
lived 
the 
old 
life, 
only 
in 
new 
surroundings.

Of 
the 
three 
precepts 
of 
Freemasonry 
Pierre 
realized 
that 
he 
did 
not
fulfill 
the 
one 
which 
enjoined 
every 
Mason 
to 
set
