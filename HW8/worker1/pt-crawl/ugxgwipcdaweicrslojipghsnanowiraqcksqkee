of 
excellent, 
simple,
and 
kindly 
people. 
The 
old 
count's 
hospitality 
and 
good 
nature, 
which
struck 
one 
especially 
in 
Petersburg 
as 
a 
pleasant 
surprise, 
were 
such
that 
Prince 
Andrew 
could 
not<p>
refuse 
to 
stay 
to 
dinner. 
"Yes,"
he 
thought, 
"they 
are 
capital 
people, 
who 
of 
course 
have 
not 
the
slightest 
idea 
what 
a 
treasure 
they<p>
possess 
in 
Natasha; 
but 
they 
are
kindly 
folk 
and 
form 
<a href="/cZl/ZV2ieWTn42LcEl.html">the</a> 
best 
possible 
setting 
for 
this 
strikingly
poetic, 
charming 
girl, 
overflowing 
with 
life!"

In 
Natasha 
Prince 
Andrew 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tB2EI1ML6S.html">was</a> 
conscious 
of 
a 
strange 
world 
completely
alien 
to 
him 
and 
brimful 
of 
joys 
unknown 
to 
him, 
a 
different 
world,
that 
in 
the 
Otradnoe 
avenue 
and<p>
at 
the 
window 
that 
moonlight 
night
had 
already 
begun 
to 
disconcert 
him. 
Now 
this 
world 
disconcerted 
him 
no
longer 
and 
was 
no 
longer 
alien 
to<p>
him, 
but 
he 
himself 
having 
entered 
it
found 
in 
it 
a 
new 
enjoyment.

After 
dinner 
Natasha, 
at 
Prince 
Andrew's 
request, 
went 
<a href="/aVzUge/td26W1kQqNG.html">to</a> 
the
clavichord 
and 
began 
singing. 
Prince 
Andrew 
stood 
by 
a 
window 
talking
to 
the 
ladies 
and 
listened 
to 
her. 
In 
the 
midst 
of 
a 
phrase 
he 
ceased
speaking 
and 
suddenly 
felt 
tears 
choking 
him, 
a 
thing 
he 
had 
thought
impossible 
for 
him. 
He 
looked 
at 
Natasha 
as 
she 
sang, 
and 
something 
new
and 
joyful 
stirred 
in 
his 
soul. 
He 
felt 
happy 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
sad.
He 
had 
absolutely 
nothing 
to 
weep 
about 
yet 
he 
was 
ready 
to 
weep. 
What
about? 
His 
former 
love? 
The 
little 
princess? 
His 
disillusionments?...
His 
hopes 
for 
the 
future?... 
Yes 
and 
no. 
The 
chief 
reason 
was 
a 
sudden,
vivid 
sense 
of 
the 
terrible 
contrast 
between 
something 
infinitely 
great
and 
illimitable 
within 
him 
and 
that 
limited 
and 
material 
something 
that
he, 
and 
even 
she, 
was. 
This 
contrast 
weighed 
on 
and 
yet 
cheered 
him
while 
she 
sang.

soon 
as
