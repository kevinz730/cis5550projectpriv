ten," 
came 
the 
countess' 
voice.

"Directly! 
Directly! 
And 
you,<p>
Mamma?"

"I 
have 
only 
my 
cap 
to 
pin 
on."

"Don't 
do 
it 
without 
me!" 
<a href="/aVzUge/SDF43ezc3JedQ.html">called</a> 
Natasha. 
"You 
won't 
do 
<a href="/cZl/Ix423w.html">it
right."

"But</a> 
it's 
already 
ten."

They 
had 
decided 
to 
be 
at 
the 
ball 
by 
half-past 
ten, 
and 
Natasha 
had
still 
to<p>
get 
dressed 
and 
they 
had 
to 
call 
at 
the 
Taurida 
Gardens.

When 
her 
hair 
was 
done, 
Natasha, 
in 
her 
short 
petticoat 
from 
under
which 
her 
dancing 
shoes 
showed, 
and 
in 
her 
mother's 
dressing 
jacket,
ran 
up 
to 
Sonya, 
scrutinized 
her, 
and 
then 
ran 
to 
<a href="/cZl/Gb4w0Cr6rJpLp.html">her</a> 
mother. 
Turning
her 
mother's 
head 
this 
way 
and 
that, 
she 
fastened 
on 
the 
cap 
and,
hurriedly 
kissing 
her 
gray 
hair, 
ran 
back<p>
to 
the 
maids 
who<p>
were 
turning
up 
the 
hem 
of 
her 
skirt.

The 
cause 
of 
the 
delay 
was 
Natasha's 
skirt, 
which 
was 
too 
long.
Two 
maids 
were 
turning 
up 
the 
hem 
and 
hurriedly 
biting 
off 
the 
ends 
of
thread. 
A 
third 
with 
pins 
in 
her 
mouth 
was 
running 
about 
between 
the
countess 
and 
Sonya, 
and 
a 
fourth 
held 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
gossamer 
garment
up 
high 
on 
one 
uplifted 
hand.

"Mavra, 
quicker, 
darling!"

"Give 
me 
my 
thimble, 
Miss, 
<a href="/cZl/hZ1xHdu5sVlKw3ywmuR.html">from</a> 
there..."

"Whenever 
will 
you 
be 
ready?" 
asked 
the 
count 
coming 
to 
the 
door.
"Here 
is 
some 
scent. 
Peronskaya 
must 
be 
tired 
of 
waiting."

"It's 
ready, 
Miss," 
said 
the 
maid, 
holding 
up 
the 
shortened 
gauze
dress 
with 
two 
fingers, 
and 
blowing 
and 
shaking 
something 
off 
it, 
as 
if
by 
this 
to 
express 
a 
consciousness 
of 
the 
airiness 
and 
purity 
of 
what
she 
held.

Natasha 
began 
putting 
on 
the 
dress.

"In 
a 
minute! 
In 
a 
minute! 
Don't 
come 
in, 
Papa!" 
she 
cried 
to 
her
father 
as 
he 
opened 
the 
door-speaking 
from 
under 
the 
filmy 
skirt 
which
still 
covered 
her 
whole 
face.

Sonya 
slammed 
the 
door 
to. 
<a href="/aVzUge/qB7Pe8AJH6.html">A</a> 
minute 
later 
they 
let 
the 
count 
in. 
He 
was
wearing 
a 
blue 
swallow-tail 
coat, 
shoes 
and 
stockings, 
and 
was 
perfumed
and 
his 
hair 
pomaded.

"Oh, 
Papa! 
how 
nice 
you 
look! 
Charming!" 
cried 
Natasha, 
as 
she
stood 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room 
smoothing 
out 
the 
folds 
of 
the 
gauze.

"If 
you 
please, 
Miss! 
allow 
me," 
said 
the 
maid, 
who 
on 
her 
knees 
was
pulling 
the 
skirt 
straight 
and 
shifting 
the 
pins 
from 
one 
side 
of 
her
mouth 
to 
the 
other 
with 
her 
tongue.

"Say 
what 
you 
like," 
exclaimed 
Sonya, 
in 
a 
despairing 
voice 
as 
she
looked 
at 
Natasha, 
"say 
what 
you 
like, 
it's 
still 
too 
long."

Natasha 
stepped 
back 
to 
look 
at 
herself 
in 
the 
pier 
glass. 
The 
dress
was 
too 
long.

"Really, 
madam, 
it 
is 
not 
at 
all 
too 
long," 
said 
Mavra, 
crawling 
on
her 
knees 
after 
her 
young 
lady.

"Well,<p>
if 
it's 
too 
long 
we'll 
tack 
it 
up... 
we'll 
tack 
it 
up
in 
one 
minute," 
said 
the 
resolute 
Dunyasha 
taking 
a 
needle 
that 
was
stuck 
on 
the 
front 
of 
her 
little 
shawl 
and, 
still 
kneeling 
on 
the 
floor,
set 
to 
work 
once 
more.

At 
that 
moment, 
with 
soft 
steps, 
the 
countess 
came 
in 
shyly, 
in 
her 
cap
and 
velvet 
gown.

"Oo-oo, 
my 
beauty!" 
exclaimed 
the 
count, 
"she 
looks 
better 
than
any 
of 
you!"

He 
would 
have 
embraced 
her 
but, 
blushing, 
she 
stepped 
aside 
fearing 
to
be 
rumpled.

"Mamma, 
your 
cap,
