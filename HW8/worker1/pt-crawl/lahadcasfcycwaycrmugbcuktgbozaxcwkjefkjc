not

but 
did 
not 
consider
it 
necessary 
to 
introduce 
himself, 
and 
without 
experiencing 
the 
least
embarrassment 
looked 
Pierre 
straight 
in 
the 
face.

"Count 
Rostov 
asks 
you 
to 
come 
to 
dinner 
today," 
said 
he, 
after 
a
considerable<p>
pause 
which 
made 
Pierre 
feel 
uncomfortable.

"Ah, 
Count 
Rostov!" 
exclaimed 
Pierre 
joyfully. 
"Then 
you 
are 
his
son, 
Ilya? 
Only 
fancy, 
I 
didn't 
know 
you 
at 
first. 
Do 
you 
remember
how 
we 
went 
to 
the 
Sparrow 
Hills 
with 
Madame 
Jacquot?... 
It's 
such 
an
age..."

"You 
are 
mistaken," 
said 
Boris 
deliberately, 
with 
a 
bold 
and
slightly 
sarcastic 
smile. 
"I 
am 
Boris, 
son 
of 
Princess 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
Drubetskaya. 
Rostov, 
the 
father, 
is 
Ilya, 
and 
his 
son 
is
Nicholas. 
I 
never 
knew 
any 
Madame 
Jacquot."

Pierre 
shook 
his 
head 
and 
arms 
as 
if 
attacked 
by 
mosquitoes 
or 
bees.

"Oh 
dear, 
what 
am 
I 
thinking 
about? 
I've 
mixed 
everything 
up. 
One
has 
so 
many 
relatives 
in 
Moscow! 
So 
you 
are 
Boris? 
Of 
course. 
Well, 
now
we 
know 
where 
we 
are. 
And 
what 
do 
you 
think 
of 
the 
Boulogne 
expedition?
The 
English 
will 
come 
off 
badly, 
you 
know, 
if 
Napoleon 
gets 
across 
the
Channel. 
I 
think 
the 
expedition 
is 
quite 
feasible. 
If 
only 
Villeneuve
doesn't 
make 
a 
mess 
of 
things!"

Boris 
knew 
nothing 
about 
the 
Boulogne 
expedition; 
he 
did 
not 
read 
the
papers 
and 
it 
was 
the 
first 
time 
he<p>
had 
heard 
Villeneuve's 
name.

"We 
here 
in 
Moscow 
are 
more 
occupied<p>
with 
dinner 
parties 
and 
scandal
than 
with 
politics," 
said 
he 
in 
his 
quiet 
ironical 
tone. 
"I 
know
nothing 
about 
it 
and 
have 
not 
thought 
about 
it. 
Moscow 
is 
chiefly 
busy
with 
gossip," 
he 
continued. 
"Just 
now 
they 
are 
talking 
about 
you 
and
your 
father."

Pierre 
smiled 
in 
his 
good-natured 
way 
as 
if 
afraid 
for 
his 
companion's
sake 
that 
the 
latter 
might 
say 
something 
he 
would 
afterwards 
regret.
But 
Boris 
spoke 
distinctly, 
clearly, 
and 
dryly, 
looking 
straight 
into
Pierre's 
eyes.

"Moscow 
has 
nothing 
else 
to 
do 
but 
gossip," 
Boris 
went 
on.
"Everybody 
is 
wondering 
to 
whom 
the 
count 
will 
leave 
his 
fortune,
though 
he 
may 
perhaps 
outlive 
us 
all, 
as 
I 
sincerely<p>
hope 
he 
will..."

"Yes, 
it 
is 
all 
very 
horrid," 
interrupted 
Pierre, 
"very 
horrid."

Pierre 
was 
still 
afraid 
that 
this 
officer 
might 
inadvertently 
say
something 
disconcerting 
to 
himself.

"And 
it 
must 
seem 
to 
you," 
said 
Boris 
flushing 
slightly, 
but 
not
changing 
his 
tone 
or 
attitude, 
"it 
must 
seem 
to 
you 
that 
everyone 
is
trying 
to 
get 
something 
out 
of 
the 
rich 
man?"

"So 
it 
does," 
thought
