aunt</h1>without 
waiting 
to 
hear 
her 
speech 
about 
Her 
Majesty's 
health.
Anna 
Pavlovna 
in 
dismay 
detained 
him 
with 
the 
words: 
"Do 
you 
know 
the
Abbe 
Morio? 
He 
is 
a 
most 
<a href="/cZl/fF5sfA8Exs4l.html">interesting</a> 
man."

"Yes, 
I 
have 
heard 
of 
<a href="/aVzUge/dl9GdRBS1jct6hZVi.html">his</a> 
scheme 
for 
perpetual 
peace, 
and 
it 
is 
very
interesting 
but 
hardly 
feasible."

"You 
think 
so?" 
rejoined 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
in 
order 
to 
say 
something
and 
get 
away 
to 
attend 
to 
her 
duties 
as 
hostess. 
But 
Pierre 
now
committed 
a 
reverse 
act 
of 
impoliteness. 
First 
he 
had 
left 
a 
lady 
before
she 
had 
finished 
speaking 
to 
him, 
and 
now 
he 
<a href="/cZl/jl6NPl04.html">continued</a> 
to 
speak 
to
another 
who 
wished 
to 
get 
away. 
With 
his 
<a href="/nocrawl/c8Rhi6R/Crl64tEu3mJ.html">head</a> 
bent, 
and 
his 
big 
feet
spread 
apart, 
he 
began 
explaining 
his 
reasons 
for 
thinking 
the 
abbe's
plan 
chimerical.

"We 
will 
talk 
of 
it 
later," 
said 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
with 
a 
smile.

And 
having 
got 
rid 
of 
this 
young 
man 
who 
did 
not 
know 
how 
to 
behave, 
she
resumed 
her 
duties 
as 
hostess 
and 
continued 
to 
listen 
and 
watch, 
ready
to 
help 
at 
any 
point 
where 
the 
conversation 
might 
happen 
to 
flag. 
As
the 
foreman 
of 
a 
spinning 
mill, 
when 
he 
has 
set 
the 
hands 
to 
work, 
goes
round 
and 
notices 
here 
a 
spindle 
that 
has 
stopped 
or 
there 
one 
that
creaks 
or 
makes 
more 
noise 
than<p>
