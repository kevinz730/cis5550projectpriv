talked, 
and
kissed 
him 
at 
the 
same 
time. 
Only 
his 
mother 
was 
not 
there, 
he 
noticed
that.

"And 
I 
did 
not 
know... 
Nicholas... 
My 
darling!..."

"Here 
he 
is... 
our 
own... 
Kolya, 
* 
dear 
fellow... 
How 
he 
has
changed!... 
Where 
are 
the 
candles?... 
Tea!..."

 
 
<p>
 
* 
Nicholas.

"And 
me, 
kiss 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oz9U6ntIh8.html">me!"

"Dearest...</a> 
and 
me!"

Sonya, 
Natasha, 
Petya, 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
Vera, 
and 
the 
old 
count
were 
all 
hugging 
him, 
and 
the 
serfs,<p>
men 
and 
maids, 
flocked 
into 
the
room, 
exclaiming 
and 
oh-ing 
and 
ah-ing.

Petya, 
clinging 
to 
his 
legs, 
kept 
shouting, 
"And 
me 
too!"

Natasha, 
after 
she 
had 
pulled 
him 
down 
toward 
<a href="/cZl/ZM9U3.html">her</a> 
and 
covered 
his 
face
with 
kisses, 
holding 
him 
tight 
by 
the 
skirt 
of 
his 
coat, 
sprang 
away 
and
pranced 
up<p>
and 
down 
in 
one 
place 
like 
a 
goat 
and 
shrieked 
piercingly.

All 
around 
were 
loving 
eyes 
glistening 
with 
tears 
of 
joy, 
and 
all 
around
were 
lips 
seeking 
a 
kiss.

Sonya 
too, 
all 
rosy 
red, 
clung 
to 
his 
arm 
and, 
radiant 
with 
bliss,
looked 
eagerly 
toward 
his 
eyes, 
waiting 
for 
the 
look 
for 
which 
she
longed. 
Sonya 
now 
was 
sixteen<p>
and 
she 
was 
very 
pretty, 
especially 
at
this 
moment 
of 
happy, 
rapturous 
excitement. 
<a href="/cZl/Ro3iY4ka4eyxg.html">She</a> 
gazed 
at 
him, 
not 
taking
her 
eyes 
off 
him, 
and 
smiling 
and 
holding 
her 
breath. 
He 
gave 
her 
a
grateful 
look, 
but 
was 
still 
expectant 
and 
looking 
for 
someone. 
The 
old
countess 
had 
not 
yet 
come. 
But 
now 
steps 
were 
heard 
at 
the 
door, 
steps
so 
rapid 
that 
they 
could 
hardly 
be 
his 
mother's.

Yet 
it 
was 
she, 
dressed 
in 
a 
new 
gown 
which 
he 
did 
not 
know, 
made 
since
he 
had 
left. 
All 
the 
others 
let 
him 
go, 
and 
he 
ran 
to 
her. 
<a href="/cZl/jM2QD1ZS4jM.html">When</a> 
they
met, 
she 
fell 
on 
his 
breast, 
sobbing. 
She 
could 
not 
lift 
her 
face, 
but
only 
pressed 
it 
to 
the 
cold 
braiding 
of 
his 
hussar's 
jacket. 
Denisov,
who 
had 
come 
into 
the 
room 
unnoticed 
by 
anyone, 
stood 
there 
and 
wiped
his 
eyes 
at 
the 
sight.

"Vasili 
Denisov, 
your 
son's 
friend," 
he 
said, 
introducing
himself 
to 
the 
count, 
who 
was 
looking 
inquiringly 
at 
him.

"You 
are 
most 
welcome! 
I 
know, 
I 
know," 
said 
the 
count, 
kissing
