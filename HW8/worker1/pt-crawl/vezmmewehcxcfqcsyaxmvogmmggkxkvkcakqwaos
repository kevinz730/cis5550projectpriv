I</h1>held 
the 
enemy 
at 
bay 
for 
thirty-five 
hours 
and 
beat 
him; 
but 
he
would 
not 
hold 
out 
even 
for 
fourteen 
hours. 
It 
is 
disgraceful, 
a 
stain
on 
our 
army, 
and 
as 
for 
him, 
he 
ought, 
it 
seems 
to 
me, 
not 
to 
live. 
If
he 
reports 
that 
our 
losses 
were 
great, 
it 
is 
not 
true; 
perhaps 
about
four 
thousand, 
not 
more, 
and 
not 
even 
that; 
but 
even 
were 
they 
ten
thousand, 
that's 
war! 
But 
the 
enemy 
has 
lost 
masses....

What 
would 
it 
have 
cost 
him 
to 
hold 
out 
for 
another 
two 
days? 
They 
would
have 
had 
to 
retire 
of 
their 
own 
accord, 
for 
they 
had 
no 
water 
for 
men
or 
horses. 
He 
gave 
me 
his 
word 
he 
would 
not 
retreat, 
but 
suddenly 
sent
instructions 
that 
he 
was 
retiring 
that 
night. 
We 
cannot 
fight 
in 
this
way, 
or 
we 
may 
soon 
bring 
the 
enemy 
to 
Moscow....

There 
is 
a 
rumor 
that 
you 
are 
thinking 
of 
peace. 
God 
forbid 
that 
you
should 
make 
peace 
after 
all 
our 
sacrifices 
and 
such 
insane 
retreats! 
You
would 
set 
all 
Russia 
against 
you 
and 
everyone 
of 
us 
would 
feel 
ashamed
to 
wear 
the 
uniform. 
If 
it 
has 
come 
to 
this-we 
must 
fight 
as 
long 
as
Russia 
can 
and 
as 
long 
as 
there 
are 
men 
able 
to 
stand....

One 
man 
ought 
to 
be 
in 
command, 
and 
not 
two. 
Your 
Minister 
may 
perhaps
be 
good 
as 
a 
Minister, 
but 
as 
a 
general 
he 
is 
not 
merely 
bad 
but
execrable, 
yet 
to 
him 
is 
entrusted 
the 
fate 
of 
our<p>
whole 
country.... 
I
am 
really 
frantic 
with 
vexation; 
forgive 
my 
writing 
boldly. 
It 
is 
clear
that 
the 
man 
who 
advocates 
the 
conclusion 
of 
a 
peace, 
and 
that 
the
Minister 
should 
command 
the 
army, 
does 
not 
love 
our 
sovereign 
and
desires 
the 
ruin 
of 
us 
all.<p>
So 
I 
write 
you 
frankly: 
call 
out 
the
militia. 
For 
the 
Minister 
is 
leading 
these 
visitors 
after 
him 
to 
Moscow
in 
a 
most 
masterly 
way. 
The 
whole 
army 
feels 
great 
suspicion 
of 
the
Imperial 
aide-de-camp 
Wolzogen. 
He 
is 
said 
to 
be 
more 
Napoleon's 
man
than 
ours, 
and 
he 
is 
always 
advising 
the 
Minister. 
I 
am 
not 
merely 
civil
to 
him 
but 
obey 
him 
like 
a 
corporal, 
though 
I 
am 
his 
senior. 
This 
is
painful, 
but, 
loving 
my 
benefactor 
and 
sovereign, 
I 
submit. 
Only 
I 
am
sorry 
for 
the 
Emperor 
that 
he 
entrusts 
our 
fine 
army 
to 
such 
as 
he.
Consider 
that 
on 
our 
retreat 
we 
have 
lost 
by 
fatigue 
and 
left 
in 
the
hospital 
more 
than 
fifteen 
thousand 
men, 
and 
had 
we 
attacked 
this 
would
not 
have 
happened. 
Tell 
me, 
for 
God's 
sake, 
what 
will 
Russia, 
our 
mother
Russia, 
say 
to 
our 
being 
so 
frightened, 
and 
why 
are 
we 
abandoning 
our
good 
and 
gallant<p>
Fatherland 
to 
such 
rabble 
and 
implanting 
feelings 
of
hatred 
and 
shame 
in 
all 
our 
subjects? 
What 
are 
we 
scared 
at 
and 
of 
whom
are 
we 
afraid? 
I 
am 
not 
to 
blame 
that 
the 
Minister 
is 
vacillating,
a 
coward, 
dense, 
dilatory, 
and 
has 
all 
bad 
qualities. 
The 
whole 
army
bewails 
it 
and 
calls 
down 
curses 
upon 
him....

Among</a> 
the 
innumerable 
categories 
applicable 
to 
the 
phenomena 
of 
human
life 
one 
may 
discriminate 
between 
those 
in 
which 
substance 
prevails
and 
those 
in 
which 
form 
prevails. 
To 
the 
latter-as 
distinguished
from

may 
allot
Petersburg 
life, 
and 
especially 
the 
life 
of 
its 
salons. 
That 
life 
of
the 
salons 
is 
unchanging. 
Since 
the

1805 
we 
had 
made 
peace

had

with 
Bonaparte

again,
