night, 
and</h1>half 
the 
inhabitants 
had 
left 
the 
city
with 
Rostopchin's 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mW4DduKC83.html">own</a> 
permission. 
Yet 
all 
the 
same 
this 
information
astonished 
and 
irritated 
the 
count, 
coming 
as 
it<p>
did 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a
simple 
note 
with 
an 
order 
from 
Kutuzov, 
and 
received 
at 
night, 
breaking
in 
on 
his 
beauty 
sleep.

When 
later 
on 
in 
his 
memoirs 
Count 
Rostopchin 
explained 
his 
actions 
at
this 
time, 
he 
repeatedly 
says 
that 
he 
was 
then 
actuated 
by 
two 
important
considerations: 
to 
maintain 
tranquillity 
in 
Moscow 
and 
expedite 
the
departure 
of 
the 
inhabitants.<p>
If 
one 
accepts 
this 
twofold 
aim 
all
Rostopchin's 
actions 
appear 
irreproachable. 
"Why 
were 
the 
holy 
relics,
the 
arms, 
ammunition, 
gunpowder, 
and 
stores 
of 
corn 
not 
removed? 
Why
were 
thousands 
of 
inhabitants 
deceived 
into 
believing 
that 
Moscow 
would
not 
be 
given 
up-and 
thereby 
ruined?" 
"To 
preserve 
the 
tranquillity
of 
the 
city," 
explains 
Count 
Rostopchin. 
"Why 
were 
bundles 
of 
useless
papers 
from 
the 
government 
offices, 
and 
Leppich's 
balloon 
and 
other
articles 
removed?" 
"To 
leave 
the 
town 
empty," 
explains 
Count 
Rostopchin.
One 
need 
only 
admit 
that 
public 
tranquillity 
is 
in 
danger 
and 
any 
action
finds 
a 
justification.

All 
the 
horrors 
of 
the 
reign 
of 
terror 
were 
based 
only 
on 
solicitude 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oh2to5lFuWA.html">for
public</a> 
tranquillity.

On 
what, 
then, 
was 
Count 
Rostopchin's 
fear 
for 
the 
tranquillity<p>
of
Moscow 
based 
in 
1812? 
What 
reason 
was 
there 
for 
assuming 
any 
probability
of 
an 
uprising 
in 
the 
city? 
The 
inhabitants 
were 
leaving 
it 
and 
the
retreating 
troops 
were 
filling 
it. 
Why 
should 
that 
cause 
the 
masses 
to
riot?

Neither 
in 
Moscow 
nor 
anywhere 
in 
Russia 
did 
anything 
resembling 
an
insurrection 
ever 
occur 
when<p>
the 
enemy 
entered 
a 
town. 
More 
than
ten 
thousand 
people 
were 
still 
in 
Moscow 
on 
the 
first 
and 
second 
of
September, 
and 
except 
for 
a 
mob 
in 
the 
governor's 
courtyard, 
assembled
there 
at 
his 
bidding, 
nothing 
happened.<p>
It<p>
is 
obvious 
that 
there 
would
have 
been 
even 
less 
reason 
to 
expect 
a 
disturbance 
among 
the 
people
if 
after 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino, 
when 
the 
surrender 
of 
Moscow 
became
certain 
or 
at 
least 
probable, 
Rostopchin 
instead 
of 
exciting 
the 
people
by 
distributing 
arms 
and 
broadsheets 
had 
taken 
steps 
to 
remove 
all
the 
holy 
relics, 
the 
gunpowder, 
munitions, 
and 
money, 
and 
had 
told 
the
population 
plainly 
that 
the 
town 
would 
be 
abandoned.

Rostopchin, 
though 
he 
had 
patriotic 
sentiments,<p>
was 
a 
sanguine 
and
impulsive 
man 
who 
had 
always 
moved 
in 
the 
highest 
administrative 
circles
and 
had 
no 
understanding 
at 
all 
of 
the<p>
people 
he 
supposed 
himself 
to
be 
guiding. 
Ever 
since 
the 
enemy's<p>
entry 
into 
Smolensk 
he 
had 
in
imagination 
been 
playing 
the 
role<p>
of 
director 
of 
the 
popular 
feeling
of 
"the 
heart 
of 
Russia." 
Not 
only 
did 
it 
seem 
to 
him 
(as 
to 
all
administrators) 
that 
he 
controlled 
the 
external 
actions 
of 
Moscow's
inhabitants, 
but 
he 
also 
thought 
he 
controlled 
their 
mental 
attitude 
by
means 
of 
his 
broadsheets 
and 
posters, 
written 
in 
a 
coarse 
tone 
which 
the
people 
despise 
in 
their 
own 
class 
and 
do 
not 
understand<p>
from 
those 
in
authority. 
Rostopchin 
was 
so 
pleased 
with 
the 
fine 
role 
of 
leader
