his 
center, 
he 
himself 
might 
be 
killed 
by 
a 
stray
cannon 
ball. 
All 
this 
was 
possible. 
In 
former 
battles 
he 
had 
only
considered 
the 
possibilities 
of 
success, 
but 
now 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ks6HPeSU4O0qQI.html">innumerable</a> 
unlucky
chances 
presented 
themselves, 
and 
he 
expected 
them 
all. 
Yes, 
it 
was 
like
a 
dream 
in 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vbc4Scb0vYhkV0iY.html">which</a> 
a 
man 
fancies 
that 
a 
ruffian 
is 
coming 
to 
attack 
him,
and 
raises 
his 
arm<p>
to 
strike 
that 
ruffian 
a 
terrible 
blow 
which 
he 
knows
should<p>
annihilate 
him, 
but 
then 
feels 
that 
his 
arm 
drops 
powerless 
and
limp 
like 
a 
rag, 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UB3e1Gbiq7hBn.html">the</a> 
horror 
of 
unavoidable 
destruction 
seizes 
him 
in
his 
helplessness.

The 
news 
that 
the 
Russians 
were 
attacking 
the 
left 
flank 
of 
the 
French
army 
aroused<p>
that 
horror 
in 
Napoleon. 
He 
sat 
silently 
on 
a 
campstool
below 
the 
knoll, 
with 
head 
bowed 
and 
elbows 
on 
his 
knees. 
Berthier
approached 
and 
suggested 
that 
they 
should 
ride 
along 
the 
line 
to
ascertain 
the 
position 
of 
affairs.

"What? 
What 
do 
you 
say?" 
asked 
Napoleon. 
"Yes, 
tell 
them 
to 
bring 
me 
my
horse."

He 
mounted 
and 
rode 
toward 
Semenovsk.

Amid 
the 
powder 
smoke, 
slowly 
dispersing 
over 
the 
whole 
space 
through
which 
Napoleon 
rode, 
horses 
and 
men 
were 
lying 
in 
pools 
of 
blood, 
singly
or 
in 
heaps. 
Neither 
Napoleon 
nor 
any 
of 
his 
generals 
had 
ever 
before
seen 
such 
horrors 
or 
so 
many 
slain 
in 
such 
a 
small 
area. 
The 
roar 
of
guns, 
that 
had 
not 
ceased 
for 
ten 
hours, 
wearied 
the 
ear 
and 
gave
a 
peculiar 
significance 
<a href="/aVzUge/jo8UVJhk1G5oSU.html">to</a> 
the 
spectacle, 
as 
music 
does 
to 
tableaux
vivants. 
Napoleon 
rode 
up 
the 
high 
ground 
at 
Semenovsk, 
and 
through 
the
smoke 
saw 
ranks 
of 
men 
in 
uniforms 
of 
a 
color 
<a href="/cZl/dG51mk.html">unfamiliar</a> 
to 
him. 
They
were 
Russians.

The<p>
Russians 
stood 
in 
serried 
ranks 
behind 
Semenovsk 
village 
and 
its
knoll, 
and 
their 
guns 
boomed 
incessantly 
along 
their 
line 
and 
sent
forth 
clouds 
of 
smoke. 
It 
was 
no 
longer 
a 
battle: 
it 
was 
a 
continuous
slaughter 
which 
could 
be 
of 
no 
avail 
either 
to 
the 
French 
or 
the
Russians. 
Napoleon 
stopped 
his 
horse 
and 
again 
fell 
into 
the 
reverie
from 
which 
Berthier 
had 
aroused 
him. 
He 
could 
not 
stop 
what 
was 
going 
on
before 
him 
and 
around 
him 
and 
was 
supposed 
to<p>
be 
directed 
by 
him 
and 
to
depend 
on 
him, 
and 
from 
its 
lack 
of 
success 
this 
affair, 
for 
the 
first
time, 
seemed 
to 
him 
unnecessary 
and 
horrible.

One 
of 
the 
generals 
rode 
up 
to 
Napoleon 
and 
ventured 
to 
offer 
to 
lead
the 
Old 
Guard 
into 
action. 
Ney 
and 
Berthier, 
standing 
near 
Napoleon,
exchanged 
looks 
and 
smiled 
contemptuously 
at 
this 
general's 
senseless
offer.

Napoleon 
bowed 
his 
head 
and 
remained 
silent 
a 
long 
time.

"At 
eight 
hundred 
leagues 
from 
France, 
I 
will 
not 
have 
my 
Guard
destroyed!" 
he 
said, 
and 
turning 
his 
horse 
rode 
back 
to 
Shevardino.
