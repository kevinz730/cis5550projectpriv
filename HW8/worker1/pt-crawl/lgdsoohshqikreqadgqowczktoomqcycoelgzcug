opened
his 
eyes 
he 
heard</h1>in 
front 
of 
him, 
where 
the 
enemy 
was, 
the 
long-drawn
shouts 
of 
thousands 
of 
voices. 
His 
horse 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/JB3oqw19kK.html">the</a> 
horse 
of 
the 
hussar
near 
him 
pricked 
their 
ears 
at 
these 
shouts. 
Over 
there, 
where 
the
shouting 
came 
from, 
a 
fire 
flared 
up 
and 
went 
out 
again, 
then 
another,
and 
all 
along 
the 
French 
line 
on 
the 
hill 
fires 
flared 
up 
and 
the
shouting 
grew 
louder 
and 
louder. 
Rostov 
could 
hear 
the 
sound 
of 
French
words 
but 
could 
<a href="/cZl/mT2R8XKBx3.html">not</a> 
distinguish 
them. 
The 
din 
of 
many 
voices 
was 
too
great; 
all 
he 
could 
hear 
was: 
"ahahah!" 
and 
"rrrr!"

"What's 
that? 
What 
do 
you 
make 
of 
it?" 
said 
Rostov 
to 
the 
hussar
beside 
him. 
"That 
must 
be 
the 
enemy's 
camp!"

The 
hussar 
did 
not 
reply.

"Why, 
don't 
you 
hear 
it?" 
Rostov 
asked 
again, 
after 
waiting 
for 
a
reply.

"Who 
can 
tell, 
your 
honor?" 
replied 
the 
hussar 
reluctantly.

"From 
the 
direction, 
it 
must 
be 
the 
enemy," 
repeated 
Rostov.

"It 
may 
be 
he 
or 
it 
may 
be 
nothing," 
muttered 
the 
hussar. 
"It's
dark... 
Steady!" 
he 
cried 
to 
his 
fidgeting 
horse.

Rostov's 
horse 
was 
also 
getting 
restive: 
it 
pawed 
the 
frozen 
ground,
pricking 
its 
ears 
at 
the 
noise 
and 
looking 
at 
the 
lights. 
The 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/byy9iOfK5a.html">shouting
grew</a> 
still 
louder 
and 
merged 
into 
a 
general 
roar 
that 
only 
an 
army
of 
several 
thousand 
men 
could<p>
produce. 
The 
lights 
spread 
farther 
and
farther, 
probably 
along 
the 
line 
of 
the 
French 
camp. 
Rostov 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rz63KSVyY0ws.html">no</a> 
longer
wanted 
to 
sleep. 
The 
gay 
triumphant 
shouting 
of 
the 
enemy 
army 
had 
a
stimulating 
effect 
on 
him. 
"Vive 
l'Empereur! 
l'Empereur!" 
he 
now
heard 
distinctly.

"They 
can't 
be 
far 
off, 
probably 
just 
beyond 
the 
stream," 
he 
said
to 
the 
hussar 
beside 
him.

The 
hussar 
only 
sighed 
without 
replying 
and 
coughed 
angrily. 
The 
sound
of 
horse's 
hoofs 
approaching 
at 
a 
trot 
along 
the 
line 
of 
hussars 
was
heard, 
and 
out 
of 
the 
foggy 
darkness 
the 
figure 
of 
a 
sergeant 
of 
hussars
suddenly 
appeared, 
looming 
huge 
as 
an 
elephant.

"Your 
honor, 
the 
generals!" 
said 
the 
sergeant, 
riding 
up 
to 
Rostov.

Rostov,
