and 
essential</h1>significance 
of 
the 
European 
events 
of 
the
beginning 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
lies 
in 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
mass 
of
the 
European 
peoples 
from 
west 
to 
east 
and 
afterwards 
from 
east 
to 
west.
The 
commencement 
of 
that 
movement 
was 
the 
movement 
from 
west 
to 
east.
For 
the 
peoples 
of 
the 
west 
to 
be 
able 
to 
make 
their 
warlike 
movement
to<p>
Moscow 
it 
was 
necessary: 
(1) 
that 
they 
should 
form 
themselves 
into
a 
military 
group 
of 
a 
size 
able 
to 
endure 
a 
collision 
with 
the 
warlike
military 
group 
of 
the 
east, 
(2) 
that 
they 
should 
abandon 
all 
established
traditions 
and 
customs, 
and 
(3) 
that 
during 
their 
military 
movement 
they
should 
have 
at 
their 
head 
a 
man 
who 
could 
justify 
to 
himself 
and 
to 
them
the 
deceptions, 
robberies, 
and 
murders 
which 
would 
have 
to 
be 
committed
during 
that 
movement.

And 
beginning 
with 
the 
French 
Revolution 
the 
old 
inadequately 
large
group 
was 
destroyed, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
old 
habits 
and 
traditions, 
and 
step
by 
step 
a 
group 
was 
formed 
of 
larger 
dimensions 
with 
new 
customs 
and
traditions, 
and 
a 
man 
was 
produced 
who<p>
would 
stand 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the
coming 
movement 
and 
bear 
the 
responsibility 
for 
all 
that 
had 
to 
be 
done.

A 
man 
without 
convictions, 
without 
habits, 
without 
traditions, 
without
a 
name, 
and 
not 
even 
a 
Frenchman, 
emerges-by 
what 
seem 
the 
strangest
chances-from 
among 
all 
the 
seething 
French 
parties, 
and 
without 
joining
any 
one 
of 
them 
is 
borne 
forward 
to 
a 
prominent 
position.

The 
ignorance 
of 
his 
colleagues, 
the 
weakness 
and 
insignificance 
of
his 
opponents, 
the 
frankness 
of 
his 
falsehoods, 
and 
the 
dazzling 
and
self-confident 
limitations 
of 
this 
man 
raise 
him 
to 
the 
head 
of 
the
army. 
The 
brilliant 
qualities 
of 
the 
soldiers 
of 
the 
army 
sent 
to 
Italy,
his 
opponents' 
reluctance 
to 
fight, 
and 
his 
own 
childish 
audacity 
and
self-confidence 
secure 
him 
military 
fame. 
Innumerable 
so-called 
chances
accompany 
him 
everywhere. 
The 
disfavor 
into 
which 
he 
falls 
with 
the
rulers 
of 
France 
turns 
to 
his 
advantage. 
His 
attempts 
to 
avoid 
his
predestined 
path 
are 
unsuccessful: 
he 
is 
not 
received 
into 
the 
Russian
service, 
and 
the 
appointment 
he 
seeks 
in 
Turkey 
comes 
to 
nothing. 
During
the 
war 
in 
Italy 
he<p>
is 
several 
times 
on 
the 
verge 
of 
destruction 
and
each 
time 
is 
saved 
in 
an 
unexpected 
manner. 
Owing 
to 
various 
diplomatic
considerations 
the 
Russian 
armies-just 
those 
which 
might 
have 
destroyed
his 
prestige-do 
not 
appear 
upon 
the 
scene 
till 
he 
is 
no 
longer 
there.

On 
his 
return 
from 
Italy 
he 
finds 
the 
government 
in 
Paris 
in 
a 
process
of 
dissolution 
in 
which 
all 
those 
who 
are 
in 
it 
are 
inevitably 
wiped
out 
and<p>
destroyed. 
And 
by 
chance 
an 
escape 
from 
this 
dangerous 
position
presents 
itself 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
aimless 
and 
senseless 
expedition
to 
Africa. 
Again 
so-called 
chance 
accompanies 
him. 
Impregnable 
Malta
surrenders 
without 
a 
shot; 
his 
most 
reckless 
schemes 
are 
crowned 
with
success. 
The 
enemy's 
fleet, 
which 
subsequently 
did 
not 
let 
a 
single 
boat
pass, 
allows 
his 
entire 
army 
to 
elude 
it. 
In 
Africa 
a<p>
whole 
series 
of
outrages 
are 
committed 
against 
the 
almost 
unarmed 
inhabitants. 
And 
the
men 
who 
commit 
these 
crimes, 
especially 
their 
leader, 
assure 
themselves
that 
this 
is 
admirable, 
this 
is 
glory-it 
resembles 
Caesar 
and 
Alexander
the 
Great 
and 
is 
therefore 
good.

This 
ideal 
of 
glory 
and 
grandeur-which 
consists 
not 
merely 
in
considering 
nothing 
wrong 
that 
one 
does 
but
