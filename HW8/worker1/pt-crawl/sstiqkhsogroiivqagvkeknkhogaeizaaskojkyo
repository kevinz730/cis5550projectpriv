"It's 
all 
over; 
but 
I 
am 
a 
coward-yes, 
a 
coward!" 
thought
Rostov, 
and 
sighing 
deeply 
he 
took 
Rook, 
his 
horse, 
which 
stood 
resting
one 
foot, 
from 
the 
orderly 
and 
began 
to 
mount.

"Was 
<a href="/cZl/tQp9Yvhw6iOfK3lFuWA.html">that</a> 
grapeshot?" 
he 
asked 
Denisov.

"Yes 
and 
no 
mistake!" 
cried 
Denisov. 
"You 
worked 
like 
wegular
bwicks 
and 
it's 
nasty 
work! 
An 
attack's 
pleasant 
<a href="/aVzUge/bj5pWxqu9.html">work!</a> 
Hacking
away 
at 
the 
dogs! 
But 
this 
sort 
of 
thing 
is 
the 
very 
devil, 
with 
them
shooting 
at 
you 
like 
a 
target."

And 
Denisov 
rode 
up 
to 
a 
group 
that 
had 
stopped 
near 
Rostov, 
composed
of 
the 
colonel, 
Nesvitski, 
Zherkov, 
and 
the 
officer 
from 
the 
suite.

"Well,<p>
it 
seems 
that 
no 
one 
has 
noticed," 
thought 
Rostov. 
And 
this
was 
true. 
No 
one 
had 
taken 
any 
notice, 
for 
everyone 
knew 
the 
sensation
which 
the 
cadet 
under 
fire 
for 
the 
first 
time 
had 
experienced.

"Here's 
something 
for 
you 
to 
report," 
said 
Zherkov. 
"See 
if 
I
don't 
get 
promoted 
to 
a 
sublieutenancy."

"Inform 
the 
prince 
that 
I 
the 
bridge 
fired!" 
said 
the 
colonel
triumphantly 
and 
gaily.

"And 
if 
he 
asks 
about 
the 
losses?"

"A 
trifle," 
said 
the 
colonel 
in 
his 
bass 
voice: 
"two 
hussars
wounded, 
and 
one 
knocked 
out," 
he 
added, 
unable 
to 
restrain 
a 
happy
smile, 
and 
pronouncing 
the 
phrase 
"knocked 
out" 
with 
ringing
distinctness.
