"If 
I 
were 
a 
woman 
I 
would 
do 
so, 
Mary. 
That 
is 
a 
woman's 
virtue. 
But
a 
man 
should 
not 
and 
cannot 
forgive 
and 
forget," 
he 
replied, 
and 
though
till 
that 
moment 
he 
had 
not 
been 
thinking 
of 
Kuragin, 
all 
his 
unexpended
anger 
suddenly 
swelled 
up 
in 
his 
heart.

"If 
Mary 
is 
already 
persuading 
me 
to 
forgive, 
it 
means 
that 
I 
ought 
long
ago 
to 
have 
punished 
him," 
he 
thought. 
And 
giving 
her 
no 
further 
reply,
he 
began 
thinking 
of 
the 
<a href="/cZl/EA7bXmQ8JEcRg8.html">glad</a> 
vindictive 
moment 
when 
he 
would 
meet
Kuragin 
who 
he 
knew 
was 
now 
in 
the 
army.

Princess 
Mary 
begged 
him 
to 
stay 
one 
day 
more, 
saying<p>
that 
she 
knew 
how
unhappy 
her 
father 
would 
be 
if 
Andrew 
left 
without 
being 
reconciled 
to
him, 
but 
Prince 
Andrew 
replied 
that 
he 
would 
probably 
soon 
be 
back 
again
from 
the 
army 
and 
would 
certainly 
write 
to 
his 
father, 
but 
that 
the
longer 
he 
stayed 
now 
the 
more 
embittered 
their 
differences 
would 
become.

"Good-by, 
Andrew! 
Remember 
that 
misfortunes 
come 
from 
God, 
and 
men 
are
never 
to 
blame," 
were 
the 
last 
words 
he 
heard 
from 
his 
sister 
when 
he
took 
leave 
of 
her.

"Then 
it 
must 
be 
so!" 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew 
as 
he 
drove 
out 
of 
the
avenue 
from 
the 
house 
at 
Bald 
Hills.

poor 
innocent 
creature,
