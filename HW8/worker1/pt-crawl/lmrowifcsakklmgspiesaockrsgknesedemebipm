Besides, 
it 
seemed 
to 
him 
that 
the
society 
of 
women 
was 
rather 
derogatory 
to 
his 
manhood. 
He 
went 
to 
balls
and 
into 
ladies' 
society 
with 
an 
affectation 
of 
doing 
so 
against 
his
will. 
The 
races, 
the 
English 
Club, 
sprees 
with 
Denisov, 
and<p>
visits 
to
a 
certain 
house-that 
was 
another 
matter 
and 
quite 
the 
thing 
for 
a
dashing 
young 
hussar!

At 
the 
beginning 
of 
March, 
old 
Count 
Ilya 
Rostov 
was 
very 
busy
arranging 
a 
dinner 
in 
honor 
of 
Prince 
Bagration 
at 
the 
English 
Club.

The 
count 
walked 
up 
and 
down 
the 
hall 
in 
his 
dressing 
gown, 
giving
orders 
to 
the 
club 
steward 
and 
to 
the 
famous 
Feoktist, 
the 
club's
head 
cook, 
about 
asparagus, 
fresh 
cucumbers, 
strawberries, 
veal, 
and
fish 
for 
this 
dinner. 
The 
count 
had 
been 
a 
member 
and 
on 
the 
committee
of 
the 
club<p>
from 
the 
day 
it 
was 
founded. 
To 
him 
the 
club 
entrusted 
the
arrangement 
of 
the 
festival 
in 
honor 
of 
Bagration, 
for 
few 
men 
knew
so 
well 
how 
to 
arrange 
<a href="/cZl/dG51mk.html">a</a> 
feast 
on 
an 
open-handed, 
hospitable 
scale,
and 
still 
fewer 
men 
would 
be 
so 
well 
able 
and 
willing 
to 
make 
up 
out 
of
their 
own 
resources 
what 
might 
be 
needed 
for 
the 
success 
of 
the 
fete.
The 
club 
cook 
and 
the 
steward 
listened 
to 
the 
count's 
orders 
with
pleased 
faces, 
for 
they 
knew 
that 
under 
no 
other 
management 
could 
they
so 
easily 
extract 
a 
good 
profit 
for 
themselves 
from 
a 
dinner 
costing
several 
thousand 
rubles.

"Well 
then, 
mind 
and 
have 
cocks' 
comb 
in 
the 
turtle 
soup, 
you
know!"

"Shall 
we 
have 
three 
cold 
dishes 
then?" 
asked 
the 
cook.

The 
count 
considered.

"We 
can't 
have 
less-yes, 
three... 
the 
mayonnaise, 
that's 
one,"
said 
he, 
bending 
down 
a 
finger.

"Then 
am 
I 
to 
order 
those 
large 
sterlets?" 
asked 
the 
steward.

"Yes, 
it 
can't 
be 
helped 
if 
they 
won't 
take 
less. 
<a href="/aVzUge/pD9Vd5AyyZE3wUl.html">Ah,</a> 
dear 
me! 
I
was 
forgetting. 
We 
must 
have 
another 
entree. 
Ah, 
goodness 
gracious!"
he 
clutched 
at 
his 
head. 
"Who 
is 
going 
to 
get 
me 
the 
flowers? 
Dmitri!
Eh, 
Dmitri! 
Gallop 
off 
to 
our 
Moscow 
estate," 
he 
said 
to 
the 
factotum
who 
appeared 
at 
his 
call. 
"Hurry 
off 
and 
tell 
Maksim, 
the 
gardener,
to 
set 
the 
serfs 
to 
work. 
Say 
that 
everything 
out 
of 
the 
hothouses 
must
be 
brought 
here 
well 
wrapped 
up 
in 
felt. 
I 
must 
have 
two 
hundred 
pots
here 
on 
Friday."

Having 
given 
several 
more 
orders, 
he 
was 
about 
to 
go 
to 
his 
"little
countess" 
to 
have 
a 
rest, 
but 
remembering 
something 
else 
of
importance, 
he 
returned 
again, 
called 
back 
the 
cook 
and 
the<p>
club
steward, 
and 
again 
began 
giving 
orders. 
A 
light 
footstep 
and 
the
clinking 
of 
spurs<p>
were 
heard 
at 
the 
door, 
and 
the 
young 
count, 
handsome,
rosy, 
with 
a 
dark 
little 
mustache, 
evidently 
rested 
and 
made 
sleeker<p>
by
his 
easy 
life 
in 
Moscow, 
entered 
the 
room.

"Ah, 
<a href="/cZl/iLv3NSUp0bZDWZ2bE.html">my</a> 
boy, 
my 
head's<p>
in 
a 
whirl!" 
said 
the 
old 
man 
with 
a 
smile,
as 
if 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/iP7IgdEd78g.html">he</a> 
felt 
a 
little 
confused 
before 
his 
son. 
"Now, 
if 
you 
would
only 
help 
a 
bit! 
I 
must 
have 
singers 
too. 
I 
shall 
have 
my 
own 
orchestra,
but
