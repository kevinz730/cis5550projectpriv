Nesvitski 
as</h1>he 
drew 
up, 
taking 
off 
his
cap 
and<p>
smoothing 
his 
hair 
wet 
with 
perspiration 
with 
his 
plump 
hand,
"wasn't 
I 
telling 
you 
to 
fire 
the 
bridge, 
when 
inflammable 
material
had 
been 
put 
in 
position?"

"I 
am 
not 
your 
'dear 
sir,' 
Mr. 
Staff 
Officer, 
and 
you 
did 
not 
tell
me 
to 
burn 
the 
bridge! 
I 
know 
the 
service, 
and 
it 
is 
my 
habit 
orders
strictly 
to 
obey. 
You 
said 
the 
bridge 
would 
be 
burned, 
but 
who 
would
burn 
it, 
I 
could 
not 
know 
by 
the 
holy 
spirit!"

"Ah, 
that's 
always 
the 
way!" 
said 
Nesvitski 
with 
a 
wave 
of 
the
hand. 
"How 
did 
you 
get 
here?" 
said 
he, 
turning 
to 
Zherkov.

"On 
the 
same 
business. 
But 
you 
are 
damp! 
Let 
me 
wring 
you 
out!"

"You 
were 
saying, 
Mr. 
Staff 
Officer..." 
continued 
the 
colonel 
in 
an
offended 
tone.

"Colonel," 
interrupted 
the 
officer 
of 
the 
suite, 
"You 
must 
be
quick 
or<p>
the 
enemy 
will 
bring 
up 
his 
guns 
to 
use 
grapeshot."

The 
colonel 
looked 
silently

the 
suite, 
at 
<a href="/cZl/KA8qrwB3aAKED9eyxg.html">the</a> 
stout

and 
at 
Zherkov, 
and 
he 
frowned.

"I 
will 
the 
bridge 
fire," 
he 
said 
in 
a 
solemn 
tone 
as 
if 
to 
announce
that 
in

the 
unpleasantness 
he

would
