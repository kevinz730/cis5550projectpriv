in 
hand, 
their 
whole 
property 
would 
be 
sold 
by 
auction<p>
and
they 
would 
all 
have 
to 
go 
begging. 
The 
count 
was 
so 
weak, 
and 
trusted
Mitenka 
so 
much, 
and 
was 
so 
good-natured, 
that 
everybody 
took 
advantage
of 
him 
and 
things 
were 
going 
from 
bad 
to 
worse. 
"For 
God's 
sake, 
I
implore 
you, 
come 
at 
once 
if 
you 
do 
<a href="/cZl/al5bOIDr0VWVhi1U.html">not</a> 
wish

make 
me 
and 
the 
whole

wretched,"

the

This 
letter 
<a href="/aVzUge/kp76v8dkSm.html">touched</a> 
Nicholas. 
He 
had 
that 
common 
sense 
of 
a
matter-of-fact 
man 
which 
showed 
him 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/gv8sCi8PFi5qB.html">what</a> 
he 
ought 
to 
do.

The 
right 
thing 
now 
was, 
if 
not 
to 
retire 
from 
the 
service, 
at 
any 
rate
to 
go 
home 
on<p>
leave. 
Why 
he 
had 
to 
go 
he 
did 
not 
know; 
but 
after 
his
after-dinner 
nap 
he 
gave 
orders 
to 
saddle 
Mars, 
an 
extremely 
vicious
gray 
stallion 
that 
had 
not 
been 
ridden 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
and 
when
he 
returned 
with 
the 
horse 
all 
in 
a 
lather, 
he 
informed 
Lavrushka
(Denisov's 
servant 
who 
had 
remained 
with 
him) 
and 
his 
comrades 
who
turned 
up 
in 
the 
evening 
that 
he 
was 
applying 
for 
leave 
and 
was 
going
home. 
Difficult 
and 
strange 
as 
it 
was<p>
for 
him 
to 
reflect 
that 
he 
would
go 
away 
without 
having 
heard 
from 
the 
staff-and 
this 
interested 
him
extremely-whether 
he 
was 
promoted 
<a href="/aVzUge/zN7AXsTm3VEt2W.html">to</a> 
a 
captaincy 
or 
would 
receive 
the
Order 
of 
St. 
Anne 
for 
the 
last 
maneuvers; 
strange 
as 
it 
was 
to 
think
that 
he 
would 
go 
away 
without 
having 
sold 
his 
three 
roans 
to 
the 
Polish
Count 
Golukhovski, 
who 
was 
bargaining 
for 
the 
horses 
Rostov 
had 
betted
he 
would 
sell 
for 
two 
thousand 
rubles; 
incomprehensible 
as 
it
seemed 
<a href="/aVzUge/wc9U.html">that</a> 
the 
ball 
the 
hussars 
were 
giving 
in 
honor 
of 
the 
Polish
Mademoiselle 
Przazdziecka 
(out 
of 
rivalry 
to 
the 
Uhlans 
who 
had 
given
one 
in 
honor 
of 
their 
Polish 
Mademoiselle 
Borzozowska) 
would 
take 
place
without 
him-he 
knew 
he 
must 
go 
away 
from 
this 
good, 
bright 
world 
to
somewhere 
where 
everything 
was 
stupid 
and 
confused. 
A 
week 
later 
he
obtained 
his 
leave. 
His 
hussar 
comrades-not 
only 
those 
of 
his 
own
regiment,
