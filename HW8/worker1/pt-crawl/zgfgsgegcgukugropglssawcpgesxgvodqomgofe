But 
this 
uneasiness 
lasted 
only 
a 
moment. 
He 
felt
it 
necessary 
to 
hold 
his 
head 
higher, 
to 
brace 
himself, 
and 
to 
question
the 
esaul 
with 
an 
air 
of 
importance 
about 
tomorrow's 
undertaking, 
that
he 
might 
not 
be 
unworthy 
of 
the 
company 
in 
which 
he 
found 
himself.

The 
officer 
who 
had 
been 
sent 
to 
inquire 
met 
Denisov 
on 
the 
way 
with 
the
news 
that 
Dolokhov 
was 
soon 
coming 
and 
that 
all 
was 
well 
with 
him.

Denisov 
at 
once 
cheered 
up 
and,

said: 
"Well,

about 
yourself."





CHAPTER 
VII

Petya, 
having 
left 
his 
people 
after 
their 
departure 
from 
Moscow, 
joined
his 
regiment 
and 
was 
soon 
taken 
as 
orderly 
by 
a 
general 
commanding 
a
large 
guerrilla 
detachment. 
From 
the 
time 
he 
received 
his 
commission,
and 
especially 
since 
he 
had 
joined 
the 
active 
army 
and 
taken 
part 
in
the 
battle 
of 
Vyazma, 
Petya 
had 
been 
in 
a 
constant 
state 
of 
blissful
excitement 
at 
being 
grown-up 
and 
in 
a 
perpetual 
ecstatic 
hurry 
not 
to
miss 
any 
chance 
to 
do 
something 
really 
heroic. 
He 
was 
highly 
delighted
with 
what 
he 
saw 
<a href="/aVzUge/Zo3on9R8.html">and</a> 
experienced 
in
