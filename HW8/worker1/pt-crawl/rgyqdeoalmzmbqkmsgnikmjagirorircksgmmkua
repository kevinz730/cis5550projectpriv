called 
to</h1>breakfast. 
Natasha 
kept 
looking
uneasily 
at 
everybody 
with 
wide-open 
eyes, 
as 
if<p>
wishing 
to 
intercept
every 
glance 
directed 
toward 
her, 
and 
tried 
to 
appear 
the 
same 
as 
usual.

After 
breakfast, 
which 
was 
her 
best 
time, 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
sat 
down 
in
her 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/MjR5A9Fmd9tTlW.html">armchair</a> 
and 
called 
Natasha 
and 
the 
count 
to 
her.

"Well, 
friends, 
I 
have 
now 
thought 
the 
whole 
matter 
over 
and 
this 
is
my 
advice," 
she 
began. 
"Yesterday, 
as 
you 
know,<p>
<a href="/aVzUge/zr2GLq9s.html">I</a> 
went 
to 
see 
Prince
Bolkonski. 
Well, 
I 
had 
a 
talk 
with 
him.... 
He 
took 
it 
into 
his 
head 
to
begin 
shouting, 
but 
I 
am 
not 
one 
to 
be 
shouted 
down. 
I 
said 
what 
I 
had
to 
say!"

"Well, 
and 
he?" 
asked 
the 
count.

"He? 
He's 
crazy... 
he 
did 
not 
want 
to 
listen. 
But 
what's 
the 
use
of 
talking? 
As 
it 
is 
we 
have 
<a href="/cZl/xt2OfLLj2l2l.html">worn</a> 
the 
poor<p>
girl 
out," 
said 
Marya
Dmitrievna. 
"My 
advice 
to 
you 
is 
finish 
your 
business 
and 
go 
back
home 
to 
Otradnoe... 
and 
wait 
there."

"Oh, 
no!" 
exclaimed 
Natasha.

"Yes, 
go 
back," 
said 
Marya 
Dmitrievna, 
"and 
wait 
there. 
If<p>
your
betrothed 
comes 
here 
now-there 
will 
be 
no 
avoiding 
a 
quarrel; 
but
alone 
with 
the 
old 
man 
he 
will 
talk 
things 
over 
and 
then 
come 
on 
to
you."

Count 
Rostov 
approved 
of 
this 
suggestion, 
appreciating 
its
reasonableness. 
If 
the 
old 
man 
came 
round 
it 
would 
be 
all 
the 
better 
to
visit 
him 
in 
Moscow 
or 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
later 
on; 
and 
if 
not, 
the 
wedding,
against 
his 
wishes, 
could 
only 
be 
arranged 
at 
Otradnoe.

"That 
is 
perfectly 
true. 
And 
I 
am 
sorry 
I 
went 
to 
see 
him 
and 
took
her," 
said 
the 
old 
count.

"No, 
why 
be 
sorry? 
Being 
here, 
you 
had 
to 
pay 
your 
respects. 
But 
if 
he
won't-that's 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ks6HPeSU4O0qQI.html">his</a> 
affair," 
said 
Marya 
Dmitrievna, 
looking 
for
something 
in 
her 
reticule. 
"Besides, 
the 
trousseau 
is 
ready, 
so 
there
is 
nothing 
to 
wait 
for; 
and 
what 
is 
not 
ready 
I'll 
send 
after 
you.
Though 
I 
don't 
like 
letting 
you 
go, 
it 
is 
the 
best 
way. 
So 
go, 
with
God's 
blessing!"

Having 
found 
what 
she 
was 
looking 
for 
in 
the 
reticule 
she 
handed 
it 
to
Natasha.
