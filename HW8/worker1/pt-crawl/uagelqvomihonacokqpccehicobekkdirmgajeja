When 
Pierre 
saw 
his</h1>neighbor 
next 
morning 
at 
dawn
the 
first 
impression 
of 
him, 
as 
of 
something 
round, 
was 
fully 
confirmed:
Platon's 
whole 
figure-in 
a 
French 
overcoat 
girdled 
with 
a 
cord, 
a
soldier's 
cap, 
and 
bast 
shoes-was 
round. 
His 
head 
was 
quite 
round, 
his
back, 
chest, 
shoulders, 
and 
even 
his 
arms, 
which 
he 
held 
as 
if 
ever
ready 
to 
embrace 
something, 
were 
rounded, 
his 
pleasant 
smile 
and 
his
large, 
gentle 
brown 
eyes 
were 
also 
round.

Platon 
Karataev 
must 
have 
been 
fifty, 
judging 
by 
his 
stories 
of
campaigns 
he 
had 
been 
in, 
told 
as 
by 
an 
old 
soldier. 
He 
did 
not 
himself
know 
his 
age 
and 
was<p>
quite 
<a href="/cZl/Zb730NY.html">unable</a> 
to 
determine 
it. 
But 
his 
brilliantly
white, 
strong 
teeth 
which 
showed 
in 
two 
unbroken 
semicircles 
when 
he
laughed-as 
he 
often 
did-were 
all 
sound 
and 
good, 
there 
was 
not 
a 
gray
hair 
in 
his 
beard 
or 
on 
his 
head, 
and 
his 
whole 
body 
gave 
an 
impression
of 
suppleness 
and 
especially 
of 
firmness 
and 
endurance.

His 
face, 
despite 
its 
fine, 
rounded 
wrinkles, 
had 
an 
expression 
of
innocence 
and 
youth, 
his 
voice 
was 
pleasant 
and 
musical. 
But 
the 
chief
peculiarity 
of 
his 
speech 
was 
its 
directness 
and 
appositeness. 
It 
was
evident 
that 
he 
never 
considered 
what 
he 
had 
said 
or 
was 
going 
to 
say,
and 
consequently 
the 
rapidity 
and 
justice 
of 
his<p>
intonation 
had 
an
irresistible 
persuasiveness.

His 
physical 
strength 
and 
agility 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/RH2qQqw13.html">during</a> 
the 
first 
days 
of 
his
imprisonment 
were 
such 
that 
<a href="/cZl/Zdn31xHdu.html">he</a> 
seemed 
not 
to 
know 
what 
fatigue 
and
sickness 
meant. 
Every 
night 
before 
lying 
down, 
he 
said: 
"Lord, 
lay 
me
down 
as 
a 
stone 
and 
raise 
me 
up 
as 
a 
loaf!" 
and 
every 
morning 
on 
getting
up, 
he 
said: 
"I 
lay 
down 
and 
curled 
up, 
I 
get 
up 
and 
shake 
myself." 
And
indeed 
he 
only 
had 
to 
lie 
down, 
to 
fall 
asleep<p>
like 
a 
stone, 
and 
he
only 
had 
to 
shake 
himself, 
to 
be 
ready 
without 
a 
moment's 
delay 
for 
some
work, 
just 
as 
children 
are 
ready 
to 
play 
directly 
they 
awake. 
He 
could
do 
everything, 
not 
very 
well 
but 
not 
badly. 
He 
baked, 
cooked, 
sewed,
planed, 
and 
mended 
boots. 
He 
was 
always 
busy, 
and 
only 
at 
night 
allowed
himself 
conversation-of 
which 
he 
was 
fond-and 
songs. 
He 
did 
not 
sing
like 
a 
trained 
singer 
who 
knows 
he 
is 
listened 
to,<p>
but 
like 
the 
birds,
evidently 
giving 
vent 
to 
the 
sounds 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
one 
stretches
oneself 
or 
walks 
about 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
stiffness, 
and 
the 
sounds 
were
always 
high-pitched, 
mournful, 
delicate, 
and 
almost 
feminine, 
and 
his
face 
at 
such 
times 
was 
very 
serious.

Having 
been 
taken 
prisoner 
and 
allowed 
his 
beard 
to 
grow, 
he 
seemed 
to
have 
thrown 
off 
all 
that 
had 
been 
forced 
upon 
him-everything 
military
and 
alien 
to 
himself-and 
had 
returned 
to 
his 
former 
peasant 
habits.

"A 
soldier 
on 
leave-a 
shirt 
outside 
breeches," 
he 
would 
say.

He 
did 
not 
like 
talking 
about 
his 
life 
as 
a 
soldier, 
though 
he 
did 
not
complain, 
and 
often 
mentioned 
that 
he 
had 
not 
been 
flogged 
once 
during
the 
whole 
of 
his 
army<p>
service. 
When 
he 
related 
anything 
it 
was 
generally
some 
old 
and 
evidently 
precious 
memory 
of 
his 
"Christian" 
life, 
as 
he
called 
his 
peasant 
existence. 
The 
proverbs, 
of 
which 
his 
talk 
was 
full,
were 
for 
the 
most 
part 
not 
the 
coarse 
and 
indecent 
saws 
soldiers
employ, 
but 
those 
folk 
sayings 
which 
taken 
without 
a 
context 
seem 
so
insignificant, 
but 
when 
used 
appositely
