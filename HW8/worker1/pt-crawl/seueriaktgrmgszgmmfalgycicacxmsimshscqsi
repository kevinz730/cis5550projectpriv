CHAPTER 
XII

The 
day 
after 
the 
opera 
the 
Rostovs 
went 
nowhere 
and 
nobody 
came 
to 
see
them. 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
talked 
to 
the 
count 
about 
something 
which 
they
concealed 
from 
Natasha. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ws76v3.html">Natasha</a> 
guessed 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/qd2jDLTN4m8v.html">they</a> 
were 
talking 
about 
the
old 
prince 
and 
planning 
something, 
and 
this 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bq5UTE0jTVGx.html">disquieted</a> 
and 
offended 
her.
She 
was 
expecting 
Prince 
Andrew 
any 
moment 
and 
twice 
that 
day 
sent 
a
manservant 
to 
the 
Vozdvizhenka 
to 
ascertain 
whether 
he 
had 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jM5rhMF4uR8.html">come.</a> 
He 
had
not 
arrived. 
She 
suffered 
more 
now 
than 
during 
her 
first 
days 
in 
Moscow.
To 
her 
impatience 
and 
pining 
for 
him 
were 
now 
added 
the 
unpleasant
recollection 
of 
her 
interview 
with 
Princess 
Mary 
and 
the 
old 
prince,
and 
a 
fear 
and 
anxiety 
of 
which 
she 
did 
not 
understand 
the 
cause. 
She
continually 
fancied 
that 
either 
he 
would 
never 
come 
or 
that 
something
would 
happen 
to 
her 
before 
he 
came. 
She 
could 
no 
longer 
think 
of 
him 
by
herself 
calmly 
and 
continuously 
as 
she 
had 
done 
before. 
As 
soon 
as 
she
began 
to 
think 
of 
him, 
the 
recollection 
of 
the 
old 
prince, 
of 
Princess
Mary, 
of 
the 
theater, 
and 
of 
Kuragin 
mingled 
with 
her 
thoughts. 
The
question 
again 
presented 
itself 
whether 
she 
was<p>
not 
guilty, 
whether 
she
had 
not 
already 
broken 
faith 
with 
Prince 
Andrew, 
and 
again 
she 
found
herself 
recalling 
to 
the 
minutest
