shouted 
Petya, 
and</h1>giving<p>
rein 
to 
his
excited 
horse 
he 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/JM10WMYlo2A.html">galloped</a> 
forward 
along 
the 
village 
street.

He 
could 
hear 
shooting 
ahead 
of 
him. 
Cossacks, 
hussars, 
and 
ragged
Russian 
prisoners, 
who 
had 
come 
running 
from 
both 
sides 
of 
the 
road,
were 
shouting 
something 
loudly 
and 
incoherently. 
A 
gallant-looking
Frenchman, 
in 
a 
blue 
overcoat, 
capless, 
and 
with 
a 
frowning 
red 
face,
had 
been 
defending 
himself 
against<p>
the 
hussars. 
When 
Petya 
galloped
up 
the 
Frenchman 
had 
already 
fallen. 
"Too 
late 
again!" 
flashed 
through
Petya's 
mind 
and 
he 
galloped 
on 
to 
the 
place 
from 
which 
the 
rapid 
firing
could 
be 
heard. 
The 
shots 
came 
from 
the 
yard 
of 
the 
landowner's 
house
he 
had 
visited 
the<p>
night 
before 
with 
Dolokhov. 
The 
French 
were 
making
a 
stand 
there 
behind 
a 
wattle 
fence 
in 
a 
garden 
thickly 
overgrown 
with
bushes 
and 
were 
firing<p>
at 
the 
Cossacks 
who 
crowded 
at 
the 
gateway.
Through 
the 
smoke, 
as 
he 
approached 
the 
gate, 
Petya 
saw 
Dolokhov, 
whose
face 
was 
of 
a 
pale-greenish 
tint, 
shouting 
to 
his<p>
men. 
"Go 
round! 
Wait
for 
the 
infantry!" 
he 
exclaimed 
as 
Petya 
rode 
up 
to 
him.

"Wait?... 
Hurrah-ah-ah!" 
shouted 
Petya, 
and 
without 
pausing 
a 
moment
galloped 
to 
the 
place 
whence 
came 
the 
sounds 
of 
firing 
and 
where 
the
smoke 
was 
thickest.

A 
volley 
was 
heard, 
and 
some 
bullets 
whistled 
past, 
while 
others 
plashed
against 
something. 
The 
Cossacks 
and 
Dolokhov 
galloped 
after 
Petya 
into
the 
gateway 
of 
the 
courtyard. 
In 
the 
dense 
wavering 
smoke 
some 
of 
the
French 
threw 
down 
their 
arms 
and 
ran 
out 
of 
the 
bushes 
to 
meet 
the
Cossacks, 
while 
others 
ran 
down 
the 
hill 
toward 
the 
pond. 
Petya 
was
galloping 
along 
the 
courtyard, 
but 
instead 
of 
holding 
the 
reins 
he 
waved
both 
his 
arms 
about 
rapidly 
and 
strangely, 
slipping 
farther 
and 
farther
to 
one 
side 
in 
his 
saddle. 
His 
horse, 
having 
galloped 
up 
to 
a 
campfire
that 
was 
smoldering 
in 
the 
morning 
light, 
stopped 
suddenly, 
and 
Petya
fell 
heavily 
on
