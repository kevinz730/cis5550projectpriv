face,

were 
audible.

"Count!... 
Don't 
ruin 
a 
young 
fellow... 
here 
is 
this 
wretched 
money,
take 
it..." 
He 
threw 
it 
on 
the 
table. 
"I 
have 
an 
old 
father 
and
mother!..."

Rostov 
took 
the 
money, 
avoiding 
Telyanin's 
eyes, 
and 
went 
out 
of 
the
room 
without 
a 
word. 
But 
at 
the 
door 
he 
stopped 
and 
then 
retraced 
his
steps. 
"O 
God," 
he 
said 
with 
tears 
in 
his 
eyes, 
"how 
could 
you 
do
it?"

"Count..." 
said 
Telyanin 
drawing 
nearer 
to 
him.

"Don't 
touch 
me," 
said 
Rostov, 
drawing 
back. 
"If 
you 
need 
it,
take 
the 
money," 
and 
he 
threw 
the 
purse 
to 
him 
and 
ran 
out 
of 
the 
inn.





CHAPTER 
V

That 
same 
evening 
there 
was 
an 
animated 
discussion 
among 
the
squadron's 
officers 
in 
Denisov's 
quarters.

"And 
I 
tell 
you, 
Rostov, 
that 
you 
must 
apologize 
to 
the 
colonel!"
said 
a 
tall, 
grizzly-haired 
staff 
captain, 
with 
enormous 
mustaches 
<a href="/aVzUge/YE7mbEd9f4tHLaX.html">and
many</a> 
wrinkles 
on 
his 
large 
features, 
to 
Rostov 
who 
was 
crimson 
with
excitement.

The 
staff 
captain, 
Kirsten, 
had 
twice 
been 
reduced 
to 
the 
ranks 
for
affairs 
of 
honor 
and 
had 
twice 
regained 
<a href="/aVzUge/zJ4UDh7Nz3s.html">his</a> 
commission.

"I 
will 
allow 
no 
one 
to 
call 
me 
a 
liar!" 
cried 
Rostov. 
"He 
told
me 
I 
lied, 
and 
I 
told 
him 
he 
lied. 
And 
there 
it 
rests. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/YI3tTZW0YfX3EJ.html">He</a> 
may 
keep 
me
on 
duty 
every 
day, 
or 
may 
place 
me 
under 
arrest, 
but 
no 
one 
can 
make
me 
apologize, 
because 
if 
he, 
as 
commander 
of 
this 
regiment, 
thinks 
it
beneath 
his 
dignity 
to 
give 
me 
satisfaction, 
then..."

"You 
just 
wait 
a 
moment, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
and 
listen," 
interrupted
the 
staff 
captain 
in 
his 
deep 
bass, 
calmly 
stroking 
his 
long 
mustache.
"You 
tell 
the 
colonel 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
other 
officers 
that 
an
officer 
has 
stolen..."

"I'm 
not 
to 
blame 
that 
the 
conversation 
began 
in 
the 
presence 
of
other 
officers. 
Perhaps 
I 
ought 
not 
to 
have 
spoken 
before 
them, 
but 
I 
am
not 
a 
diplomatist. 
That's 
why 
I 
joined 
the 
hussars, 
thinking 
that 
here
one 
would 
not 
need 
finesse; 
and 
he 
tells 
me 
that 
I 
am 
lying-so 
let 
him
give 
me 
satisfaction..."

"That's 
all 
right. 
No 
one 
thinks 
you 
a 
coward, 
but 
that's 
not 
the
point. 
Ask 
Denisov 
whether 
it 
is 
not 
out 
of 
the 
question 
for 
a 
cadet 
to
demand 
satisfaction 
of 
his 
regimental 
commander?"

Denisov 
sat 
gloomily 
biting 
his 
mustache<p>
and 
listening 
to 
the
conversation, 
evidently 
with 
no 
wish 
to 
take 
part 
in 
it. 
He 
answered 
the
staff 
captain's 
question 
by 
a 
disapproving 
shake 
of 
his 
head.

"You 
speak 
to 
the 
colonel 
about 
this<p>
nasty 
business 
before 
other
officers," 
continued 
the 
staff 
captain, 
"and 
Bogdanich" 
(the
colonel 
was 
called 
Bogdanich) 
"shuts 
you 
up."

"He 
did 
not 
shut 
me 
up, 
he 
said 
I 
was 
telling 
an 
untruth."

"Well, 
have 
it 
so, 
and 
you 
talked 
a<p>
lot 
of 
nonsense 
to 
him 
and 
must
apologize."

"Not 
on 
any 
account!" 
exclaimed 
Rostov.

"I 
did 
not 
expect 
this 
of 
you," 
said 
the 
staff 
captain 
seriously 
and
severely. 
"You 
don't 
wish 
to 
apologize, 
but, 
man, 
it's 
not 
only 
to
him 
but 
to 
the 
whole 
regiment-all 
of 
us-you're 
to 
blame 
all 
round.
The 
case 
is 
this: 
you 
ought 
to 
have 
thought 
the 
matter 
over 
and
taken 
advice;<p>
but 
no, 
you 
go 
and 
blurt 
it 
all 
straight 
out 
before 
the
officers. 
Now 
what 
was 
the 
colonel 
to 
do? 
Have 
the 
officer 
tried<p>
and
disgrace 
the 
whole 
regiment? 
Disgrace 
the 
whole 
regiment 
because 
of 
one
scoundrel? 
Is 
that 
how 
you 
look 
at 
it? 
We 
don't 
see 
it 
like 
that. 
And
Bogdanich 
was 
a 
brick: 
he 
told 
you 
you 
were 
saying 
what 
was 
not 
true.
It's 
not 
pleasant, 
but 
what's 
to 
be 
done, 
my 
dear 
fellow? 
You 
landed
yourself 
in 
it. 
And 
now, 
when 
one 
wants 
to 
smooth 
the 
thing 
over, 
some
conceit 
prevents 
your 
apologizing, 
and 
you 
wish 
to 
make 
the 
whole
affair 
public. 
You 
are 
offended<p>
at 
being 
put 
on 
duty 
a 
bit, 
but 
why 
not
apologize 
to 
an 
old 
and 
honorable 
officer? 
Whatever 
Bogdanich 
may
be, 
anyway 
he 
is 
an 
honorable 
and 
brave 
old 
colonel! 
You're 
quick 
at
taking 
offense, 
but
