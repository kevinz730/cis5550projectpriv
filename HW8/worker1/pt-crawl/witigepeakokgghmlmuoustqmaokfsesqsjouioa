"You 
see," 
said 
Berg 
to</h1>his 
comrade, 
whom 
he 
called 
"friend"
only 
because 
he 
knew 
that 
everyone 
has 
friends, 
"you 
see, 
I 
have
considered 
it 
<a href="/aVzUge/kN1SN39Pq.html">all,</a> 
and 
should 
not 
marry 
if 
I 
had 
not 
thought 
it 
all 
out
or 
if 
it 
were 
in 
any 
way 
unsuitable. 
But 
on 
the 
<a href="/cZl/Us8ej9WSr8RHGI.html">contrary,</a> 
my 
papa 
and
mamma 
are 
<a href="/aVzUge/qB7Pe8AJH6.html">now</a> 
provided 
for-I 
have 
arranged 
that 
rent 
for 
them 
in 
the
Baltic 
Provinces-and 
I 
can 
live<p>
in 
Petersburg 
on 
my 
pay, 
and 
with
her 
fortune 
and 
my 
good 
management 
we 
can 
get 
along 
nicely. 
I 
am 
not
marrying 
for 
money-I 
consider 
that 
dishonorable-but 
a 
wife 
should
bring 
her 
share 
and 
a 
husband 
his. 
I 
have 
my 
position 
in 
the 
service,
she 
has 
connections 
and 
some 
means. 
In 
our 
times 
that 
is 
worth
something, 
isn't 
it? 
But 
above 
all, 
she 
is 
a 
handsome, 
estimable 
girl,
and 
she 
loves 
me...."

Berg 
blushed 
and 
smiled.

"And 
I 
love 
her, 
because 
her 
character 
is 
sensible 
and 
very 
good.
