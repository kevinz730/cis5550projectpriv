round 
to 
the 
right 
of 
the 
Moskva. 
But 
wherever 
it 
may 
be,
many 
a 
man 
will 
be 
missing 
tomorrow!" 
he 
remarked.

An 
elderly 
sergeant<p>
who 
had 
approached 
the 
officer 
while 
he 
was 
giving
these 
explanations 
had 
waited 
in 
silence 
for 
him 
to 
finish 
speaking, 
but
at 
this 
point, 
evidently 
not 
liking 
the 
officer's 
remark, 
interrupted
him.

"Gabions 
must 
be 
sent 
for," 
said 
he 
sternly.

The 
officer 
appeared 
abashed, 
as 
though 
he 
understood 
that 
one 
might
think 
of 
how 
many 
men 
would 
be 
missing 
tomorrow 
but 
ought 
not 
to 
speak
of 
it.

"Well, 
send 
number 
three 
company 
again," 
the 
officer 
replied 
hurriedly.

"And 
you, 
are 
you 
one 
of 
the 
doctors?"

"No, 
I've 
come 
on 
my 
own," 
answered 
Pierre, 
and 
he 
went 
down 
the 
hill
again, 
passing 
the 
militiamen.

"Oh, 
those 
damned 
fellows!" 
muttered 
the 
officer 
who 
followed 
him,
holding 
his 
nose 
as 
he 
ran 
past 
the 
men 
at 
work.

"There 
they 
are... 
bringing 
her, 
coming... 
There 
they 
are... 
They'll 
be
here 
in 
a 
minute..." 
voices 
were 
suddenly 
heard 
saying; 
and 
officers,
soldiers, 
and 
militiamen 
began 
running 
forward 
along 
the 
road.

A 
church 
procession 
was 
coming 
up 
the 
hill 
from 
Borodino. 
First 
along
the 
dusty 
road 
came 
the 
infantry 
in 
ranks, 
bareheaded 
and 
with 
arms
reversed. 
From<p>
behind 
them 
came 
the 
sound 
of 
church<p>
singing.

Soldiers 
and 
militiamen 
ran 
bareheaded 
past 
Pierre 
toward 
the
procession.

"They 
are 
bringing 
her, 
our 
Protectress!... 
The 
Iberian 
Mother 
of 
God!"
someone 
cried.

"The 
Smolensk 
Mother 
of 
God," 
another 
corrected 
him.

The 
militiamen, 
both 
those 
who 
had 
been 
in 
the 
village 
and 
those 
who 
had
been 
at 
work 
on 
the 
battery, 
threw 
down 
their 
spades 
and 
ran 
to 
meet 
the
church 
procession. 
Following 
the 
battalion 
that 
marched 
along 
the 
dusty
road 
came 
priests 
in 
their 
vestments-one 
little 
old 
man 
in 
a 
hood 
with
attendants 
and 
singers. 
Behind 
them 
soldiers 
and 
officers 
bore 
a 
large,
dark-faced 
icon 
with 
an 
embossed 
metal 
cover. 
This 
was 
the 
icon 
that 
had
been 
brought 
from 
Smolensk 
and 
had 
since 
accompanied 
the 
army. 
Behind,
before, 
and 
on 
both 
sides, 
crowds 
of 
militiamen 
with 
bared 
heads 
walked,
ran, 
and 
bowed 
to 
the 
ground.

At 
the 
summit 
of 
the 
hill 
they 
stopped 
with 
the 
icon; 
the 
men 
who 
had
been 
holding 
it 
up 
by 
the 
linen 
bands 
attached 
to 
it 
were 
relieved 
by
others, 
the 
chanters 
relit 
their 
censers, 
and 
service 
began. 
The 
hot
rays 
of 
the 
sun 
beat 
down 
vertically 
and 
a 
fresh 
soft 
wind 
played 
with
the 
hair 
of 
the 
bared 
heads 
and 
with 
the 
ribbons 
decorating 
the 
icon.
The 
singing 
did 
not 
sound 
loud 
under 
the 
open 
sky. 
An 
immense 
crowd
of 
bareheaded 
officers, 
soldiers, 
and 
militiamen 
surrounded 
the 
icon.
Behind 
the 
priest 
and 
a 
chanter 
stood 
the 
notabilities 
on 
a 
spot
reserved 
for 
them. 
A 
bald 
general 
with 
a 
St. 
George's 
Cross 
on 
his 
neck
stood 
just 
behind 
the 
priest's 
back, 
and 
without 
crossing 
himself 
(he
was 
evidently 
a 
German) 
patiently 
awaited 
the 
end 
of 
the 
service, 
which
he 
considered 
it 
necessary 
to 
hear 
to 
the 
end, 
probably 
to 
arouse 
the
patriotism 
of 
the 
Russian 
people. 
Another 
general 
stood 
in 
a 
martial
pose, 
crossing 
himself 
by 
shaking 
his 
hand 
in 
front 
of 
his 
chest
while 
looking 
about 
him. 
Standing 
among 
the 
crowd 
of 
peasants, 
Pierre
recognized
