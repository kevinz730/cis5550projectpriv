sat 
at 
the 
window, 
uneasily
watching 
the 
people 
who 
drove 
past 
and 
hurriedly 
glancing 
round 
at
anyone 
who 
entered 
the 
room. 
She 
was 
evidently 
expecting 
news 
of 
him 
and
that 
he 
would 
come 
or 
would 
write 
to 
her.

When 
the 
count 
came 
to 
see 
her 
she 
turned 
anxiously 
round 
at 
the 
sound
of 
a 
man's 
footstep, 
and 
then 
her 
face 
resumed 
its 
cold 
and 
malevolent
expression. 
She 
did 
not 
even 
get 
up 
to 
greet 
him. 
"What 
is 
the 
matter
with 
you, 
my 
angel? 
Are 
you 
ill?" 
asked 
the 
count.

After 
a 
moment's 
silence 
Natasha 
answered: 
"Yes, 
ill."

In 
reply 
to 
the 
count's 
anxious 
inquiries 
as 
to 
why 
she 
was 
so 
dejected
and 
whether 
anything 
had 
happened 
to 
her 
betrothed, 
she 
assured 
him
that 
nothing 
had 
happened 
and 
asked 
him 
not 
to 
worry. 
Marya 
Dmitrievna
confirmed 
Natasha's 
assurances 
that 
<a href="/cZl/PK5ZUI0EXJo9ON.html">nothing</a> 
had 
happened. 
From
the 
pretense 
of 
illness, 
from 
his 
daughter's 
distress, 
and 
by 
the
embarrassed 
faces 
of 
Sonya 
and 
Marya 
Dmitrievna, 
the 
count 
saw 
clearly
that 
something 
had 
gone 
wrong 
during 
his 
absence, 
but 
it 
was 
so 
terrible
for 
him 
to 
think 
that 
anything 
disgraceful 
had 
happened 
to 
his 
beloved
daughter, 
and 
he 
so 
prized 
his 
own 
cheerful 
tranquillity, 
that 
he
avoided 
inquiries 
and 
tried 
to 
assure 
himself 
that 
nothing 
particularly
had 
happened; 
and 
he 
was 
only 
dissatisfied 
that 
her 
indisposition
delayed 
their 
return 
to 
the 
country.





CHAPTER 
XIX

From 
the 
day 
his 
wife 
arrived 
in 
Moscow 
Pierre 
had 
been 
intending 
to 
go
away 
somewhere, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
be 
near 
her. 
Soon 
after 
the 
Rostovs 
came
to 
Moscow 
the 
effect 
Natasha 
had 
on 
him 
made 
him 
hasten 
to 
carry 
out
his 
intention. 
He 
went 
to 
Tver 
to 
see 
<a href="/cZl/gJL59gcnoA4a.html">Joseph</a> 
Alexeevich's 
widow, 
who
had 
long 
since 
promised 
to 
hand 
over 
to 
him 
some 
papers 
of 
her 
deceased
husband's.

When 
he 
returned 
to 
Moscow 
Pierre 
was 
handed 
a 
letter 
from 
Marya
Dmitrievna 
asking 
him 
to 
come 
and 
see 
her 
on 
a 
matter 
of 
great
importance 
relating 
to 
Andrew 
Bolkonski 
and 
his 
betrothed. 
Pierre 
had
been 
avoiding 
Natasha 
because 
it 
seemed 
to 
him 
that 
his 
feeling 
for 
her
was 
stronger 
than 
a 
married 
man's<p>
should 
be 
for 
his 
friend's 
fiancee.
Yet 
some 
fate 
constantly 
threw 
them 
together.

"What 
can 
have 
happened? 
And 
what 
can 
they 
want 
with 
me?" 
thought 
he
as 
he 
dressed 
to 
go 
to 
Marya 
Dmitrievna's. 
"If 
only 
Prince 
Andrew 
would
hurry 
up 
and 
come 
and 
marry 
her!" 
thought 
he 
on 
his 
way 
to 
the 
house.

On 
the 
Tverskoy 
Boulevard 
a 
familiar 
voice 
called 
to 
him.

"Pierre! 
Been 
back 
long?" 
someone 
shouted. 
Pierre 
raised 
his 
head. 
In
a 
sleigh 
drawn 
by 
<a href="/aVzUge/HIM9vxtj60IgdEd.html">two</a> 
gray 
trotting-horses 
that 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rz63KSVyY0ws.html">were</a> 
bespattering 
the
dashboard 
with 
snow, 
Anatole 
and<p>
his 
constant 
companion 
Makarin 
dashed
past. 
Anatole 
was 
sitting 
upright 
in 
the 
classic 
pose 
of 
military
dandies, 
the 
lower 
part 
of 
his 
face 
hidden 
by 
his 
beaver 
collar 
and 
his
head 
slightly 
bent.
