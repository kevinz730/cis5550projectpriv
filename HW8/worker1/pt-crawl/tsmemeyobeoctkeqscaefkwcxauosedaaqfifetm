aghast.

"I 
hate 
you, 
I 
hate</h1>you! 
You're 
my 
enemy 
forever!" 
And 
Natasha
ran 
out 
of 
the 
room.

Natasha 
did 
not 
speak 
to 
Sonya 
again 
and 
avoided 
her. 
With 
the 
same
expression 
of 
agitated 
surprise 
and 
guilt 
she 
went 
about 
the<p>
house,
taking 
up 
now 
one 
occupation, 
now 
another, 
and<p>
at 
once 
abandoning 
them.

Hard 
as 
it 
was 
for 
Sonya, 
she 
watched 
her 
friend 
and 
did 
not 
let 
her
out 
of 
her 
sight.

The 
day 
before 
the 
count 
was 
to 
return, 
Sonya 
noticed 
that 
Natasha 
sat
by 
the 
drawing 
room 
window 
all 
the 
morning 
as 
if 
expecting 
something 
and
that 
she 
made 
a 
sign 
to 
an 
officer 
who 
drove 
past, 
whom 
Sonya 
took 
to
be 
Anatole.

Sonya 
began 
watching 
her 
friend 
still 
more 
attentively 
and 
noticed 
that
at 
dinner 
and 
all 
that 
evening 
Natasha 
was 
in 
a 
strange 
and 
unnatural
state. 
She 
answered 
questions 
at 
random, 
began 
sentences 
she 
did 
not
finish, 
and 
laughed 
at<p>
everything.

After 
tea 
Sonya 
noticed 
a 
housemaid 
at 
Natasha's 
door 
timidly
waiting 
to 
<a href="/cZl/IMv9i5SXnSa2fCtXF.html">let</a> 
her 
pass. 
She 
let 
the 
girl 
go 
in, 
and 
then 
listening 
at
the 
door 
learned 
that 
another 
letter 
had 
been 
delivered.

Then 
suddenly 
it 
became 
clear 
to 
Sonya 
that 
Natasha 
had 
some 
dreadful
plan 
for 
that 
evening. 
Sonya 
knocked 
at 
her 
door. 
Natasha 
did 
not 
let
her 
in.

"She 
will 
run 
away 
with 
him!" 
thought 
Sonya. 
"She 
is 
capable 
of
anything. 
There 
was 
something 
particularly 
pathetic 
and 
resolute 
in
her 
face 
today. 
She 
cried 
as 
she 
said 
good-by 
to 
Uncle," 
Sonya
remembered. 
"Yes, 
that's 
it, 
she 
means 
to 
elope 
with 
<a href="/aVzUge/ZS6fqZYy9oGGl7suxK.html">him,</a> 
<a href="/nocrawl/aVzUge/sM2lOZ38o.html">but
what</a> 
am 
I 
to 
do?" 
thought 
she, 
recalling 
all 
the 
signs 
that 
clearly
indicated 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ayy3vZzpo4i7MdWa.html">that</a> 
Natasha 
had 
some 
terrible 
intention. 
"The 
count 
is
away. 
What 
am 
I
