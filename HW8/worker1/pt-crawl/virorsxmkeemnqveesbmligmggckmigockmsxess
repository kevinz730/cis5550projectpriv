know, 
I 
am 
often 
afraid
that 
by 
not 
speaking 
of 
him" 
(she 
meant 
Prince 
Andrew) 
"for 
fear 
of 
not
doing 
justice 
to 
our 
feelings, 
we 
forget 
him."

Princess 
Mary 
sighed 
deeply 
and 
thereby 
acknowledged 
the 
justice 
of
Natasha's 
remark, 
but 
she 
did 
not 
express 
agreement 
in 
words.

"Is 
it 
possible 
to 
forget?" 
said 
she.

"It 
did 
me 
so 
much 
good 
to 
tell 
all 
about 
it 
today. 
It 
was 
hard 
and
painful, 
but 
good, 
very 
good!" 
said 
Natasha. 
"I 
am 
sure 
<a href="/cZl/Cw38mTUVM5WVP.html">he</a> 
really 
loved
him. 
That 
is 
why 
I 
told 
him... 
Was 
it 
all 
right?" 
<a href="/aVzUge/Oy5GCnw4J1.html">she</a> 
added, 
suddenly
blushing.

"To 
tell 
Pierre? 
Oh, 
yes. 
What 
a 
splendid 
man 
he 
is!" 
said 
Princess
Mary.

"Do 
you 
know, 
Mary..." 
Natasha 
suddenly 
said 
with 
a 
mischievous 
smile
such 
as 
Princess 
Mary 
had 
not 
seen 
on 
her 
<a href="/cZl/xt2OfLLj2l2l.html">face</a> 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
"he 
has
somehow 
grown 
so 
clean, 
smooth, 
and 
fresh-as 
if 
he 
had 
just 
come 
out 
of
a 
Russian 
bath; 
do 
you 
understand? 
Out 
of 
a 
moral 
bath. 
Isn't 
it 
true?"

"Yes," 
replied 
Princess 
Mary. 
"He 
has 
greatly 
improved."

"With 
a 
short 
coat 
and 
his 
hair 
cropped; 
just 
as 
if, 
well, 
just 
as 
if 
he
had 
come 
straight 
from 
the 
bath... 
Papa 
used 
to..."

"I 
understand 
why 
he"
