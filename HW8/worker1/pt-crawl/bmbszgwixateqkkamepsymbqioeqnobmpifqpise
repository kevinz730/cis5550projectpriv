"There</h1>it 
is!... 
It 
again!..." 
said 
Pierre 
to 
himself, 
and 
an
involuntary 
shudder 
ran 
down 
his 
spine. 
In 
the 
corporal's 
changed 
face,
in 
the 
sound 
of 
his 
voice, 
in 
the 
stirring 
and 
deafening 
noise 
of 
the
drums, 
he 
recognized 
that 
mysterious, 
callous 
force 
which 
compelled
people 
against 
their 
will 
to 
kill 
their 
fellow 
men-that 
force 
the 
effect
of 
which 
he 
had 
witnessed 
during 
the 
executions. 
To 
fear 
or 
to 
try 
to
escape 
that 
force, 
to 
address 
entreaties 
or 
exhortations 
to 
those 
who
served 
as 
its 
tools, 
was 
useless. 
Pierre 
knew 
this 
now. 
One 
had 
to 
wait
and 
endure. 
He 
did 
not 
again 
go 
to 
the 
sick
