was 
irritable.</h1>It 
seemed 
to 
her
that 
everybody 
knew 
about 
her 
disappointment 
and 
was 
laughing 
at 
her 
and
pitying 
her. 
Strong 
as 
was 
her 
inward<p>
grief, 
this 
wound 
to 
her 
vanity
intensified 
her 
misery.

Once 
she 
came 
to 
her 
mother, 
tried 
to 
say 
something, 
and 
suddenly 
began
to 
cry. 
Her 
tears 
were 
those 
of 
an 
offended 
child 
who 
does 
not 
know 
why
it 
is 
being 
punished.

The 
countess 
began 
to 
soothe 
Natasha, 
<a href="/aVzUge/pD9Vd5AyyZE3wUl.html">who</a> 
after 
first 
listening 
to 
her
mother's 
words, 
suddenly 
interrupted 
her:

"Leave 
off, 
Mamma! 
I 
don't 
think, 
and 
don't 
want 
to 
think 
about
it! 
He 
just<p>
came 
and 
then 
left 
off, 
left 
off...."

Her 
voice 
trembled, 
and 
she 
again 
nearly 
cried, 
but 
<a href="/cZl/We5Y7mAz4W.html">recovered</a> 
and 
went
on 
quietly:

"And 
<a href="/aVzUge/Dt5rq4kplH7ioN.html">I</a> 
don't 
at 
all 
want 
to 
get 
married. 
And 
I 
am 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/uFR4NuySF7U7.html">afraid</a> 
of 
him; 
I
have 
now 
become 
quite 
calm, 
quite 
calm."

The 
day 
after 
this 
conversation 
Natasha 
put 
on 
the 
old 
dress 
which
she 
knew 
had 
the 
peculiar 
property 
of 
conducing<p>
to 
cheerfulness 
in 
the
mornings, 
and 
that 
day 
she 
returned 
to 
the 
old 
way 
of 
life 
which 
she 
had
abandoned 
since 
the 
ball. 
Having 
finished 
her 
morning 
tea 
she 
went 
to
the 
ballroom, 
which 
she 
particularly 
liked 
for 
its 
loud 
resonance, 
and
began 
singing 
her 
solfeggio. 
When 
she 
had 
finished 
her 
first 
exercise
she 
stood 
still 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZLk5NDX6.html">room</a> 
and 
sang 
a 
musical 
phrase 
that
particularly 
pleased 
her. 
She 
listened 
joyfully 
(as 
though 
she 
had 
not
expected 
it) 
to 
the 
charm 
of 
the 
notes 
reverberating, 
filling 
the
whole 
empty 
ballroom, 
and 
slowly 
dying 
away; 
and 
all 
at 
once 
she 
felt
cheerful. 
"What's 
the 
good 
of<p>
making 
so 
much 
of 
it? 
Things 
are 
nice
as 
it 
is," 
she 
said 
to 
herself, 
and 
she 
began 
walking 
up 
and 
down 
the
room, 
not<p>
stepping 
simply 
on 
the 
resounding 
parquet 
but 
treading 
with
each 
step 
from 
the 
heel 
to 
the 
toe 
(she 
had 
on 
a 
new 
and 
favorite 
pair
of 
shoes) 
and 
listening 
to 
the 
regular 
tap 
of 
the 
heel 
and 
creak 
of
the 
toe 
as 
gladly 
as 
she 
had 
to 
the 
sounds 
of 
her 
own 
voice. 
Passing

mirror
