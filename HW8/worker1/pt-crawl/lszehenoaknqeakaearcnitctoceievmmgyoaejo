ask 
how 
monsieur 
explains
the 
18th</h1>Brumaire; 
was 
not 
that 
an 
imposture? 
It 
was 
a 
swindle, 
and 
not
at 
all 
like 
the 
conduct 
of 
a 
great 
man!"

"And 
the 
prisoners 
he 
killed 
in 
Africa? 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/wK6Uo7V8.html">That</a> 
was 
horrible!" 
said 
the
little 
princess, 
shrugging 
her<p>
shoulders.

"He's 
a 
low 
fellow, 
say 
what 
you 
will," 
remarked 
Prince 
Hippolyte.

Pierre, 
not 
knowing 
whom 
to 
answer, 
looked 
at 
them 
all 
and 
smiled. 
His
smile 
was 
unlike 
the 
half-smile 
of 
other 
people. 
When 
he 
smiled,
his 
grave, 
even 
rather 
gloomy, 
look<p>
was 
instantaneously 
replaced 
by
another-a 
childlike, 
kindly, 
even 
rather 
silly 
look, 
which 
seemed 
to
ask 
forgiveness.

The 
vicomte 
who 
was 
meeting 
him 
for 
the 
first 
time 
saw 
clearly 
that
this 
young 
Jacobin 
was 
not 
so 
terrible 
as 
his 
words 
suggested. 
All 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cf1m55yf.html">were
silent.

"How</a> 
do<p>
you 
expect 
him 
to 
answer 
you 
all 
at 
once?" 
said<p>
Prince
Andrew. 
"Besides, 
in 
the 
actions 
of 
a 
statesman 
one 
has 
to 
distinguish
between 
his 
acts 
as 
a 
private 
person, 
as 
a 
general, 
and 
as 
an 
emperor.
So 
it 
seems 
to 
me."

"Yes, 
yes, 
<a href="/aVzUge/aA9LQqh5rIdLP0.html">of</a> 
course!" 
Pierre 
chimed 
in, 
pleased 
at 
the 
arrival 
of
this 
reinforcement.

"One 
must 
admit," 
continued 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"that 
Napoleon 
as 
a 
man
was 
great 
on 
the 
bridge 
of 
Arcola, 
and 
in 
the 
hospital 
at 
Jaffa 
where 
he
gave 
his 
hand 
to 
the 
plague-stricken; 
but 
... 
but 
there 
are 
other 
acts
which 
it 
is 
difficult 
to 
justify."

Prince 
Andrew, 
who 
had 
evidently 
wished 
to 
tone 
down 
the 
awkwardness 
of
Pierre's 
remarks, 
rose 
and 
made 
a 
sign 
to 
his 
wife 
that 
it 
was 
time 
to
go.

Suddenly 
Prince 
Hippolyte 
started 
up 
making 
signs 
to 
everyone 
to 
attend,
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/CE6QD8yG5z.html">asking</a> 
them 
all 
to 
be 
seated 
began:

"I 
was 
told 
a 
charming 
Moscow 
story 
today 
and 
must 
treat 
you 
to 
it.
Excuse 
me, 
Vicomte-I 
must 
tell 
it 
in 
Russian 
or 
the 
point 
will 
be
lost...." 
And 
Prince 
Hippolyte 
began 
to 
tell 
his 
story 
in 
such 
Russian
as 
a 
Frenchman 
would 
speak 
after 
spending 
about 
a 
year 
in 
Russia.
Everyone 
waited, 
so 
emphatically 
and 
eagerly 
did 
he 
demand 
their
attention 
to 
his 
story.

"There 
is 
in 
Moscow 
a 
lady, 
une 
dame, 
and 
she 
is 
very 
stingy. 
She 
must
have 
two 
footmen 
behind 
her 
carriage, 
and 
very 
big 
ones.<p>
That 
was 
her
taste. 
And 
she 
had 
a 
lady's 
maid, 
also 
big. 
She 
said...."

Here 
Prince 
Hippolyte 
paused, 
evidently 
collecting 
his 
ideas 
with
difficulty.

"She 
said.... 
Oh 
yes! 
She 
said, 
'Girl,' 
to 
the 
maid, 
'put 
on 
a
livery, 
get 
up 
behind 
the 
carriage, 
and 
come 
with 
me 
while 
I 
make 
some
calls.'"

Here 
Prince 
Hippolyte 
spluttered 
and 
burst 
out 
laughing 
long 
before 
his
audience, 
which 
produced 
an 
effect 
unfavorable 
to 
the 
narrator. 
Several
persons, 
among 
them 
the 
elderly 
lady 
and 
Anna 
Pavlovna, 
did 
however
smile.

"She 
went. 
Suddenly 
there 
was 
a 
great 
wind. 
The 
girl 
lost 
her 
hat 
and
her 
long 
hair 
came 
down...." 
Here 
he 
could 
contain 
himself 
no
longer 
and 
went 
on, 
between 
gasps 
of 
laughter: 
"And 
the 
whole 
world
knew...."

And 
so 
the 
anecdote 
ended. 
Though 
it 
was 
unintelligible 
why 
he 
had 
told
it, 
or 
why 
it 
had 
to 
be 
told 
in 
Russian, 
still 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
and 
the
others 
appreciated 
Prince 
Hippolyte's 
social 
tact 
in 
so 
agreeably
ending 
Pierre's 
unpleasant 
and 
unamiable 
outburst. 
After 
the 
anecdote
the 
conversation 
broke 
up 
into 
insignificant 
small 
talk 
about 
the 
last
and 
next 
balls, 
about 
theatricals, 
and 
who 
would 
meet 
whom, 
and 
<a href="/cZl/xN150Ptam.html">when</a> 
and
where.
