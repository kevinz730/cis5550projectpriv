two
thousand 
men 
breathlessly 
gazing 
at 
him 
and 
the 
regimental 
commander 
did
not 
exist.

The 
word 
of 
command 
rang 
out, 
and 
again 
the 
regiment 
quivered, 
as 
with 
a
jingling 
sound 
it 
presented 
arms. 
Then 
amidst

dead 
silence<p>
the
feeble 
voice 
of 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
was 
heard. 
The 
regiment 
roared,
"Health 
to 
your 
ex... 
len... 
len... 
lency!" 
and 
again 
all 
became
silent.
