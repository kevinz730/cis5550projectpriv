"Oo-oo, 
my 
beauty!" 
exclaimed 
the 
count, 
"she 
looks 
better 
than
any 
of 
you!"

He<p>
would 
have 
embraced 
her 
but, 
blushing, 
she 
stepped 
aside 
fearing<p>
to
be 
rumpled.

"Mamma, 
your 
cap, 
more 
to 
this 
side," 
said 
Natasha. 
"I'll
arrange 
it," 
and 
she 
rushed 
forward 
so 
that 
the 
maids 
who 
were 
tacking
up 
her 
skirt 
could 
not 
move 
fast 
enough 
and 
a 
piece 
of 
gauze 
was 
torn
off.

"Oh 
goodness! 
What 
has 
happened? 
Really 
it 
was 
not 
my 
fault!"

"Never 
mind, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/JM35pufMC1SUDH.html">I'll</a> 
run 
it 
up, 
it 
won't 
show," 
said 
Dunyasha.

"What 
a 
beauty-a 
very 
queen!" 
said 
the 
nurse 
as 
she 
came 
to 
the
door. 
"And 
Sonya! 
They 
are 
lovely!"

At 
a 
quarter 
past 
ten 
they 
at 
last 
got 
into 
their 
carriages 
and 
started.
But 
they 
had 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ja5U2WMYlo.html">still</a> 
to 
call 
at 
the 
Taurida 
Gardens.

Peronskaya 
was 
quite 
ready. 
In 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/AS9eaK0z3.html">spite</a> 
of 
her 
age 
and 
plainness 
she
had 
gone 
<a href="/cZl/CW6Jn88yG.html">through</a> 
the 
same 
process 
as 
the 
Rostovs, 
but 
with 
less
flurry-for 
to 
her 
it 
was<p>
a 
matter 
of 
routine. 
Her 
ugly 
old 
body 
was
washed, 
perfumed, 
and 
powdered 
in 
just 
the 
same 
way. 
She 
had 
washed
behind 
her 
ears 
<a href="/cZl/YX7EI2NX7.html">just</a> 
as 
carefully, 
and 
when 
she 
entered 
her 
drawing
room 
in 
her 
yellow 
dress, 
wearing 
her 
badge 
as 
maid 
of 
honor, 
her 
old
lady's 
maid 
was 
as 
full 
of 
rapturous 
admiration 
as 
the 
Rostovs'
servants 
had 
been.

She 
praised 
the 
Rostovs' 
toilets. 
They 
praised 
her 
taste 
and 
toilet,
and 
at 
eleven 
o'clock, 
careful 
of 
their 
coiffures 
and 
dresses, 
they
settled 
themselves 
in 
their 
carriages 
and 
drove 
off.





CHAPTER 
XV

Natasha 
had 
not 
had 
a 
moment 
free 
since 
early 
morning 
and 
had 
not 
once
had 
time 
to 
think 
of 
what 
lay 
before 
her.

In 
the 
damp 
chill 
air 
and 
crowded 
closeness 
of 
the 
swaying 
carriage, 
she
for 
the 
first 
time 
vividly 
imagined 
what 
was 
in 
store 
for 
her 
there 
at
the 
ball, 
in 
those 
brightly 
lighted 
rooms-with 
music, 
flowers, 
dances,
the 
Emperor, 
and 
all 
the 
brilliant 
young 
people 
of 
Petersburg. 
The
prospect 
was 
so 
splendid 
that 
she 
hardly 
believed 
it 
would 
come 
true,
so 
out 
of 
keeping 
was 
it 
with 
the 
chill 
darkness 
and 
closeness 
of 
the
carriage. 
She 
understood 
all 
that 
awaited 
her 
only 
when, 
after 
stepping
over 
the 
red 
baize 
at 
the 
entrance, 
she 
entered 
the 
hall, 
took 
off 
her
fur 
cloak, 
and, 
beside 
Sonya 
and 
in 
front 
of 
her 
mother, 
mounted
