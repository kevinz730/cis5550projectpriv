by 
the
Freemasons. 
He 
felt 
like 
a 
man 
who 
after 
straining 
his 
eyes 
to 
see 
into
the 
far 
distance 
finds 
what 
he 
sought 
at 
his 
very 
feet. 
All 
his 
life
he 
had 
looked 
over 
the 
heads 
of 
the 
men 
around 
him, 
when 
he 
should 
have
merely 
looked 
in 
front 
of 
him 
without 
straining 
his 
eyes.

In 
the 
past<p>
he 
had 
never 
been 
able 
to 
find 
that 
great 
inscrutable
infinite 
something. 
He 
had 
only 
felt 
that 
it 
must 
exist 
somewhere<p>
and
had 
looked 
for 
it.<p>
In 
everything 
near 
and 
comprehensible 
he 
had 
seen
only 
what 
was 
limited, 
petty, 
commonplace, 
and 
senseless. 
He 
had
equipped 
himself 
with 
a 
mental 
telescope 
and 
looked 
into 
remote 
space,
where 
petty 
worldliness 
hiding 
itself 
in 
misty 
distance 
had 
seemed 
to
him 
great 
and 
infinite 
merely 
because 
it 
was 
not 
clearly 
seen. 
And 
such
had 
European 
life, 
politics, 
Freemasonry, 
philosophy, 
and 
philanthropy
seemed 
to 
him. 
But 
even 
then, 
at 
moments 
of 
weakness 
as 
he 
had 
accounted
them, 
his 
mind 
had 
penetrated 
to 
those 
distances 
and 
he 
had 
there 
seen
the 
same 
pettiness, 
worldliness, 
and 
senselessness. 
Now, 
however, 
he
had 
learned 
to 
see 
the 
great, 
eternal, 
and 
infinite 
in 
everything, 
and
therefore-to 
see<p>
it 
and 
enjoy 
its 
contemplation-he 
naturally 
threw 
away
the 
telescope 
through 
which 
he 
had 
till 
now 
gazed 
over 
men's 
heads, 
and
gladly 
regarded 
the 
ever-changing, 
eternally 
great, 
unfathomable, 
and
infinite 
life 
around 
him. 
And 
the 
closer 
he 
looked 
the 
more 
tranquil 
and
happy 
he 
became. 
That 
dreadful 
question, 
"What 
for?" 
which 
had 
formerly
destroyed 
all 
his 
mental 
edifices, 
no 
longer 
existed 
for 
him. 
To 
that
question, 
<a href="/aVzUge/oC2mo4bvg3.html">"What</a> 
for?" 
a 
simple 
answer 
was 
now 
always 
ready 
in 
his 
soul:
"Because 
there 
is 
a 
God, 
that 
God 
without 
whose 
will 
not<p>
one 
hair 
falls
from 
a 
man's 
head."





CHAPTER 
XIII

In 
external 
ways 
Pierre 
had 
hardly 
changed 
at 
all. 
In 
appearance 
he
was 
just 
what 
he 
used 
to 
be. 
As 
before 
he 
was 
absent-minded 
and 
seemed
occupied 
not 
with 
what 
was 
before 
his 
eyes 
but 
with 
something 
special
of 
his 
own. 
The 
difference 
between 
his 
former 
and 
present 
self 
was 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Wb49N5l.html">that
formerly</a> 
when 
he 
did 
not 
grasp 
what 
lay 
before 
him 
or 
was 
said 
<a href="/cZl/uI3zT3Dj7dS.html">to
him,</a> 
he 
had 
puckered 
his 
forehead 
painfully 
as 
if 
vainly 
seeking 
to
distinguish 
something 
at 
a 
distance. 
At 
present 
he 
still 
forgot 
what 
was
said 
to 
him 
and 
still
