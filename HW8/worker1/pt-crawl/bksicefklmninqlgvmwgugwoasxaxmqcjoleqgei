CHAPTER 
VIII

One 
would 
have 
thought 
that 
under 
the 
almost 
incredibly 
wretched
conditions 
the 
Russian 
soldiers 
were 
in 
at 
that 
time-lacking 
warm 
boots
and 
sheepskin 
coats, 
without 
a 
<a href="/cZl/RG4i8J0A.html">roof</a> 
over 
their 
heads, 
in 
the 
snow
with 
eighteen 
degrees 
of 
frost, 
and 
without 
even 
full 
rations 
(the
commissariat 
did 
not 
always 
keep 
up 
with 
the 
troops)-they 
would 
have
presented 
a 
very 
<a href="/cZl/CK3YIp8qRU2.html">sad</a> 
and 
depressing 
spectacle.

On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
army 
had 
never 
under 
the 
best 
material 
conditions
presented 
a 
more 
cheerful 
and 
animated 
aspect. 
This 
was 
because 
all 
who
began 
to 
grow 
depressed 
or 
who 
lost 
strength 
were 
sifted 
out 
of 
the 
army
day 
by 
day. 
All 
the 
physically 
or 
morally 
weak 
had 
long 
since 
been 
left
behind 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/cF9JCLL4k6.html">only</a> 
the 
flower 
of 
the 
army-physically 
and 
mentally-remained.

More 
men 
collected 
behind 
the 
wattle 
fence 
of 
the 
Eighth 
Company 
than
anywhere 
else. 
Two 
sergeants 
major 
were 
sitting 
<a href="/cZl/Qz4XZEHJ3wvJ1Sdo.html">with</a> 
them 
and 
their
campfire 
blazed 
brighter 
than 
others. 
For 
leave 
to 
sit 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cp7Ufz6ClqSz.html">by</a> 
their 
wattle
they 
demanded 
contributions 
of 
fuel.

"Eh, 
Makeev! 
What 
has 
become 
of 
you, 
you 
son 
of 
a 
bitch? 
Are 
you 
lost 
or
have 
the 
wolves 
eaten 
you? 
Fetch 
some 
more 
wood!" 
shouted 
a 
red-haired
and 
red-faced 
man, 
screwing 
up 
his 
eyes 
and 
blinking 
because 
of 
the
smoke 
but 
not 
moving 
back 
from 
the 
fire. 
"And 
you, 
Jackdaw, 
go 
and 
fetch
some 
wood!" 
said 
he 
to 
another 
soldier.

This 
red-haired 
man 
was 
neither 
a 
sergeant 
nor 
a 
corporal, 
but 
being
robust 
he 
ordered 
about 
those 
weaker 
than 
himself. 
The 
soldier
they 
called 
"Jackdaw," 
a 
thin 
little 
fellow 
with 
a 
sharp 
nose, 
rose
obediently 
and 
was 
about 
to 
go 
but 
at 
that 
instant 
there 
came 
into
the 
light 
of 
the 
fire 
the 
slender, 
handsome 
figure 
of 
a 
young 
soldier
carrying 
a 
load 
of 
wood.

"Bring 
it 
here-that's 
fine!"

They 
split 
up 
the 
wood, 
pressed 
it 
down 
on 
the 
fire, 
blew 
at 
it 
with
their 
mouths, 
and 
fanned 
it 
with 
the 
skirts 
of 
their 
greatcoats, 
making
the 
flames 
hiss 
and 
crackle. 
The 
men 
drew 
nearer 
and 
lit 
their 
pipes.
The 
handsome 
young 
soldier 
who 
had 
brought 
the 
wood, 
setting 
his 
arms
akimbo, 
began 
stamping 
his 
cold 
feet 
rapidly 
and 
deftly 
on 
the 
spot
where 
he 
stood.

"Mother! 
The 
dew 
is 
cold 
but 
clear.... 
It's 
well 
that 
I'm 
a
musketeer..." 
he 
sang, 
pretending 
to 
hiccough 
after
