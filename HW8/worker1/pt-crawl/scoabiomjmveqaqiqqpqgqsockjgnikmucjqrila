bid 
good-by 
to
the 
young 
prince. 
The 
members 
of 
the 
household 
were 
all 
gathered 
in 
the
reception 
hall: 
Michael 
Ivanovich, 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
Princess
Mary, 
and 
the 
little 
princess. 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
been 
called 
to 
his
father's 
study 
as 
the 
latter 
wished 
to 
say 
good-by 
to 
him 
alone. 
All
were 
waiting<p>
for 
them 
to 
come 
out.

When 
Prince 
Andrew 
entered 
the 
study 
the 
old 
man 
in 
his 
old-age
spectacles 
and 
white 
dressing 
gown, 
in 
which 
<a href="/aVzUge/EX9s94vSr.html">he</a> 
received 
no 
one 
but 
his
son, 
sat 
at 
the 
table 
writing. 
He 
glanced 
round.

"Going?" 
And 
he 
went 
on 
writing.

"I've 
come 
to 
say 
good-by."

"Kiss 
me 
here," 
and 
he 
touched 
his 
cheek: 
"Thanks, 
thanks!"

"What 
do 
you 
thank 
me 
for?"

"For 
not 
dilly-dallying 
and 
not 
hanging 
to 
a 
woman's 
apron 
strings.
The 
Service 
before 
everything. 
Thanks, 
thanks!" 
And 
he 
went 
on
writing, 
so 
that 
his 
quill 
spluttered 
and 
squeaked. 
"If 
you 
have
anything 
to 
say, 
say 
it. 
These 
two 
things 
can 
be 
done 
together,"<p>
he
added.

"About 
my 
wife... 
I 
am 
ashamed 
as 
it 
is 
to 
leave 
her 
on 
your
hands...."

"Why 
talk 
nonsense? 
Say 
what 
you 
want."

"When 
her 
confinement 
is 
due, 
send 
to 
Moscow 
for 
an 
accoucheur.... 
Let
him 
be 
here...."

The 
old 
prince 
stopped 
writing 
and,<p>
as 
if 
not 
understanding, 
fixed 
his
stern 
eyes 
on 
his 
son.

"I 
know 
that 
no 
one 
can 
help 
if 
nature 
does 
not 
do 
her 
work," 
said
Prince 
Andrew, 
evidently 
confused. 
"I 
know 
that 
out 
of 
a 
million
cases 
only 
one 
goes 
wrong, 
but 
it 
is 
her 
fancy 
and 
mine. 
They 
have 
been
telling 
her 
things. 
She 
has 
had 
a 
dream 
and 
is 
frightened."

"Hm... 
Hm..." 
muttered 
the 
old 
prince 
to 
himself, 
<a href="/cZl/iY9T0hyP6qd.html">finishing</a> 
what 
he
was 
writing. 
"I'll 
do 
it."

He 
signed 
with 
a 
flourish 
and 
suddenly 
turning 
to 
his 
son 
began 
to
laugh.

"It's 
a 
bad 
business, 
eh?"

"What 
is 
bad, 
Father?"

"The 
wife!" 
said 
the 
old 
prince, 
briefly 
and 
significantly.

"I 
don't 
understand!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew.

"No, 
it 
can't 
be 
helped, 
lad," 
said 
the 
<a href="/cZl/lg7mk5rqw7Yg.html">prince.</a> 
"They're
all 
like 
that; 
one 
can't 
unmarry. 
Don't 
be 
afraid; 
I 
won't 
tell
anyone, 
but 
you 
know 
it 
yourself."

He 
seized 
his 
son 
by 
the 
hand 
with 
small 
bony 
fingers, 
shook 
it, 
looked
straight 
into 
his 
son's 
face 
with 
keen 
eyes 
which 
seemed 
to 
see
through 
him, 
and 
again 
laughed 
his 
frigid 
laugh.

The 
son 
sighed, 
thus 
admitting 
that 
his 
father 
had 
understood 
him. 
The
old 
man 
continued 
to 
fold 
and 
seal 
his 
letter, 
snatching 
up 
and 
throwing
down 
the 
wax, 
the 
seal, 
and 
the 
paper, 
with 
his<p>
accustomed 
rapidity.

"What's 
to 
be 
done? 
She's 
pretty! 
I 
will 
do 
everything. 
Make 
your
mind 
easy," 
said 
he 
in 
abrupt 
sentences 
while 
sealing 
his 
letter.

Andrew 
did 
not 
speak; 
he 
was 
both 
pleased 
and 
displeased 
that 
his 
father
understood 
him. 
The 
old 
man 
got 
up 
and 
gave 
the 
letter 
to 
his 
son.

"Listen!" 
said 
he; 
"don't 
worry 
about 
your
