followed
on</h1>the 
arm 
of 
a 
colonel 
of 
hussars, 
a 
man 
of 
importance 
to 
them 
because
Nicholas 
was 
to 
go 
with 
him 
to 
the 
regiment; 
then 
came 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna
with 
Shinshin. 
Berg 
gave 
his 
arm 
to 
Vera. 
The 
smiling 
Julie 
Karagina
went 
in 
with 
Nicholas. 
After 
them 
other 
couples 
followed, 
filling 
the
whole 
dining 
hall, 
and 
last 
of 
all 
the 
children, 
tutors, 
and 
governesses
followed 
singly. 
The 
footmen 
began 
moving 
about, 
chairs 
scraped, 
the
band 
struck 
up 
in 
the 
gallery, 
and 
the 
guests 
settled 
down 
in 
their
places. 
Then 
the 
strains 
of 
the 
count's 
household 
band 
were 
replaced
by 
<a href="/cZl/kz9z45.html">the</a> 
clatter 
of 
knives 
and 
forks, 
the 
voices 
of 
visitors, 
and 
the
soft 
steps 
of 
the 
footmen. 
At 
one 
end 
of 
the 
table 
sat 
the 
countess 
with
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
on 
her 
right 
and 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
on 
her 
left, 
the
other 
lady 
visitors 
were 
farther 
down. 
At 
the 
other 
end<p>
sat 
the 
count,
with 
the 
hussar 
colonel 
on 
his 
left 
and 
Shinshin 
and 
the 
other 
male
visitors 
on 
his 
right. 
Midway 
down 
the 
long 
table 
on 
one 
side 
sat 
the
grown-up 
young 
people: 
Vera 
beside 
Berg, 
and<p>
Pierre 
beside 
Boris; 
and
on 
the 
other 
side, 
the 
children, 
tutors, 
and 
governesses. 
From 
behind
the 
crystal 
decanters 
and 
fruit 
vases, 
the 
count 
kept 
glancing 
at 
his
wife 
and 
her 
tall 
cap 
with 
its 
light-blue 
ribbons, 
and 
busily 
filled
his 
<a href="/cZl/ka4i7GFXfk5.html">neighbors'</a> 
glasses, 
not 
neglecting 
his 
own. 
The 
countess 
in 
turn,
without 
omitting 
her 
duties 
as 
hostess, 
threw 
significant 
glances 
from
behind 
the 
pineapples 
at 
her 
husband 
whose 
face 
and 
bald 
head 
seemed
by 
their 
redness 
to 
contrast 
more 
than 
usual 
with 
his 
gray 
hair. 
At 
the
ladies' 
end 
an 
even 
chatter 
of 
voices 
was 
heard 
all 
the 
time, 
at 
the
men's 
end 
the 
voices 
sounded 
louder 
and 
louder, 
especially 
that 
of 
the
colonel 
of 
hussars 
who, 
growing 
more 
and 
more 
flushed, 
ate 
and 
drank 
so
much 
that 
the 
count 
held 
him 
up 
as 
a 
pattern 
to 
the 
other 
guests.
