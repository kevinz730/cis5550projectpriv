I 
am 
sorry 
for
her, 
and 
sometimes 
I 
think 
she 
doesn't 
feel 
it 
as 
you 
or 
I 
would."

Though 
Countess 
Mary 
told 
Natasha 
that 
those 
words 
in 
the 
Gospel 
must 
be
understood 
differently, 
yet 
looking 
at 
Sonya 
she 
agreed 
with 
Natasha's
explanation. 
It 
really 
seemed 
that 
Sonya 
did 
not 
feel 
her 
position
trying, 
and 
had 
grown 
quite 
reconciled 
to 
her 
lot 
as 
a 
sterile 
flower.
She 
seemed 
to 
be 
fond 
not 
so 
much 
of 
individuals 
as 
of 
the 
family 
as 
a
whole. 
Like 
a 
cat, 
she 
had 
attached 
herself 
not 
to 
the 
people 
but 
to 
the
home. 
She 
waited 
on 
the 
old 
countess, 
petted 
and 
spoiled 
the 
children,
was 
always 
ready 
to 
render 
the 
small 
services 
for 
which 
she 
had 
a 
gift,
and 
all 
this 
was 
unconsciously 
accepted 
from 
her 
with 
insufficient
gratitude.

The 
country<p>
seat 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
had 
been 
rebuilt, 
though 
not 
on 
the 
same
scale 
as 
under 
the 
old 
prince.

The 
buildings, 
begun 
under 
straitened 
circumstances, 
were 
more 
than
simple. 
The 
immense 
house 
on 
the 
old 
stone 
foundations 
was 
of 
wood,
plastered 
only 
inside. 
It 
had 
bare 
deal 
floors 
and 
was 
furnished 
with
very 
simple 
hard 
sofas, 
armchairs, 
tables, 
and 
chairs 
made 
by 
their 
own
serf 
carpenters 
out 
of 
their 
own 
birchwood. 
The 
house 
was 
spacious
and 
had 
rooms 
for 
the 
house<p>
serfs 
and 
apartments 
for 
visitors. 
Whole
families 
of 
the 
Rostovs' 
and 
Bolkonskis' 
relations 
sometimes 
came 
to
Bald 
Hills 
with 
sixteen 
horses 
and 
dozens 
of 
servants 
and 
stayed 
for
months. 
Besides 
that, 
four 
times 
a 
year, 
on 
the 
name 
days 
and 
birthdays
of 
the 
hosts, 
as 
many 
as 
a 
hundred 
visitors 
would 
gather 
there 
for 
a 
day
or 
two. 
The 
rest 
of 
the 
year 
life 
pursued 
its 
unbroken 
routine 
with 
its
ordinary 
occupations, 
and 
its 
breakfasts, 
lunches, 
dinners, 
and 
suppers,
provided 
out 
of 
the 
produce 
of 
the 
estate.





CHAPTER 
IX

It 
was 
the 
eve 
of 
St. 
Nicholas, 
the 
fifth 
of 
December, 
1820. 
Natasha 
had
been 
staying 
at 
her 
brother's 
with 
her 
husband 
and 
children 
since 
early
autumn. 
Pierre 
had 
gone 
to 
Petersburg 
on 
business 
of 
his 
own 
for 
three
weeks 
as 
he 
said, 
but 
had 
remained 
there 
nearly 
seven 
weeks 
and 
was
expected 
back 
every 
minute.

Besides 
the 
Bezukhov 
family, 
Nicholas' 
old 
friend 
the 
retired 
General
Vasili 
Dmitrich 
Denisov 
was 
staying 
with 
the 
Rostovs 
this 
fifth 
of
December.

On 
the 
sixth, 
which 
was 
his 
name 
day 
when 
the 
house 
would 
be 
full 
of
visitors, 
Nicholas 
knew 
he 
would 
have 
to 
exchange 
his 
Tartar 
tunic 
for
a 
tail 
coat, 
and 
put 
on 
narrow 
boots 
with<p>
pointed 
toes, 
and 
drive 
to
the 
new 
church 
he 
had 
built, 
and 
then 
receive 
visitors 
who 
would 
come 
to
congratulate 
him, 
offer 
them 
refreshments, 
and 
talk 
about 
the 
elections
of 
the 
nobility; 
but 
he 
considered 
himself 
entitled 
to 
spend 
the 
eve
of 
that 
day 
in 
his 
usual 
way. 
He 
examined 
the 
bailiff's 
accounts 
of
the 
village 
in 
Ryazan 
which 
<a href="/cZl/Zdn31xHdu.html">belonged</a> 
to 
his 
wife's 
nephew, 
wrote 
two
business 
letters, 
and
