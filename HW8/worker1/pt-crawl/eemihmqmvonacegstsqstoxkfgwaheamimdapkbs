But 
I 
replied 
that
I<p>
should 
be 
ashamed 
to 
do 
it, 
and 
suddenly 
everything 
vanished. 
And 
I
awoke 
and 
found 
in 
my 
mind 
the 
text 
from 
the 
Gospel: 
"The 
life 
was
the 
light 
of 
men. 
And 
the 
light 
shineth 
in 
darkness; 
and 
the 
darkness
comprehended 
it 
not." 
Joseph 
Alexeevich's 
face 
had 
looked 
young
and 
bright. 
That 
day 
I 
received 
a 
letter 
from 
my 
benefactor 
in 
which 
he
wrote 
about 
"conjugal 
duties."


9th 
December

I 
had 
a 
dream 
from 
which 
I 
awoke<p>
with 
a 
throbbing 
heart. 
I 
saw 
that
I 
was 
in 
Moscow 
in 
my 
house, 
in 
the 
big 
sitting 
room, 
and 
Joseph
Alexeevich 
came 
in 
from 
the 
drawing 
room. 
<a href="/cZl/CS7GLq8IDLzm4oOe.html">I</a> 
seemed 
to 
know 
at 
once 
that
the 
process 
of 
regeneration 
had 
already 
taken 
place 
in 
him, 
and 
I 
rushed
to 
meet 
him. 
I 
embraced 
him 
and 
kissed 
his 
hands, 
and 
he 
said, 
"Hast
thou 
noticed 
that 
my 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mS2fY5hQrxS8OgAj.html">face</a> 
is 
different?" 
I 
looked 
at 
him, 
still
holding 
him 
in 
my 
arms, 
and 
saw 
that 
his 
face 
was 
young, 
but 
that 
he
had 
no 
hair 
on 
his 
head 
and 
his 
features 
were 
quite 
changed. 
And<p>
I 
said,
"I 
should 
have 
known 
you 
had 
I 
met 
you 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oUZ59J1bI.html">by</a> 
chance," 
and 
I 
thought 
to
myself, 
"Am 
I 
telling<p>
the 
truth?" 
And 
suddenly 
I 
saw 
him 
lying 
like
a 
dead 
body; 
then 
he 
gradually 
recovered 
and 
went 
with 
me 
into 
my 
study
carrying 
a 
large 
book 
of 
sheets 
of 
drawing 
paper; 
I 
said, 
"I 
drew
that," 
and 
he 
answered 
by 
bowing 
his 
head. 
I 
opened 
the 
book, 
and 
on
all 
the 
pages 
there 
were 
excellent 
drawings. 
And 
in 
my 
dream 
I 
knew
that 
these 
drawings 
represented 
the 
love 
adventures 
of 
the 
soul 
with 
its
beloved. 
And 
on 
its 
pages 
I 
saw 
a 
beautiful 
representation 
of 
a 
maiden
in 
transparent 
garments 
and 
with 
a 
transparent 
body, 
<a href="/cZl/Nh5xp2dAJUS8dJM.html">flying</a> 
up<p>
to 
the
clouds. 
And 
I 
seemed 
to 
know 
that 
this 
maiden 
was 
nothing 
else 
than 
a
representation 
of 
the 
Song 
of 
Songs. 
And 
looking 
at 
those 
drawings 
I
dreamed 
I 
felt 
that 
I 
was 
doing 
wrong, 
but 
could 
not 
tear 
myself 
away
from 
them. 
Lord, 
help 
me! 
My 
God, 
if<p>
Thy 
forsaking 
me 
is 
Thy 
doing, 
Thy
will 
be 
done; 
but 
if 
I 
am 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/WU8DbPtL3As.html">myself</a> 
the 
cause, 
teach 
me 
what 
I 
should 
do! 
I
shall 
perish 
of 
my 
debauchery 
if 
Thou 
utterly 
desertest 
me!





CHAPTER 
XI

The 
Rostovs' 
monetary 
affairs 
had 
not 
improved 
during 
the 
two 
years
they 
had 
spent 
in 
the 
country.

Though 
Nicholas 
Rostov 
had 
kept 
firmly 
to 
his<p>
resolution 
and 
was 
still
serving 
modestly 
in 
an 
obscure 
regiment, 
spending 
comparatively 
little,
the 
way 
of 
life 
at 
Otradnoe-Mitenka's 
management 
of 
affairs, 
in
particular-was 
such 
that 
the 
debts 
inevitably 
increased 
every 
year.
The 
only 
resource 
obviously 
presenting 
itself 
to 
the 
old 
count 
was 
to
apply 
for 
an 
official 
post, 
so 
he 
had 
come 
to 
Petersburg 
to 
look 
for 
one
and 
also, 
as 
he 
said, 
to 
let 
the 
lassies 
enjoy 
themselves 
for 
the 
last
time.

Soon 
after 
their 
arrival 
in 
Petersburg 
Berg 
proposed 
to 
Vera 
and 
was
accepted.

Though 
in 
Moscow 
the 
Rostovs 
belonged 
to 
the 
best 
society 
without
themselves 
giving 
it 
a 
thought, 
yet 
in 
Petersburg 
their 
circle 
of
acquaintances 
was 
a 
mixed 
and 
indefinite 
one. 
In 
Petersburg 
they 
were
provincials,
