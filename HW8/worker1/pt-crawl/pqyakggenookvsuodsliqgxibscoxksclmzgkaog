Alpatych
did 
say 
something 
about 
going.... 
Speak 
to 
him; 
I 
can 
do 
nothing,
nothing,

don't 
want

"I've 
spoken 
to 
him. 
He 
hopes 
we 
should 
be 
in 
time 
to 
get 
away 
tomorrow,
but 
I 
think 
it 
would 
now 
be 
better 
to 
stay 
here," 
said 
<a href="/aVzUge/vVJ9KpkPN4IEXzL1m.html">Mademoiselle
Bourienne.</a> 
"Because, 
you 
will 
agree, 
chere 
<a href="/aVzUge/eyx3up6ogArh0dcFeE.html">Marie,</a> 
to 
fall 
into 
the 
hands
of 
the 
soldiers 
or 
of 
riotous 
peasants 
would 
be 
terrible."

Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
took 
from 
her 
reticule 
a 
proclamation 
(not
printed 
on 
ordinary 
Russian 
paper) 
of 
General 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Cc3mGGRm7qQqw5.html">Rameau's,</a> 
telling 
people
not 
to 
leave 
their 
homes 
and 
that 
the 
French 
authorities 
would 
afford
them 
proper 
protection. 
She 
handed 
<a href="/nocrawl/aVzUge/WD1iCtOt0m0t.html">this</a> 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tE7ieWTn13oC.html">to</a> 
the 
princess.

"I 
think 
it 
would 
be 
best 
to 
appeal 
to 
that 
general," 
she 
continued,
"and 
I 
am 
sure 
that 
all 
due 
respect 
would 
be 
shown 
you."

Princess 
Mary 
read 
the 
paper, 
and 
her 
face 
began
