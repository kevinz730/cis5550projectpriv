that 
has 
fallen 
into 
it 
by 
chance
and 
is 
interfering 
with 
its 
action 
and 
tossing 
about 
in 
it 
is 
its 
most
important 
part. 
The 
man 
who 
does 
not 
understand 
the 
construction 
of
the 
machine 
cannot 
conceive 
that 
the 
small 
connecting 
cogwheel 
which
revolves 
quietly 
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
essential 
parts 
of 
the 
machine, 
and
not 
the 
shaving 
which 
merely 
harms 
and 
hinders 
the 
working.

On 
the 
tenth 
of 
October 
when 
Dokhturov 
had 
gone 
halfway 
to 
Forminsk 
and
stopped 
at 
the 
village 
of 
Aristovo, 
preparing 
faithfully 
to 
execute 
the
orders 
he 
had 
received, 
the 
whole 
French 
army 
having,<p>
in 
its<p>
convulsive
movement, 
reached 
Murat's 
position 
apparently 
in 
order 
to 
give
battle-suddenly 
without 
any 
reason 
turned 
off 
to 
the 
left 
onto 
the 
new
Kaluga 
road 
and 
began 
to 
enter 
Forminsk, 
where 
only 
Broussier 
had
been 
till 
then. 
At 
that 
time 
Dokhturov 
had 
under 
his 
command, 
besides
Dorokhov's 
detachment, 
the 
two 
small 
guerrilla 
detachments 
of 
Figner 
and
Seslavin.

On 
the 
evening 
of 
October 
11 
Seslavin 
came 
to 
the 
Aristovo 
headquarters
with 
a 
French 
guardsman 
he 
had 
captured. 
The 
prisoner 
said 
that 
the
troops 
that 
had 
entered 
Forminsk 
that 
day 
were 
the 
vanguard 
of 
the 
whole
army, 
that 
Napoleon 
was 
there 
and 
the 
whole 
army 
had 
left 
Moscow 
four
days 
previously. 
That 
same 
evening 
a 
house 
serf 
who 
had 
come 
from
Borovsk 
said 
he 
had 
seen 
an 
immense 
army 
entering 
the 
town. 
Some
Cossacks 
of 
Dokhturov's 
detachment 
reported 
having 
sighted 
the 
French
Guards 
marching 
along 
the 
road 
to 
Borovsk. 
From 
all 
these 
reports 
it 
was
evident 
that 
where 
they 
had 
expected 
to 
meet 
a 
single 
division 
there
was 
now 
the 
whole 
French 
army 
marching 
from 
Moscow 
in 
an 
unexpected
direction-along 
the 
Kaluga 
road. 
Dokhturov 
was 
unwilling 
to 
undertake
any 
action, 
as 
it 
was 
not 
clear 
to 
him 
now 
what 
he 
ought 
to 
do. 
He 
had
been 
ordered 
to 
attack 
Forminsk. 
But 
only 
Broussier 
had 
been 
<a href="/cZl/HG89CBzhL.html">there</a> 
at
that 
time 
and 
now 
the 
whole 
French 
army<p>
was 
there. 
Ermolov 
wished 
to 
act
on 
his 
own 
judgment, 
but 
<a href="/cZl/nHL70tvJE6nrOP.html">Dokhturov</a> 
insisted 
that 
he 
must 
have 
Kutuzov's
instructions. 
So 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
send 
a 
dispatch 
to 
the 
staff.

For 
this 
purpose 
a 
capable 
officer, 
Bolkhovitinov, 
was 
chosen, 
who
was 
to 
explain 
the 
whole 
affair 
by 
word 
of 
mouth, 
besides 
delivering
a 
written 
report. 
Toward 
midnight 
Bolkhovitinov, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ak7z7iY0e.html">having</a> 
received 
the
dispatch 
and 
verbal 
instructions, 
galloped 
off 
to 
the 
General 
Staff
accompanied 
by 
a 
Cossack 
with 
spare 
horses.





CHAPTER 
XVI

It 
was<p>
a 
warm, 
dark, 
autumn 
night. 
It 
had 
been 
raining 
for 
four 
days.
Having 
changed 
horses 
twice 
and 
galloped<p>
twenty 
miles 
in 
an 
hour 
and 
a
half 
over 
a 
sticky, 
muddy 
road, 
Bolkhovitinov 
reached 
Litashevka 
after
one 
o'clock 
at 
night. 
Dismounting 
at 
a 
cottage 
on 
whose 
wattle 
fence
hung 
a 
signboard, 
GENERAL 
STAFF, 
and 
throwing 
down 
his 
reins, 
he 
entered
a 
dark 
passage.

"The 
general 
on 
duty, 
quick! 
It's 
very 
important!" 
said 
he 
to 
someone
who 
had 
risen 
and 
was 
sniffing 
in 
the 
dark 
passage.

"He 
has 
been 
very 
unwell 
since 
the 
evening 
and 
this 
is 
the 
third 
night
he 
has 
not 
slept," 
said 
the 
orderly 
pleadingly 
in 
a 
whisper. 
"You
