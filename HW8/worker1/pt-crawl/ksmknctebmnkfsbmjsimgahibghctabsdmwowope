himself, 
a 
self-satisfied 
irrepressible 
smile 
puckering 
his 
lips 
under
his 
mustache. 
"Will 
you 
now 
be 
so 
good 
as 
to 
tell 
me 
with 
whom 
I 
have
the 
honor 
of 
conversing 
so 
pleasantly, 
instead 
of 
being 
in 
the 
ambulance
with 
that 
maniac's 
bullet 
in 
my 
body?"

Pierre<p>
replied 
that 
he 
could 
not 
tell 
him 
his 
name 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/dK2oGGl5ODiFp7xt.html">and,</a> 
blushing,
began 
to 
try 
to 
invent 
a 
name 
and 
to 
say 
something 
about 
his 
reason 
for
concealing 
it, 
but 
the 
Frenchman 
hastily 
interrupted 
him.

"Oh, 
please!" 
said 
he. 
"I 
understand 
your 
reasons. 
You 
are 
an 
officer...
a 
superior 
officer 
perhaps. 
You 
have 
borne 
arms 
against 
us. 
That's 
not
my 
business. 
I 
owe 
you 
my 
life. 
That 
is 
enough 
for 
me. 
I 
am 
quite 
at
your 
service. 
You 
belong 
to 
the 
gentry?" 
he 
concluded 
with 
a 
shade 
of
inquiry 
in 
his<p>
tone. 
Pierre 
bent 
his 
head. 
"Your 
baptismal 
name, 
if 
you
please. 
That 
is 
all 
I 
ask. 
Monsieur 
Pierre, 
you 
say.... 
That's 
all 
I
want 
to 
know."

When<p>
the 
mutton 
and 
an 
omelet 
had 
been 
served 
and 
a 
samovar 
and 
vodka
brought, 
with 
some 
wine 
which 
the 
French 
had 
taken 
from 
a 
Russian 
cellar
and 
brought 
with 
them, 
Ramballe 
invited 
Pierre 
to 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cg8tTZW1wUl0s.html">share</a> 
his 
dinner, 
and
himself 
began 
to 
eat 
greedily 
and 
quickly 
like 
a 
healthy 
and 
hungry 
man,
munching 
his 
food 
rapidly 
with 
his 
strong 
teeth, 
continually 
smacking
his 
lips, 
and 
repeating-"Excellent! 
Delicious!" 
His 
face 
grew 
red 
and
was 
covered 
with 
perspiration. 
Pierre 
was 
hungry 
and 
shared 
the 
dinner
with 
pleasure. 
Morel, 
the 
orderly, 
brought 
some 
hot 
water 
in 
a 
saucepan
and 
placed 
a 
bottle 
of 
claret 
in 
it. 
He 
also 
brought 
a 
bottle 
of 
kvass,
taken 
from 
the 
kitchen 
for 
them 
to 
try. 
That 
beverage 
was 
already 
known
to 
the 
French 
and 
had 
been 
given 
a 
special 
name. 
They 
called 
it 
limonade
de 
cochon 
(pig's 
lemonade), 
and 
Morel 
spoke 
well 
of 
the 
limonade 
de
cochon 
he 
had 
found 
in 
the 
kitchen. 
But 
as 
the 
captain 
had 
the 
wine 
they
had 
taken 
while 
passing 
through 
Moscow, 
he 
left 
the 
kvass 
to 
Morel 
and
applied 
himself 
to 
the 
bottle 
of 
Bordeaux. 
He 
wrapped 
the 
bottle 
up
to 
its 
neck 
in 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ee55vuxZ5.html">table</a> 
napkin 
and 
poured 
out 
wine
