and, 
hearing 
him
groan, 
said 
to 
herself 
with 
a 
sigh 
that 
things 
were 
still 
the 
same.

"But 
what 
could 
have 
happened? 
What<p>
did 
I 
want? 
I 
want 
his 
death!" 
she
cried 
with 
a 
feeling 
of 
loathing 
for 
herself.

She 
washed, 
dressed, 
said 
her 
prayers, 
and 
went 
out 
to 
the 
porch. 
In
front 
of 
it 
stood 
carriages 
without 
horses 
and 
things 
were 
being 
packed
into 
the 
vehicles.

It 
was 
a 
warm, 
gray 
morning. 
Princess 
Mary 
stopped 
at 
the 
porch, 
still
horrified 
by 
her 
spiritual 
baseness 
and 
trying 
to 
arrange 
her 
thoughts
before 
going 
to 
her 
father. 
The 
doctor 
came 
downstairs 
and 
went 
out 
to
her.

"He 
is 
a 
little 
better 
today," 
said 
he. 
"I 
was 
looking 
for 
you. 
One 
can
make 
out 
something 
of 
what 
he 
is 
saying. 
His 
head 
is 
clearer. 
Come 
in,
he 
is 
asking 
for 
you...."

Princess 
Mary's 
heart 
beat 
so 
violently 
at 
this 
news 
that 
she 
grew 
pale
and 
leaned 
against 
the 
wall 
to 
keep 
from 
falling. 
To 
see 
him, 
talk 
to
him, 
feel 
his 
<a href="/aVzUge/Dt5rq4kplH7ioN.html">eyes</a> 
on<p>
her 
now 
that 
her 
whole 
soul 
was<p>
overflowing 
with
those 
dreadful, 
wicked 
temptations, 
was 
a 
torment 
of 
joy 
and 
terror.

"Come," 
said 
the 
doctor.

Princess 
Mary 
entered 
her 
father's 
room 
and 
went 
up 
to 
his 
bed. 
He 
was
lying 
on 
his 
back 
propped 
up 
high, 
and 
his 
small 
bony 
hands 
with
their 
knotted 
purple 
veins 
were 
lying 
on 
the 
quilt; 
his 
left 
eye 
gazed
straight 
before 
him, 
his 
right 
eye 
was 
awry, 
and 
his 
brows 
and 
lips
motionless. 
He 
seemed 
altogether 
so 
thin, 
small, 
and 
pathetic. 
His 
face
seemed 
to 
have 
shriveled 
or 
melted; 
his 
features 
had 
grown 
smaller.
Princess 
Mary 
went 
up 
and 
kissed 
his 
hand. 
His 
left 
hand 
pressed 
hers
so 
that 
she 
understood 
that 
he 
had 
long 
been 
waiting 
for 
her 
to 
come. 
He
twitched 
her 
hand, 
and 
his 
brows 
and 
lips 
quivered 
angrily.

She 
looked 
at 
him 
in 
dismay 
trying 
to 
guess 
what<p>
he 
wanted 
of 
her. 
When
she 
changed 
her 
position 
so 
that 
his 
left 
eye 
could 
see 
her 
face 
he
calmed 
down, 
not 
taking 
his 
eyes 
off 
her 
for 
some 
seconds. 
Then 
<a href="/aVzUge/ugX4It21Fv.html">his</a> 
lips
and 
tongue 
moved, 
sounds 
came, 
and 
he 
began 
to 
speak, 
gazing 
timidly 
and
imploringly 
at 
her, 
evidently 
afraid 
that 
she 
might 
not 
understand.

Straining 
all 
her 
faculties 
Princess 
Mary 
looked 
at 
him. 
The 
comic
efforts 
with 
which 
he 
moved 
his 
tongue 
made 
her 
drop 
her 
eyes 
and 
with
difficulty 
repress 
the 
sobs 
that 
rose 
to 
her 
throat. 
He 
said 
something,
repeating 
the 
same 
words 
several 
times. 
She 
could 
not 
understand 
them,
but 
tried 
to 
guess 
what 
he 
was 
saying 
and 
inquiringly 
repeated 
the 
words
he 
uttered.

"Mmm...ar...ate...ate..." 
he 
repeated 
several 
times.

It 
was 
quite 
impossible 
to 
understand 
these 
sounds. 
The 
doctor 
thought
he 
had 
guessed 
them, 
and 
inquiringly 
repeated: 
"Mary, 
are 
you 
afraid?"
The 
prince 
shook 
his 
head, 
again 
repeated 
the 
same 
sounds.

"My 
mind, 
my 
mind 
aches?" 
questioned 
Princess 
Mary.

He 
made 
a 
mumbling 
sound 
in 
confirmation 
of 
this, 
took 
her 
hand, 
and
began 
pressing 
it 
to 
different 
parts 
of 
his 
breast 
as 
if 
trying 
to 
find
the 
right 
place 
for 
it.

"Always 
thoughts... 
about 
you... 
thoughts..." 
he 
then 
uttered 
much
more 
clearly 
than 
he 
had 
done 
before, 
now 
that 
he 
was 
sure 
of 
being
understood.

Princess 
Mary 
pressed 
her 
head 
against 
his 
hand, 
trying<p>
to 
hide 
her 
sobs
and 
tears.

He 
moved 
his 
hand 
over 
her 
hair.

"I 
have 
been 
calling 
you 
all 
night..." 
he 
brought
