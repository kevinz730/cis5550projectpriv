Sonya

white.

Natasha, 
seeing 
the 
impression 
the 
news 
of 
her 
brother's 
wound
produced 
on 
Sonya, 
felt 
for 
the 
first 
time 
the 
sorrowful 
side 
of 
the
news.

She 
rushed 
to 
Sonya, 
hugged 
her, 
and 
began 
to 
cry.

"A 
little 
wound, 
but 
he 
has 
been 
made 
an 
officer; 
he 
is 
well 
now, 
he
wrote 
himself," 
said 
she 
through 
her 
tears.

"There 
now! 
It's 
true 
that 
all 
you 
women 
are 
crybabies," 
remarked
Petya, 
pacing 
the 
room 
with 
large, 
resolute 
strides. 
"Now 
I'm 
very
glad, 
very 
glad 
indeed, 
that 
my 
brother 
has 
distinguished 
himself 
so.
You 
are 
all 
blubberers<p>
and 
understand 
nothing."

Natasha 
smiled 
through 
her 
tears.

"You 
haven't 
read 
the 
letter?" 
asked 
Sonya.

"No, 
but 
she 
<a href="/aVzUge/gJL2AgW2UGRY0uIRD.html">said</a> 
that 
it 
was 
all 
over 
and 
that 
he's 
now 
an
officer."

"Thank 
God!" 
said 
Sonya, 
crossing 
herself. 
"But 
perhaps 
she
deceived 
you. 
Let 
us 
go 
to 
Mamma."

Petya 
paced 
the 
room 
in 
silence 
for 
a 
time.

"If 
I'd 
been 
in 
Nikolenka's 
place 
I 
would 
have 
killed 
even 
more
of 
those 
Frenchmen," 
he 
said. 
"What 
nasty 
brutes 
they 
are! 
I'd
have 
killed<p>
so 
many 
that 
there'd 
have 
been 
a 
heap 
of 
them."

"Hold 
your 
tongue, 
Petya, 
what 
a 
goose 
you 
are!"

"I'm 
not 
a 
goose, 
but 
they 
are 
who 
cry 
about 
trifles," 
said
Petya.

"Do 
you 
remember 
him?" 
Natasha 
suddenly 
asked, 
after 
a 
moment's
silence.

Sonya 
smiled.

"Do 
I 
remember 
Nicholas?"

"No, 
Sonya, 
but 
do 
you 
remember 
so 
that 
you 
remember 
him 
perfectly,
remember 
everything?" 
said 
Natasha, 
with 
an 
expressive 
gesture,
evidently 
wishing 
to 
give 
her 
words 
a 
very 
definite 
meaning. 
"I
remember 
Nikolenka 
too, 
I 
remember 
him 
well," 
she 
said. 
"But 
I
don't 
remember 
Boris. 
I 
don't 
remember 
him 
a 
bit."

"What! 
You 
don't 
remember 
Boris?" 
asked 
Sonya 
in 
surprise.

"It's 
not 
that 
I 
don't 
remember-I 
know 
what 
he 
is 
like, 
but 
not
as 
I 
remember 
Nikolenka. 
Him-I 
just 
shut 
my 
eyes 
and 
remember,
but 
Boris... 
No!" 
(She 
shut 
her 
eyes.) 
"No! 
there's 
nothing 
at
all."

"Oh, 
Natasha!" 
said 
Sonya, 
looking 
ecstatically 
and 
earnestly 
at
her 
friend 
as 
if 
she 
did 
not 
consider 
her 
worthy 
to 
hear 
what 
she 
meant
to 
say 
and 
as 
if 
she 
were 
saying 
it 
to 
someone 
else, 
with 
whom 
joking
was 
out 
of 
the 
question, 
"I 
am 
in 
love 
with 
your 
brother 
once 
for 
all
and, 
whatever 
may 
happen 
to 
him 
or 
to 
me, 
shall 
never<p>
cease 
to 
love 
him
as 
long 
as 
I 
live."

Natasha 
looked 
at 
Sonya 
with 
wondering 
and 
inquisitive 
eyes, 
and 
said
nothing. 
She 
felt 
that 
Sonya 
was
