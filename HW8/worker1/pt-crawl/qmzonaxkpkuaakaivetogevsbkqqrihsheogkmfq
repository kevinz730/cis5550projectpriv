make 
out 
what</h1>he
wanted. 
He 
was 
lifted 
up, 
carried 
to 
his 
study, 
and 
laid 
on 
the 
very
couch 
he 
had 
so 
feared 
of 
late.

The 
doctor, 
who 
was 
fetched 
that 
same 
night, 
bled 
him 
and 
said 
that 
the
prince 
had 
had 
a<p>
seizure 
paralyzing 
his 
right 
side.

It 
was 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
dangerous 
to 
remain 
at 
Bald 
Hills, 
and
next 
day 
they 
moved 
the 
prince 
to 
Bogucharovo, 
the 
doctor 
accompanying
him.

By 
the 
time 
they 
reached 
Bogucharovo, 
Dessalles 
and 
the 
little 
prince
had 
already 
left 
for 
Moscow.

For 
three 
weeks 
the 
old 
prince 
lay 
stricken 
by 
paralysis 
in 
the 
new
house 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
built 
at 
Bogucharovo, 
ever 
in 
the 
same 
state,
getting 
neither 
better 
nor 
worse. 
He 
was 
unconscious 
and 
lay 
like
a 
distorted 
corpse. 
He 
muttered 
unceasingly, 
his 
eyebrows 
and 
lips
twitching, 
and 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
tell 
whether 
he 
understood 
what 
was
going 
on 
around 
him 
or 
not. 
One 
thing 
was 
certain-that 
he 
was 
suffering
and 
wished 
to 
say 
something. 
But 
what 
it 
was, 
no 
one 
could 
tell: 
it
might 
be 
some 
caprice 
of 
a 
sick 
and 
half-crazy 
man, 
or 
it 
might 
relate
to 
public 
affairs, 
or 
possibly 
to 
family 
concerns.

The 
doctor 
said 
this 
restlessness 
did 
not 
mean 
anything 
and 
was 
due
to 
physical 
causes; 
but 
Princess 
Mary 
thought 
he 
wished 
to 
tell
her 
something, 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
her 
presence 
always 
increased 
his
restlessness 
confirmed 
her 
opinion.

He 
was 
evidently 
suffering 
both 
physically 
and 
mentally. 
There 
was 
no
hope 
of 
recovery. 
It 
was 
impossible 
for 
him 
to 
travel, 
it 
would 
not 
do
to 
let 
him 
die 
on 
the 
road. 
"Would 
it 
not 
be 
better 
if 
the 
end 
did 
come,
the 
very 
end?" 
Princess 
Mary 
sometimes 
thought. 
Night 
and 
day, 
hardly
sleeping 
at 
all, 
she 
watched 
him 
and, 
terrible 
to 
say, 
often 
watched
him 
not 
with 
hope 
of 
finding 
signs 
of 
improvement 
but 
wishing 
to 
find
symptoms 
of 
the 
approach 
of 
the 
end.

Strange 
as 
it 
was 
to 
her 
to 
acknowledge 
this 
feeling 
in 
herself, 
yet
there 
it 
was. 
And 
what 
seemed 
still 
more 
terrible 
to 
her 
was 
that 
since
her 
father's 
illness 
began 
(perhaps 
even 
sooner, 
when 
she 
stayed 
with
him 
expecting 
something 
to 
happen), 
all 
the 
personal 
desires 
and 
hopes
that 
had 
been 
forgotten 
or 
sleeping 
within 
her 
had 
awakened. 
Thoughts
that 
had 
not 
entered 
her 
mind 
for 
years-thoughts 
of 
a 
life 
free 
from
the 
fear 
of 
her 
father, 
and 
even 
the 
possibility 
of 
love 
and 
of 
family
happiness-floated 
continually 
in 
her 
imagination 
like 
temptations 
of 
the
devil. 
Thrust 
them 
aside 
as 
she 
would, 
questions 
continually 
recurred
to 
her 
as 
to 
how 
she 
would 
order 
her 
life 
now, 
after 
that. 
These 
were
temptations 
of 
the 
devil 
and 
Princess 
Mary 
knew 
it. 
She 
knew 
that 
the
sole 
weapon 
against 
him 
was 
prayer, 
and 
she 
tried 
to 
pray. 
She 
assumed
an 
attitude 
of 
prayer, 
looked 
at 
the 
icons, 
repeated 
the 
words 
of 
a
prayer, 
but 
she 
could 
not 
pray. 
She 
felt 
that 
a 
different 
world 
had
now 
taken 
possession 
of 
her-the 
life 
of 
a 
world 
of 
strenuous 
and 
free
activity, 
quite 
opposed 
to 
the 
spiritual 
world 
in 
which 
till 
now 
she
had 
been 
confined 
and 
in 
which 
her 
greatest 
comfort 
had 
been 
prayer.
She 
could 
not 
pray, 
could 
not 
weep, 
and 
worldly 
cares 
took 
possession 
of
her.

It 
was 
becoming 
dangerous 
to 
remain 
in 
Bogucharovo. 
News 
of 
the 
approach
of 
the 
French 
came 
from 
all 
sides, 
and 
in 
one 
village, 
ten 
miles 
from
Bogucharovo, 
a 
homestead 
had 
been 
looted 
by 
French 
marauders.

The 
doctor 
insisted 
on 
the 
necessity 
of 
moving 
the 
prince; 
the
provincial 
Marshal 
of 
the 
Nobility 
sent 
an 
official 
to 
Princess 
Mary
to 
persuade 
her 
to 
get 
away 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible, 
and 
the 
head 
of 
the
rural 
police 
having 
come 
to 
Bogucharovo 
urged 
the 
same 
thing, 
saying
that 
the 
French 
were 
only 
some 
twenty-five 
miles 
away, 
that 
French
proclamations 
were 
circulating 
in 
the 
villages, 
and 
that 
if 
the 
princess
did 
not 
take 
her 
father 
away 
before 
the 
fifteenth, 
he 
could 
not 
answer
for 
the 
consequences.

The 
princess 
decided 
to 
leave 
on 
the 
fifteenth. 
The 
cares 
of 
preparation
and 
giving 
orders, 
for 
which 
everyone 
came
