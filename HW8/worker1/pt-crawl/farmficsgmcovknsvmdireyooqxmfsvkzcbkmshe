and 
now 
and 
then 
women.

Pierre 
did 
not 
see 
the 
people 
as 
individuals 
but 
saw 
their 
movement.

All 
these 
people 
and 
horses 
seemed 
driven 
forward 
by 
some 
invisible
power. 
During 
the 
hour 
Pierre 
watched 
them 
they 
all 
came 
flowing 
from
the 
different 
streets 
with 
one 
and 
the 
same 
desire 
to 
get 
on 
quickly;
they 
all 
jostled 
one 
another, 
began 
to 
grow 
angry 
and 
to 
fight, 
white
teeth 
gleamed, 
brows 
frowned, 
ever 
the 
same 
words 
of 
abuse 
flew 
from
side 
to 
side, 
and 
all 
the 
faces 
bore 
the 
same 
swaggeringly 
resolute
and 
coldly 
cruel 
expression 
that 
had 
struck 
Pierre 
that 
morning 
on 
the
corporal's 
face 
when 
the 
drums 
were 
beating.

It 
was 
not 
till 
nearly 
evening 
that 
the 
officer 
commanding 
the 
escort
collected 
his 
men 
and 
with 
shouts 
and<p>
quarrels 
forced 
his 
way 
in 
among
the 
baggage 
trains, 
and 
the 
prisoners, 
hemmed 
in 
on 
all<p>
sides, 
emerged
onto 
the 
Kaluga 
road.

They 
marched 
very 
quickly, 
without 
resting, 
and 
halted 
only 
when 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/hp8Ro6H8Fmd.html">sun
began</a> 
to 
set. 
The 
baggage 
carts 
drew 
up 
close 
together 
and 
the 
men
began 
to 
prepare 
for 
their 
night's 
rest. 
They 
all 
appeared 
angry 
and
dissatisfied. 
For 
a 
long 
time, 
oaths, 
angry 
shouts, 
and 
fighting 
could
be 
heard 
from 
all 
sides. 
A 
carriage 
that 
followed 
the 
escort 
ran
into 
one 
of 
the 
carts 
and 
knocked 
a 
hole 
in 
it 
with 
its 
pole. 
Several
soldiers 
ran 
toward 
the 
cart 
from 
different 
sides: 
some 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vh5UTE21.html">beat</a> 
the
carriage 
horses 
on 
their 
heads, 
turning 
them 
aside, 
others<p>
fought 
among
themselves, 
and 
Pierre 
saw 
that 
one 
German 
was 
badly 
wounded 
on 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Nu5fnBp1NX3.html">the</a> 
head
by 
a 
sword.

It 
seemed 
that 
all 
these 
men, 
now 
that 
they 
had 
stopped 
amid 
fields
in 
the 
chill 
dusk 
of 
the 
autumn 
evening, 
experienced 
one 
and 
the 
same
feeling 
of 
unpleasant 
awakening 
from 
the 
hurry 
and 
eagerness 
to 
push 
on
that 
had 
seized 
them 
at 
the 
start. 
Once 
at 
a 
standstill 
they 
all 
seemed
to 
understand 
that 
they 
did 
not 
yet 
know 
where 
they 
were 
going, 
and 
that
much 
that 
was 
painful 
and 
difficult 
awaited 
them 
on 
this 
journey.

During 
this 
halt 
the 
escort 
treated 
the 
prisoners 
even 
worse 
than 
they
had 
done 
<a href="/cZl/yY6l5dZEO8hMvng.html">at</a> 
the 
start. 
It 
was 
here 
that 
the 
prisoners 
for 
the 
first 
time
received 
horseflesh 
for 
their 
meat 
ration.

From 
the 
officer 
down 
to 
the 
lowest 
soldier 
they 
showed 
what 
seemed 
like
personal 
spite 
against 
each 
of 
the 
prisoners,
