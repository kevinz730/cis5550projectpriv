"A

CHAPTER 
V

While 
waiting 
for 
the 
announcement 
of 
his 
appointment 
to 
the 
committee
Prince 
Andrew 
looked 
up 
his 
former 
acquaintances, 
particularly 
those 
he
knew 
to 
be 
in 
power 
and 
whose 
aid 
he 
might 
need. 
In 
Petersburg 
he 
now
experienced 
the 
same 
feeling 
he 
had 
had 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
a 
battle, 
when
troubled 
<a href="/cZl/sV8C5fPTu.html">by</a> 
anxious 
curiosity 
and 
irresistibly 
attracted 
to 
the 
ruling
circles 
where 
the 
future, 
on 
which 
the 
fate 
of 
millions 
depended, 
was
being 
shaped. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ovD8iLv86kW.html">From</a> 
the 
irritation 
of 
the 
older 
men, 
the 
curiosity 
of 
the
uninitiated, 
the 
reserve 
of 
the 
initiated, 
the 
hurry 
and 
preoccupation
of 
everyone, 
and 
the 
innumerable 
committees 
and 
commissions 
of 
whose
existence 
he 
learned 
every 
day, 
he 
felt 
that 
now, 
in 
1809, 
here 
in
Petersburg 
a 
vast 
civil 
conflict 
was 
in 
preparation, 
the 
commander 
in
chief 
of 
which 
was 
a 
mysterious 
person 
he 
did 
not 
know, 
but 
who 
was
supposed 
<a href="/aVzUge/Nb5NPT0rP2WUDW.html">to</a> 
be 
a 
man 
of 
genius-Speranski. 
And 
this 
movement 
of
reconstruction 
of 
which 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
a 
vague 
idea, 
and 
Speranski
its 
chief 
promoter, 
began 
to 
interest 
him 
so 
keenly 
that 
the 
question
of 
the 
army 
regulations 
quickly 
receded 
to 
a 
secondary 
place 
in<p>
his
consciousness.

Prince 
Andrew 
was 
most 
favorably 
placed 
to 
secure 
good 
reception 
in 
the
highest 
and 
most 
diverse 
Petersburg 
circles 
of 
the 
day. 
The 
reforming
party 
cordially 
welcomed 
and<p>
courted 
him, 
in 
the 
first 
place 
because
he 
was 
reputed 
to 
be 
clever 
and 
very 
well 
read, 
and 
secondly 
because 
by
liberating 
his 
serfs 
he 
had 
obtained 
the 
reputation 
of 
being 
a 
liberal.
The 
party 
of 
the 
old 
and 
dissatisfied, 
who 
censured 
the 
innovations,
turned 
to 
him 
expecting 
his 
sympathy 
in 
their 
disapproval 
of 
the
reforms, 
simply 
because 
he 
was 
the 
son 
of 
his 
father. 
The 
feminine
society 
world 
welcomed 
him 
gladly, 
because 
he 
was 
rich, 
distinguished, 
a
good 
match, 
and 
almost 
a 
newcomer, 
with 
a 
halo 
of 
romance 
on 
account
of 
his 
supposed 
death 
and 
the 
tragic 
loss 
of 
his 
wife. 
Besides 
this
the 
general 
opinion 
of 
all 
who 
had 
known 
him 
previously 
was 
that 
he 
had
greatly 
improved 
during<p>
these 
last 
five 
years, 
having 
softened 
and 
grown
more 
manly, 
lost 
his 
former 
affectation, 
pride, 
and 
contemptuous 
irony,
and 
acquired 
the 
serenity 
that 
comes 
with 
years. 
People 
talked 
about
him, 
were 
interested 
in 
him, 
and 
wanted 
to 
meet 
him.

The 
day 
after 
his 
interview 
with 
Count 
Arakcheev, 
Prince 
Andrew 
spent
the 
evening 
at 
Count 
Kochubey's. 
He 
told 
the 
count 
of 
his 
interview
with 
Sila 
Andreevich 
(Kochubey 
spoke<p>
of 
Arakcheev 
by 
that 
nickname
with 
the 
same 
vague 
irony 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
noticed 
in 
the 
Minister 
of
War's 
anteroom).

"Mon 
cher, 
even 
in 
this 
case 
you 
can't 
do 
without 
Michael
Mikhaylovich 
Speranski. 
He 
manages 
everything. 
I'll 
speak<p>
to 
him. 
He
has 
promised 
to 
come 
this 
evening."

"What 
has 
Speranski 
to 
do 
with 
the 
army 
regulations?" 
asked 
Prince
Andrew.

Kochubey 
shook 
his 
head 
smilingly, 
as 
if 
surprised 
at 
Bolkonski's
simplicity.

"We 
were 
talking 
to 
him<p>
about 
you 
a 
few 
days 
ago," 
Kochubey
continued, 
"and 
about 
your 
freed 
plowmen."

"Oh, 
is 
it 
you, 
Prince, 
who 
have 
freed 
your 
serfs?" 
said 
an 
old 
man
of 
Catherine's 
day, 
turning 
contemptuously 
toward 
Bolkonski.

"It 
was 
a 
small 
estate 
that 
brought 
in 
no 
profit," 
replied 
Prince
Andrew, 
trying 
to 
extenuate 
his 
action 
so 
as 
not 
to 
irritate 
the 
old 
man
uselessly.

"Afraid 
of 
being 
late..." 
said 
the 
old 
man, 
looking 
at 
Kochubey.

"There's 
one 
thing 
I 
don't 
understand," 
he 
continued. 
"Who
will 
plow 
the 
land 
if 
they 
are 
set 
free? 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
write 
laws,
