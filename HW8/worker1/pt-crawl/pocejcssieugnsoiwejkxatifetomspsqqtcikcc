"But 
how 
are 
you 
to 
get 
that 
balance?" 
Pierre 
was 
beginning.

At 
that 
moment 
Anna<p>
Pavlovna 
came 
up<p>
and, 
looking 
severely 
at 
Pierre,
asked 
the 
Italian 
how 
he 
stood 
Russian 
climate. 
The 
Italian's
face 
instantly 
changed 
and 
assumed<p>
an 
offensively 
affected, 
sugary
expression, 
evidently 
habitual 
to 
him 
when 
conversing 
with 
women.

"I 
am 
so 
enchanted 
by 
the 
brilliancy 
of 
the 
wit 
and 
culture 
of 
the
society, 
more<p>
especially 
of 
the 
feminine 
society, 
in 
which 
I 
have 
had
the 
honor 
of 
being 
received, 
that 
I 
have 
not 
yet 
had 
time 
to 
think 
of
the 
climate," 
said 
he.

Not 
letting 
the 
abbe 
and 
Pierre 
escape, 
Anna 
Pavlovna, 
the 
more
conveniently 
to 
keep 
them 
under 
observation, 
brought 
them 
into 
the
larger<p>
circle.





CHAPTER 
IV

Just 
then 
another 
visitor 
entered 
the 
drawing 
room: 
Prince 
Andrew
Bolkonski, 
the 
little 
princess' 
husband. 
He 
was 
a 
very 
handsome 
young
man, 
of 
medium 
height, 
with 
firm, 
clearcut 
features. 
Everything 
about
him, 
from 
his 
weary, 
bored 
expression 
to 
his 
quiet, 
measured 
step,
offered 
a 
most 
striking 
contrast 
to 
his 
quiet, 
little 
wife. 
It 
was
evident 
that 
he 
not 
only 
knew 
everyone 
in 
the 
drawing 
room, 
but 
had
found 
them 
to 
be 
so 
tiresome 
that 
it 
wearied 
him 
to 
look 
<a href="/cZl/jM2GLq7AjGP7ws.html">at</a> 
or 
listen 
to
them. 
And 
among 
all 
these 
faces 
that 
he 
found 
so 
tedious, 
none 
seemed
to 
bore 
him 
so 
much 
as 
that 
of 
his 
pretty 
wife. 
He 
turned 
away 
from
her 
with 
a 
grimace 
that<p>
distorted 
his 
handsome 
face, 
kissed 
Anna
Pavlovna's 
hand, 
and 
screwing 
up 
his 
eyes 
scanned 
the 
whole 
company.

"You 
are 
off 
to 
the 
war, 
Prince?" 
said 
Anna 
Pavlovna.

"General 
Kutuzov," 
said 
Bolkonski, 
speaking 
French 
and 
stressing
the 
last 
syllable 
of 
the 
general's 
name 
like 
a 
Frenchman, 
"has 
been
pleased 
to 
take 
me 
<a href="/cZl/Nz6YyaBP3SEu2IoNM.html">as</a> 
an 
aide-de-camp...."

"And 
Lise, 
your 
wife?"

"She 
will 
go 
to 
the 
country."

"Are 
you 
not 
ashamed 
to 
deprive 
us 
of 
your 
charming 
wife?"

"Andre," 
said 
his 
wife, 
addressing 
her 
husband 
in 
the 
same
coquettish 
manner 
in 
which 
she 
spoke 
to 
other 
men, 
"the 
vicomte 
has
been 
telling 
us 
such 
a 
tale 
about 
Mademoiselle 
George 
and 
Buonaparte!"

Prince 
Andrew 
screwed 
up 
his 
eyes 
and 
turned 
away. 
Pierre, 
who 
from
the 
moment 
Prince 
Andrew 
entered 
the 
room 
had 
watched 
him 
with 
glad,
affectionate 
eyes, 
now 
came 
up 
and 
took 
his 
arm. 
Before 
he 
looked 
round
Prince 
Andrew 
frowned 
again, 
expressing 
his 
annoyance 
with 
whoever 
was
touching 
his 
arm, 
but 
when 
he 
saw 
Pierre's 
beaming 
face 
he 
gave 
him 
an
unexpectedly 
kind 
and 
pleasant 
smile.

"There 
now!... 
So 
you, 
too, 
are 
in 
the 
great 
world?" 
said 
he 
to
Pierre.

"I 
knew 
you 
would 
be 
here," 
replied 
Pierre. 
"I 
will 
come 
to 
supper
with 
you. 
May 
I?" 
he 
added 
in 
a 
low 
voice 
so 
as 
not 
to 
disturb 
the
vicomte 
who 
was 
continuing 
his 
story.

"No, 
impossible!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
laughing 
and 
pressing
Pierre's 
hand 
to 
show 
that 
there 
was 
no 
need 
to 
ask 
the 
question. 
He
wished 
to 
say
