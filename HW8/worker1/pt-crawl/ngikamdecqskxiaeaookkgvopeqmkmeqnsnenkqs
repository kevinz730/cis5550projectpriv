I 
disgraced</h1>myself 
in 
any 
way? 
No,
that's 
not 
it." 
Something 
else, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UZ5O5Yg6kplH.html">resembling</a> 
remorse, 
tormented 
him. 
"Yes,
oh 
yes, 
that 
French 
officer 
with 
the 
dimple. 
And 
I 
remember 
how 
my 
arm
paused 
when 
I 
raised 
it."

Rostov 
saw 
the 
prisoners 
being 
led 
away 
and 
galloped 
after 
them 
to 
have
a 
look 
at 
his 
Frenchman 
with 
the 
dimple 
on 
his 
chin. 
He 
was 
sitting 
in
his 
foreign 
uniform 
on 
an 
hussar 
packhorse 
and 
looked 
anxiously 
about
him. 
The 
sword 
cut 
on 
his 
arm 
could 
scarcely 
be 
called 
a 
wound. 
He
glanced 
at 
Rostov 
with 
a 
feigned 
smile 
and 
waved 
his 
hand 
in 
greeting.
Rostov 
still 
had 
the 
same 
indefinite 
feeling, 
as 
of 
shame.

All 
that 
day 
and 
the 
next 
his 
friends 
and 
comrades 
noticed 
that 
Rostov,
without 
being 
dull 
or 
angry, 
was 
silent, 
thoughtful, 
and 
preoccupied.
He 
drank 
reluctantly, 
tried 
to 
remain 
alone, 
and 
kept 
turning 
something
over 
in 
his 
mind.

Rostov 
was 
always 
thinking 
about 
that 
brilliant 
exploit 
of 
his, 
which 
to
his 
amazement 
had 
gained 
him 
the 
St. 
George's 
Cross 
and 
even 
given 
him
a 
reputation 
for 
bravery, 
and 
there 
was 
something 
he 
could 
not<p>
at 
all
understand. 
"So 
others 
are 
even 
more 
afraid 
than 
I 
am!" 
he 
thought. 
"So
that's 
all 
there 
is 
in 
what 
is 
called 
heroism! 
And 
did 
I 
do 
it 
for 
my
country's 
sake? 
And 
how 
was 
he 
to 
blame, 
with 
his 
dimple 
and 
blue 
eyes?
And 
how 
frightened 
he 
was! 
He 
thought 
that 
I 
should 
kill 
him. 
Why 
should
I 
kill 
him? 
My 
hand 
trembled. 
And 
they 
have 
given 
me 
a 
St. 
George's
Cross.... 
I 
can't 
make 
it 
out 
at 
all."

But 
while 
Nicholas 
was 
considering 
these 
questions 
and 
still 
could 
reach
no 
clear 
solution 
of 
what 
puzzled 
him 
so, 
the 
wheel 
of 
fortune 
in 
the
service, 
as 
often 
happens, 
turned 
in 
his 
favor. 
After 
the 
affair 
at
Ostrovna 
he 
was 
brought 
into 
notice, 
received 
command 
of 
an 
hussar
battalion, 
and 
when 
a 
brave 
officer 
was 
needed 
he 
was 
chosen.
