The 
Sparrow 
Hills 
were 
visible 
in 
the 
distance,
with 
the 
village, 
the 
church, 
and 
the 
large 
white 
house. 
The 
bare 
trees,
the 
sand, 
the 
bricks 
and 
roofs 
of 
the 
houses, 
the 
green 
church 
spire,
and 
the 
corners 
of 
the 
white 
house 
in 
the 
distance, 
all 
stood 
out 
in 
the
transparent 
air 
in 
most 
delicate 
outline 
and 
with 
unnatural 
clearness.
Near 
by 
could 
be 
seen 
the 
familiar 
ruins 
of 
a 
half-burned 
mansion
occupied 
by 
the 
French, 
with 
lilac 
bushes 
still 
showing 
dark 
green
beside 
the 
fence. 
And 
even 
that 
ruined 
and 
befouled 
house-which 
in 
dull
weather 
was 
repulsively 
ugly-seemed 
quietly 
beautiful 
now, 
in 
the 
clear,
motionless 
brilliance.

A 
French 
corporal, 
with 
coat 
unbuttoned 
in 
a 
homely 
way,<p>
a 
skullcap 
on
his 
head, 
and 
a 
short 
pipe 
in 
his 
mouth, 
came 
from 
behind 
a 
corner 
of
the 
shed 
and 
approached 
Pierre 
with 
a 
friendly 
wink.

"What 
sunshine, 
Monsieur 
Kiril!" 
(Their 
name 
for 
Pierre.) 
"Eh? 
Just 
like
spring!"

And 
the 
corporal 
leaned 
against 
the 
door 
and 
offered 
Pierre 
his 
pipe,
though 
whenever 
he 
offered 
it 
Pierre 
always 
declined 
it.

"To 
be 
on 
the 
march 
in 
such 
weather..." 
he 
began.

Pierre 
inquired 
what 
was 
being 
said 
about 
leaving, 
and 
the 
corporal 
told
him 
that 
nearly 
all 
the 
troops 
were 
starting 
and 
there 
ought 
to 
be 
an
order 
about 
the 
prisoners 
that 
day. 
Sokolov, 
one 
of 
the 
soldiers 
in 
the
shed 
with 
Pierre, 
was 
dying, 
and 
Pierre 
told 
the 
corporal 
that 
something
should 
be 
done 
about 
him. 
The 
corporal 
replied 
that 
Pierre 
need 
not
worry 
about 
that 
as 
they 
had 
an 
ambulance 
and 
a 
permanent 
hospital 
and
arrangements 
would 
be 
made 
for 
the 
sick, 
and 
that 
in 
general 
everything
that 
could 
happen 
had 
been 
foreseen 
by 
the 
authorities.

"Besides, 
Monsieur 
Kiril, 
you 
have 
only 
to 
say 
a 
word 
to 
the 
captain,
you 
know. 
He 
is 
a 
man 
who 
never 
forgets 
anything. 
Speak 
to 
the 
captain
when 
he 
makes 
his 
round, 
he 
will 
do 
anything 
for 
you."

(The 
captain 
of 
whom 
the 
corporal 
spoke 
often 
had 
long 
chats 
with 
Pierre
and 
showed 
him 
all 
sorts 
of 
favors.)

"'You 
see, 
St. 
Thomas,' 
he 
said 
to 
me 
the 
other 
day. 
'Monsieur 
Kiril 
is
a 
man 
of 
education, 
who 
speaks 
French. 
He 
is 
a 
Russian 
seigneur 
who 
has
had 
misfortunes, 
but 
he 
is 
a 
man. 
He 
knows 
what's 
what.... 
If 
he 
wants
anything 
and 
asks 
me, 
he 
won't 
get 
a 
refusal. 
When 
one 
has 
studied, 
you
see, 
one 
likes 
education 
and 
well-bred 
people.' 
It 
is 
for 
your 
sake 
I
mention 
it, 
Monsieur 
Kiril. 
The 
other 
day 
if 
it 
had 
not 
been 
for 
you
that 
affair 
would 
have 
ended 
ill."

And 
after 
chatting 
a 
while 
longer, 
the 
corporal 
went 
away. 
(The 
affair
he 
had 
alluded 
to 
had 
<a href="/cZl/Xo8fnBp1EPTad8Cr.html">happened</a> 
a 
few 
days 
before-a 
fight 
between 
the
prisoners 
and 
the 
French 
soldiers, 
in 
which 
Pierre 
had 
succeeded 
in
pacifying 
his 
comrades.) 
Some 
of 
the 
prisoners 
who 
had 
heard 
Pierre
talking 
to 
the 
corporal 
immediately 
asked 
what 
the 
Frenchman 
had 
said.
While 
Pierre 
was 
repeating 
what 
he 
had 
been 
told 
about 
the 
army 
leaving
Moscow, 
a 
thin, 
sallow, 
tattered 
French 
soldier 
came 
up 
to 
the 
door 
of
the 
shed. 
Rapidly 
and 
timidly 
raising 
his 
fingers 
to 
his 
forehead 
by
