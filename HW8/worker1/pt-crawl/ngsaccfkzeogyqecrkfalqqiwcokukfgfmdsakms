you?"

"Yes."

"And 
what's 
your 
name?"

"Peter</h1>Kirilych."

"Well 
then, 
Peter 
Kirilych, 
come 
along 
with 
us, 
we'll 
take 
you 
there."

In 
the 
total 
darkness 
the 
soldiers 
walked 
with 
Pierre 
to 
Mozhaysk.

By 
the 
time 
they 
got 
near 
Mozhaysk 
and 
began 
ascending 
the 
steep 
hill
into 
the 
town, 
the 
cocks 
were 
already 
crowing. 
Pierre 
went 
on 
with 
the
soldiers, 
quite 
forgetting 
<a href="/aVzUge/bmp3Url9qrwB.html">that</a> 
his 
inn 
was 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ze3mAz2gcFtr.html">the</a> 
hill
and 
that 
he 
had 
already 
passed 
it. 
He 
would 
not 
soon 
have 
remembered
this, 
such 
was 
his 
state 
of 
forgetfulness, 
had 
he 
not 
halfway 
up 
the
hill 
stumbled 
upon 
his 
groom, 
who 
had 
been 
to 
look 
for 
him 
in 
the
town 
and 
was 
returning 
to 
the 
inn. 
The 
groom 
recognized 
Pierre 
in 
the
darkness 
by 
his 
white 
hat.

"Your 
excellency!" 
he 
said. 
"Why, 
we 
were 
beginning 
<a href="/aVzUge/qQ69oFcgw4PUmnH.html">to</a> 
despair! 
How 
is
it 
you 
are 
on 
foot? 
And 
where 
are 
you 
going, 
please?"

"Oh, 
yes!" 
said 
Pierre.

The 
soldiers 
stopped.

"So 
you've 
found 
your 
folk?" 
said 
one 
of 
them. 
"Well, 
good-by, 
Peter
Kirilych-isn't 
it?"

"Good-by, 
Peter 
Kirilych!" 
Pierre 
heard 
the 
other 
voices 
repeat.

"Good-by!" 
he 
said 
and 
turned 
with 
his 
groom 
toward 
the<p>
inn.

"I 
ought 
to 
give 
them 
something!" 
he<p>
thought, 
and 
felt 
in 
his 
pocket.
"No, 
better 
not!" 
said 
another, 
inner 
voice.

There 
was 
not 
a 
room 
to 
be 
had 
at 
the 
inn, 
they 
were 
all 
occupied.
Pierre 
went 
out 
into 
the 
yard 
and, 
covering 
himself 
up 
head 
and 
all, 
lay
down 
in 
his 
carriage.





CHAPTER 
IX

Scarcely 
had 
Pierre 
laid 
his 
head 
on 
the 
pillow 
before 
he 
felt 
himself
falling 
asleep, 
but 
suddenly, 
almost 
with 
the 
distinctness 
of 
reality,
he 
heard 
the 
boom, 
boom, 
boom 
of 
firing, 
the 
thud 
of 
projectiles, 
groans
and 
cries, 
and 
smelled 
blood 
and 
powder, 
and 
a 
feeling 
of 
horror 
and
dread 
of 
death 
seized 
him. 
Filled 
with 
fright 
he 
opened 
his 
eyes 
and
lifted 
his 
head 
from 
under 
his 
cloak. 
All 
was 
tranquil 
in 
the 
yard. 
Only
someone's 
orderly 
passed 
through 
the 
gateway, 
splashing 
through 
the 
mud,
and 
talked 
to 
the 
innkeeper. 
Above 
Pierre's 
head 
some 
pigeons, 
disturbed
by 
the 
movement 
he 
had 
made 
in 
sitting 
up, 
fluttered 
under 
the 
dark 
roof
of 
the 
penthouse. 
The 
whole 
courtyard 
was 
permeated 
by 
a 
strong 
peaceful
smell 
of 
stable 
yards, 
delightful 
to 
Pierre 
at 
that 
moment. 
He 
could 
see
the 
clear 
starry 
sky 
between 
the 
dark<p>
roofs 
of 
two 
penthouses.

"Thank 
God, 
there 
is 
no 
more 
of 
that!" 
he 
thought, 
covering 
up 
his 
head
again. 
"Oh, 
what 
a 
terrible 
thing 
is 
fear, 
and 
how 
shamefully 
I 
yielded
to 
it! 
<a href="/cZl/qi7VEt8ddue3ka.html">But</a> 
they... 
they 
were 
steady 
and 
calm 
all 
the 
time, 
to 
the
end..." 
thought 
he.

They, 
<a href="/aVzUge/Bw7YWUw4H6trTR.html">in</a> 
Pierre's 
mind, 
were 
the 
soldiers, 
those 
who 
had 
been 
at 
the
battery, 
those 
who 
had 
given 
him 
food, 
and 
those 
who
