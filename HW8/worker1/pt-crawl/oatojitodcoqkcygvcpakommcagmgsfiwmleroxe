the 
external</h1>world 
of 
nature 
is 
only 
a 
certain
relation 
of 
the 
forces 
of 
nature 
to 
inevitability, 
or 
of 
the 
essence 
of
life 
to 
the 
laws 
of 
reason.

The 
great 
natural 
forces 
lie 
outside 
us 
and 
we 
are 
not 
conscious 
of
them; 
we 
call 
those 
forces 
gravitation, 
inertia, 
electricity, 
animal
force, 
and 
so 
on, 
but 
we 
are 
conscious 
of 
the 
force 
of<p>
life 
in 
man 
and
we 
call 
that 
freedom.

But 
just 
as 
the 
force 
of 
gravitation, 
incomprehensible 
in 
itself 
but
felt 
by 
every 
man, 
is 
understood 
by 
us 
only 
to 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
we
know 
the 
laws 
of 
inevitability 
to 
which 
it 
is 
subject 
(from 
the 
first
knowledge 
that 
all 
bodies 
have 
weight, 
up 
to 
Newton's 
law), 
so 
too 
the
force 
of 
free 
will, 
incomprehensible 
in 
itself 
but 
of 
which 
everyone 
is
conscious, 
is 
intelligible 
to 
us 
only 
in 
as 
far 
as 
we 
know 
the 
laws 
of
inevitability 
to 
which 
it 
is 
subject 
(from 
the 
fact 
that 
every 
man 
dies,
up 
to 
the 
knowledge 
of 
the 
most 
complex 
economic 
and 
historic 
laws).

All 
knowledge 
is 
merely 
a 
bringing 
of 
this 
essence 
of 
life 
under 
the
laws 
of 
reason.

Man's 
free 
will 
differs 
from 
every 
other 
force 
in 
that 
man 
is 
directly
conscious 
of 
it, 
but 
in 
the 
eyes 
of 
reason 
it 
in 
no 
way 
differs 
from
any 
other 
force. 
The 
forces 
of 
gravitation, 
electricity, 
or 
chemical
affinity 
are 
only 
distinguished 
from 
one 
another 
in 
that 
they<p>
are
differently 
defined 
by 
reason. 
Just 
so 
the 
force 
of 
man's 
free 
will
is 
distinguished 
by 
reason 
from 
the 
other 
forces 
of 
nature 
only 
by 
the
definition 
reason 
gives 
it. 
Freedom, 
apart 
from 
necessity, 
that 
is,
apart 
from 
the 
laws 
of 
reason 
that 
define 
it, 
differs 
in 
no 
way 
from
gravitation, 
or 
heat, 
or 
the 
force 
that 
makes 
things 
grow; 
for 
reason,
it 
is 
only 
a<p>
momentary 
undefinable 
sensation 
of 
life.

And 
as 
the 
undefinable 
essence 
of 
the 
force 
moving 
the 
heavenly 
bodies,
the 
undefinable 
essence 
of 
the 
forces 
of 
heat 
and 
electricity, 
or
of 
chemical 
affinity, 
or 
of 
the 
vital 
force, 
forms 
the 
content 
of
astronomy, 
physics, 
chemistry, 
botany, 
zoology, 
and 
so 
on, 
just 
in 
the
same 
way 
does 
the 
force 
of 
free 
will 
form<p>
the 
content 
of 
history.
But 
just 
as 
the 
subject 
of 
every 
science 
is 
the 
manifestation 
of 
this
unknown 
essence 
of 
life 
while 
that 
essence 
itself 
can 
only 
be 
the
subject 
of 
metaphysics, 
even 
the 
manifestation 
of 
the 
force 
of 
free 
will
in 
human 
beings 
in 
space, 
in 
time, 
and 
in 
dependence 
on 
cause 
forms
the 
subject 
of 
history, 
while 
free 
will 
itself 
is 
the 
subject 
of
metaphysics.

In 
the 
experimental 
sciences 
what 
we 
know 
we 
call 
the 
laws 
of
inevitability, 
what 
is 
unknown 
to 
us 
we 
call 
vital 
force. 
Vital 
force 
is
only 
an 
expression 
for 
the 
unknown 
remainder 
over 
and 
above 
what 
we 
know
of 
the 
essence 
of 
life.

So<p>
also 
in 
history 
what 
is 
known 
to 
us 
we 
call 
laws 
of 
inevitability,
what 
is 
unknown 
we 
call 
free 
will. 
Free 
will 
is 
for 
history 
only 
an
expression 
for 
the 
unknown 
remainder 
of 
what 
we 
know 
about 
the 
laws 
of
human 
life.
