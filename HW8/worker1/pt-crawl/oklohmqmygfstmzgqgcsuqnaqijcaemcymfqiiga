and</h1>noisily 
flapping 
their 
wings. 
Together 
with 
that 
sound
came 
a 
solitary 
human 
cry 
from 
the 
gateway 
and 
amid 
the 
smoke 
appeared
the 
figure 
of<p>
a 
bareheaded 
man 
in<p>
a 
peasant's 
coat. 
He 
grasped 
a 
musket
and 
took 
aim 
at 
the 
French. 
"Fire!" 
repeated 
the 
officer 
once 
more,
and 
the 
reports 
of 
a 
musket 
and 
of 
two 
cannon 
shots 
were 
heard
simultaneously. 
The 
gate 
was 
again 
hidden 
by 
smoke.

Nothing 
more 
stirred 
behind 
the 
screens 
and 
the 
French 
infantry 
soldiers
and 
officers 
advanced 
to 
the 
gate. 
In 
the 
gateway 
lay 
three 
wounded 
and
four 
dead. 
Two 
men 
in 
peasant 
coats 
ran 
away 
at 
the 
foot 
of 
the 
wall,
toward<p>
the 
Znamenka.

"Clear 
that 
away!" 
said 
the 
officer, 
pointing 
to 
the 
beams 
and 
the
corpses, 
and 
the 
French 
soldiers, 
after 
dispatching 
the 
wounded, 
threw
the 
corpses 
over 
the 
parapet.

Who 
these 
men 
were 
nobody 
knew. 
"Clear 
that 
away!" 
was 
all 
that 
was 
said
of 
them, 
and 
they 
were 
thrown 
over 
the 
parapet 
and 
removed 
later 
on 
that
they 
might 
not<p>
stink. 
Thiers 
alone 
dedicates 
a 
few 
eloquent 
lines 
to
their 
memory: 
"These 
wretches 
had 
occupied 
the 
sacred 
citadel, 
having
supplied 
themselves 
with 
<a href="/aVzUge/tKu9oqP1EMvs0G.html">guns</a> 
from 
the 
arsenal, 
and 
fired" 
(the
wretches) 
"at 
the 
French. 
Some 
of 
them 
were 
sabered 
and 
the 
Kremlin 
was
purged 
of 
their 
presence."

Murat 
was 
informed 
that 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ex5AyyZE1suDcq7kQqNG.html">way</a> 
had 
been 
cleared. 
The 
French 
entered
the 
gates 
and 
began 
pitching 
their 
camp 
in 
the 
Senate 
Square. 
Out 
of 
the
windows 
of 
the 
Senate 
House 
the 
soldiers 
threw 
chairs 
into 
the 
Square
for 
fuel 
and 
kindled 
fires 
there.

Other 
detachments 
passed 
through 
the<p>
Kremlin 
and 
encamped 
along
the 
Moroseyka, 
the 
Lubyanka, 
and 
Pokrovka 
Streets. 
Others 
quartered
themselves 
along 
the 
Vozdvizhenka, 
the 
Nikolski, 
and 
the 
Tverskoy
Streets. 
No 
masters 
of 
the 
houses 
being 
found 
anywhere, 
the 
French 
were
not 
billeted 
on 
the 
inhabitants 
as 
is 
usual 
in 
towns 
but 
lived 
in 
it 
as
in 
a 
camp.

Though 
tattered, 
hungry, 
worn 
out, 
and 
reduced 
to 
a 
third 
of 
their
original 
number, 
the 
French 
entered 
Moscow 
in 
good 
marching 
order. 
It
was 
a 
weary 
and 
famished, 
but 
still 
a 
fighting 
and 
menacing 
army. 
But
it 
remained 
an 
army 
only<p>
until 
its 
soldiers 
had 
dispersed 
into 
their
different 
lodgings. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
men 
of 
the 
various 
regiments 
began
to 
disperse 
among 
the 
wealthy 
and 
deserted 
houses, 
the 
army 
was 
lost
forever 
and 
there 
came 
into 
being 
something 
nondescript, 
neither
citizens 
nor 
soldiers 
but 
what 
are 
known 
as 
marauders. 
When 
five 
weeks
later 
these 
same 
men 
left 
Moscow, 
they 
no 
longer 
formed 
an 
army. 
They
were 
a 
mob<p>
of 
marauders, 
each 
carrying 
a 
quantity 
of 
articles 
which
seemed 
to 
him 
valuable 
or 
useful. 
The 
aim 
of 
each 
man 
when 
he 
left
Moscow 
was 
no 
longer, 
as 
it 
had 
been, 
to 
conquer, 
but 
merely 
to<p>
keep
what 
he 
had 
acquired. 
Like 
a 
monkey 
which 
puts 
its 
paw 
into 
the 
narrow
neck 
of 
a 
jug, 
and 
having 
seized 
a 
handful 
of 
nuts 
will 
not 
open 
its
fist 
for 
fear 
of 
losing 
what 
it 
holds, 
and 
therefore 
perishes, 
the
French 
when 
they 
left 
Moscow 
had 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rg15uFRs2Qc.html">inevitably</a> 
to 
perish 
because 
they
carried 
their 
loot 
with 
them, 
yet 
to 
abandon 
what 
they 
had 
stolen 
was 
as
impossible 
for 
them 
as 
it 
is 
for 
the 
monkey 
to 
open 
its 
paw<p>
and 
let
go 
of 
its 
nuts. 
Ten 
minutes 
after 
each 
regiment 
had 
entered 
a 
Moscow
district, 
not 
a 
soldier 
or 
officer 
was 
left. 
Men 
in 
military 
uniforms
and 
Hessian 
boots 
could 
be 
seen 
through 
the 
windows, 
laughing 
and
walking 
through 
the
