attacked 
Napoleon 
in 
the
center 
or 
on 
the 
right, 
and 
the 
engagement 
would 
have 
taken 
place 
on 
the
twenty-fifth, 
in 
the 
position 
we 
intended 
and 
had 
fortified. 
But 
as 
the
attack 
on 
our 
left 
flank 
took 
place 
in 
the 
evening 
after 
the 
retreat 
of
our 
rear 
guard 
(that 
is, 
immediately 
after 
the 
fight 
at 
Gridneva), 
and
as 
the 
Russian 
commanders 
<a href="/cZl/nZs6gcnoA49FW.html">did</a> 
not 
wish, 
or 
were 
not 
in 
time, 
to 
begin 
a
general 
engagement 
then 
on 
the 
evening 
of 
the 
twenty-fourth, 
the 
first
and 
chief 
action 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino 
was 
already 
lost 
on 
the
twenty-fourth, 
and 
obviously 
led 
to 
the 
loss 
of 
the 
one 
fought 
on 
the
twenty-sixth.

After 
the 
loss 
of 
the 
Shevardino 
Redoubt, 
we 
found 
ourselves 
on 
the
morning 
of 
the 
twenty-fifth 
without 
a 
position 
for 
our 
left 
flank, 
and
were 
forced 
to 
bend 
it 
back 
and 
hastily 
entrench 
it 
where 
it 
chanced 
to
be.

Not 
only 
was 
the 
Russian 
army 
on 
the 
twenty-sixth 
defended 
by 
weak,
unfinished 
entrenchments, 
but 
the 
disadvantage 
of 
that 
position 
was
increased 
by 
the 
fact 
that
