his 
hand, 
sometimes
touching 
his 
horse's 
side 
with 
his 
foot, 
or, 
without 
turning 
round,
handing 
a 
pipe 
he 
had 
finished 
to 
an 
hussar 
riding 
behind 
him, 
with 
as
calm 
and 
careless 
an 
air 
as 
though 
he 
were 
merely 
out 
for 
a 
ride. 
He
glanced 
with 
pity<p>
at 
the 
excited 
face 
of 
Ilyin, 
who<p>
talked 
much 
and 
in
great 
agitation. 
He 
knew 
from 
experience 
the 
tormenting 
expectation 
of
terror 
and 
death 
the 
cornet 
was 
suffering 
and 
knew 
that 
only 
time 
could
help 
him.

As 
soon 
as 
the 
sun 
appeared 
in 
a 
clear 
strip 
of 
sky 
beneath 
the 
clouds,
the 
wind 
<a href="/aVzUge/nI91hOZs9om.html">fell,</a> 
as 
if 
it 
dared 
not 
spoil 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
summer 
morning
after 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/jV9UybKc6JyP7PwKxs.html">storm;</a> 
drops 
still 
continued 
to 
fall, 
but 
vertically 
now, 
and
all 
was 
still. 
The 
whole 
sun 
appeared 
on 
the 
horizon 
and 
disappeared
behind 
a 
long 
narrow 
cloud 
that 
hung 
above 
it. 
A 
few 
minutes 
later 
it
reappeared 
brighter 
still 
from 
behind 
the 
top 
of 
the 
cloud, 
tearing 
its
edge. 
Everything 
grew 
bright 
and 
glittered. 
And 
with 
that 
light, 
and 
as
if 
in 
reply 
to 
it, 
came 
the 
sound 
of 
guns 
ahead 
of 
them.

Before 
Rostov 
<a href="/cZl/XH6HV6It6R.html">had</a> 
had 
time 
to 
consider 
and 
determine 
the 
distance 
of
that 
firing, 
Count 
Ostermann-Tolstoy's 
adjutant 
came 
galloping 
from
Vitebsk 
with 
orders 
to 
advance 
at 
a 
trot 
along 
the 
road.

The 
squadron 
overtook 
and 
passed 
the 
infantry 
and 
the 
battery-which 
had
also 
quickened 
their 
pace-rode 
down 
a 
hill,<p>
and 
passing<p>
through 
an 
empty
and 
deserted 
village 
again 
ascended. 
The 
horses 
began 
to 
lather 
and 
the
men 
to 
flush.

"Halt! 
Dress 
your 
ranks!" 
the 
order 
of 
the<p>
regimental 
commander 
was
heard 
ahead. 
"Forward 
by 
the 
left. 
Walk, 
march!" 
came 
the 
order 
from 
in
front.

And 
the 
hussars, 
passing 
along 
the 
line 
of 
troops 
on 
the 
left 
flank 
of
our 
position, 
halted 
behind 
our 
Uhlans 
who 
were 
in 
the 
front 
line. 
To
the<p>
right 
stood 
our 
infantry 
in 
a 
dense 
column: 
they 
were 
the 
reserve.
Higher 
up 
the 
hill, 
on 
the 
very 
horizon, 
our 
guns 
were 
visible 
through
the 
wonderfully 
clear 
air, 
brightly 
illuminated 
by 
slanting 
morning
sunbeams. 
In 
front, 
beyond 
a 
hollow 
dale, 
could 
be 
seen 
the 
enemy's
columns 
and 
guns. 
Our 
advanced 
line, 
already 
in 
action, 
could 
be 
heard
briskly 
exchanging 
shots 
with 
the 
enemy 
in 
the 
dale.

At 
these 
sounds, 
long 
<a href="/cZl/bER4STxex0Xjv5qrwB.html">unheard,</a> 
Rostov's 
spirits 
rose, 
as 
at 
the 
strains
of 
the 
merriest 
music. 
Trap-ta-ta-tap! 
cracked 
the 
shots, 
now 
together,
now 
several 
quickly 
one 
after 
another. 
Again 
all 
was<p>
silent 
and 
then
again 
it 
sounded 
as 
if 
someone 
were 
walking 
on 
detonators 
and 
exploding
them.

The 
hussars 
remained 
in 
the 
same 
place 
for 
about 
an 
hour. 
A 
cannonade
began. 
Count 
Ostermann 
with 
his 
suite 
rode 
up 
behind 
the 
squadron,
halted, 
spoke 
to 
the 
commander 
of 
the 
regiment, 
and 
rode 
up 
the 
hill 
to
the 
guns.

After 
Ostermann 
had 
gone, 
a 
command 
rang 
out 
to 
the 
Uhlans.
