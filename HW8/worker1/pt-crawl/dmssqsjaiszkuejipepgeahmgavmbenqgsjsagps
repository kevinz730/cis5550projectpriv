first 
asked 
many
questions: 
Where 
was 
he 
going? 
How 
was 
he 
wounded? 
Was 
it 
<a href="/aVzUge/au2EXJo3yFQ4.html">serious?</a> 
And
could 
she 
see 
him? 
But 
after 
she 
had 
been 
told 
that 
she 
could 
not 
see
him, 
that 
he 
was 
seriously 
wounded 
but 
that 
his 
life 
was 
not 
in 
danger,
she 
ceased 
to 
ask 
questions 
or 
to 
speak 
at 
all, 
evidently 
disbelieving
what 
they 
told 
her, 
and 
convinced 
that 
say 
what 
she 
might 
she 
would
still 
be 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/wU4UybKc56Lx.html">told</a> 
the 
same. 
All 
the 
way 
she 
had 
sat 
motionless 
in 
a 
corner
of 
the 
coach 
with 
wide 
open 
eyes, 
and 
the 
expression 
in 
them 
which 
the
countess 
knew 
so 
well 
and 
feared 
so 
much, 
and 
now 
she 
sat 
in 
the 
same
way 
on 
the 
bench 
where 
she 
had 
seated 
herself 
on 
arriving. 
She 
was
planning 
something 
and 
either 
deciding 
or 
had 
already 
decided 
something
in 
her 
mind. 
The 
countess 
knew 
this, 
but 
what 
it 
might 
be 
she 
did 
not
know, 
<a href="/cZl/kW5XT8UHdX0aJoR.html">and</a> 
this 
alarmed 
and 
tormented 
her.

"Natasha, 
undress, 
darling; 
lie 
down 
on 
my 
bed."

A 
bed 
had 
been 
made 
on 
a 
bedstead 
for 
the 
countess 
only. 
Madame 
Schoss
and 
the 
two 
girls 
were 
to 
sleep 
on 
some 
hay 
on 
the 
floor.

"No, 
Mamma, 
I 
will 
lie 
down 
here 
<a href="/cZl/pX1Xjv6mGGRm7rq.html">on</a> 
the 
floor," 
Natasha 
replied
irritably 
and 
she 
went 
to 
the 
window 
and 
opened 
it. 
Through 
<a href="/cZl/Bx1t0Sdo6HQTp.html">the</a> 
open
window 
the 
moans 
of 
the 
adjutant 
could 
be 
heard 
more 
distinctly. 
She 
put
her 
head 
out 
into 
the 
damp 
night 
air, 
and 
the 
countess 
saw 
her 
slim 
neck
shaking 
with 
sobs 
and 
throbbing 
against 
the 
window<p>
frame. 
Natasha 
knew
it 
was 
not 
Prince 
Andrew 
who 
was 
moaning. 
She 
knew 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
in
the 
same 
yard 
as 
themselves 
and 
in 
a 
part 
of 
the 
hut 
across 
the 
passage;
but 
this 
dreadful 
incessant 
moaning 
made 
her 
sob.
