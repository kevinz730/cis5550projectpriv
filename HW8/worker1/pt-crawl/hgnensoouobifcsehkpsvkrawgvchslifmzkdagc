"Come, 
get 
on!</h1>You 
shall 
have 
three 
rubles 
for
vodka-get 
on!" 
Rostov 
shouted, 
when 
the 
sleigh 
was 
only 
three
houses 
from 
his 
door. 
It 
seemed 
to 
him 
the 
horses 
were 
not 
moving 
at
all. 
At 
last 
the 
sleigh 
bore 
to 
the 
right, 
drew 
up 
at 
an 
entrance, 
and
Rostov 
saw 
overhead 
the 
old 
familiar 
cornice 
with 
a 
bit 
of 
plaster
broken 
off, 
the 
porch, 
and 
the 
post 
by 
the 
side 
of 
the 
pavement. 
He
sprang 
out 
before 
the 
sleigh 
stopped, 
and<p>
ran 
into 
the 
hall. 
The 
house
stood 
cold 
and 
silent, 
as 
if 
quite 
regardless 
of 
who 
had 
come 
to 
it.
There 
was 
no 
one 
in 
the 
hall. 
"Oh 
God! 
Is 
everyone 
all 
right?"
he 
thought, 
stopping 
for 
a 
moment 
with 
a 
sinking 
heart, 
and 
then
immediately 
starting 
to 
run 
along 
the 
hall 
and 
up 
the 
warped 
steps 
of
the 
familiar 
staircase. 
The 
well-known 
old<p>
door 
handle, 
which 
always
angered 
the 
countess 
when 
it 
was 
not 
properly 
cleaned, 
turned 
as 
loosely
as 
ever. 
A 
solitary 
tallow 
candle 
burned 
in 
the 
anteroom.

Old 
Michael 
was 
asleep 
on 
the 
chest.<p>
Prokofy,<p>
the 
footman, 
who 
was
so 
strong 
that 
he 
could 
lift 
the 
back 
of 
the 
carriage 
from 
behind, 
sat
plaiting 
slippers 
out 
of 
cloth 
selvedges. 
He 
looked 
up 
at 
the 
opening
door 
and 
his 
expression 
of 
sleepy 
indifference 
suddenly 
changed 
to 
one
of 
delighted 
amazement.

"Gracious 
heavens! 
The 
young 
count!" 
he 
cried, 
recognizing 
his
young 
master. 
"Can 
it 
be? 
My<p>
treasure!" 
and 
Prokofy,
