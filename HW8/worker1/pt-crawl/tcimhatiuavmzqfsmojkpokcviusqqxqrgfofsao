Peterhof, 
receiving 
Speranski 
every 
day 
and 
no
one 
else. 
At 
that 
time 
the 
two 
famous 
decrees 
were 
being 
prepared
that 
so 
agitated 
society-abolishing 
court 
ranks 
and 
introducing
examinations 
to 
qualify 
for 
the 
grades 
of 
Collegiate 
Assessor 
and
State 
Councilor-and 
not 
merely 
these 
but 
a 
whole 
state<p>
constitution,
intended 
to 
change 
the 
existing 
order 
of 
government 
in 
Russia: 
legal,
administrative, 
and 
financial, 
from 
the 
Council 
of 
State 
down 
to 
the
district 
tribunals. 
Now 
those 
vague 
liberal 
dreams 
with 
which 
the
Emperor 
Alexander 
had 
ascended 
the 
throne, 
and 
which 
he 
had 
tried 
to 
put
into 
effect 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
his 
associates, 
Czartoryski, 
Novosiltsev,
Kochubey, 
and 
Strogonov-whom 
he 
himself 
in<p>
jest 
had 
called 
his
Comite 
de 
salut 
public-were 
taking 
shape 
and 
being 
realized.

Now 
all 
these 
men 
were 
replaced 
by 
Speranski 
on 
the 
civil 
side, 
and
Arakcheev 
on 
the 
military. 
Soon 
after 
his 
arrival 
Prince 
Andrew, 
as 
a
gentleman 
of 
the 
chamber, 
presented 
himself 
at 
court 
and 
at 
a 
levee. 
The
Emperor, 
though 
he 
met 
him 
twice, 
did 
not 
favor 
him 
with 
a 
single 
word.
It 
had 
always 
seemed 
to 
Prince 
Andrew 
before 
that 
he 
was 
antipathetic
to 
the 
Emperor 
and<p>
that 
the 
latter 
disliked 
his 
face 
and 
personality
generally, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/JU9RPq9tiRgR9b.html">and</a> 
<a href="/cZl/UxO6pSZHI5cLYU2qjYtS.html">in</a> 
the 
cold, 
repellent 
glance 
the 
Emperor 
gave 
him, 
he
now 
found 
further 
confirmation 
of 
this 
surmise. 
The 
courtiers 
explained
the 
Emperor's 
neglect 
of 
him 
by 
His 
Majesty's 
displeasure 
at
Bolkonski's 
not 
having 
served 
since 
1805.

"I 
know 
myself 
that 
one 
cannot 
help 
one's 
sympathies 
and
antipathies," 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"so 
it 
will 
not 
do 
to 
present
my 
proposal<p>
for 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
army
