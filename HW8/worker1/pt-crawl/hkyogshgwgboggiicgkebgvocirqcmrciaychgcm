men 
of 
the 
same 
kind</h1>hiding 
in 
the<p>
shadow 
of 
the 
house 
on 
both 
sides.
But 
neither 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
nor 
the 
footman 
nor 
the 
coachman, 
who
could 
not 
help 
seeing 
these 
people, 
took 
any 
notice 
of 
them. 
"It 
seems
to 
be 
all 
right," 
Pierre 
concluded, 
and 
followed 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna.
She 
hurriedly 
ascended 
the 
narrow 
dimly 
lit 
stone 
staircase, 
calling 
to
Pierre, 
who 
was 
lagging 
behind, 
to 
follow. 
Though 
he 
<a href="/aVzUge/WC6zmeD7cYy0.html">did</a> 
not 
see 
why 
it
was 
necessary 
for 
him 
to 
go 
to 
the 
count 
at 
all, 
still 
less 
why<p>
he 
had
to 
go 
by 
the 
back 
stairs, 
yet 
judging 
by 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna's 
air
of 
assurance 
and 
haste, 
Pierre 
concluded 
that 
it 
was 
all 
absolutely
necessary. 
Halfway 
up<p>
the 
stairs 
they 
were 
almost 
knocked 
over 
by
some 
men 
who, 
carrying 
pails, 
came 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vh5UTE21.html">running</a> 
downstairs, 
their 
boots
clattering. 
These 
men 
pressed 
close 
to 
the 
wall 
to 
let 
Pierre 
and 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
pass 
and 
did 
not 
evince 
the 
least 
surprise 
at 
seeing 
them
there.

"Is 
this 
the 
way 
to 
the 
princesses' 
apartments?" 
asked 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
of 
one 
of 
them.

"Yes," 
replied 
a 
footman 
in 
a 
bold 
loud 
voice, 
as 
if 
anything 
were
now 
permissible; 
"the 
door 
to 
the 
left, 
ma'am."

"Perhaps 
the 
count 
did 
not 
ask 
for 
me," 
said 
Pierre 
when 
he 
reached
the 
landing. 
"I'd 
better 
go 
to 
my 
own 
room."

Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
paused 
and 
waited 
for 
him 
to 
come 
up.

"Ah, 
my 
friend!" 
she 
said, 
touching 
his 
<a href="/cZl/xN150Ptam.html">arm</a> 
as 
she 
had 
done 
her
son's 
when 
speaking 
to 
him 
that 
afternoon, 
"believe 
me 
I 
suffer 
no
less 
than 
you 
do, 
but 
be 
a 
man!"

"But 
really, 
hadn't 
I 
better 
go 
away?" 
he 
asked, 
looking 
kindly 
at
her 
over 
his 
spectacles.

"Ah, 
my 
dear 
friend! 
Forget 
the 
wrongs 
that 
may 
have 
been 
done 
you.
Think 
that 
he 
is 
your 
father 
... 
perhaps 
in 
the 
agony 
of 
death." 
She
sighed. 
"I 
have 
loved 
you 
like 
a 
son 
from 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tHL2iU9hxx7.html">first.</a> 
Trust 
yourself 
to
me, 
Pierre. 
I 
shall 
not 
forget 
your 
interests."

Pierre 
did 
not 
understand 
a 
word, 
but 
the 
conviction 
that 
all 
this 
had
to 
be 
grew 
stronger, 
and 
he 
meekly 
followed 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna
