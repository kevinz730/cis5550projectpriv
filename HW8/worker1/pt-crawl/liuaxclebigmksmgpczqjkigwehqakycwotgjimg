the 
loud 
shouting 
continued 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hI3tc2BnCGW3iLv.html">for</a> 
a 
long 
time. 
When 
the
voices 
subsided, 
the 
footmen 
cleared 
away 
the 
broken 
glass 
and 
everybody
sat 
down 
again, 
smiling 
at 
the 
noise 
they 
had 
made 
and 
exchanging
remarks. 
The 
old 
count 
rose 
once 
more, 
glanced 
at 
a 
note 
lying 
beside
his 
plate, 
and 
proposed 
a 
toast, 
"To 
<a href="/cZl/Ga6ws1ogilO4rhMF.html">the</a> 
health 
of<p>
the 
hero 
of 
our
last 
campaign, 
Prince 
Peter 
Ivanovich 
Bagration!" 
and 
again 
his 
blue
eyes 
grew 
moist. 
"Hurrah!" 
cried 
the 
three 
hundred 
<a href="/aVzUge/Uo1Eh4xgX7ZMYAE.html">voices</a> 
again,
but 
instead 
of 
the 
band 
a 
choir 
began 
singing 
a 
cantata 
composed 
by 
Paul
Ivanovich 
Kutuzov:

 
 
 
Russians! 
O'er 
all 
<a href="/cZl/XT9mDKi0HwD5ogArh.html">barriers</a> 
on!
