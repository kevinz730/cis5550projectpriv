"Murderer!" 
he</h1>shouted 
suddenly 
to 
the 
publican. 
"Bind 
him, 
lads!"

"I 
daresay 
you 
would 
like 
to 
bind 
me!" 
shouted 
the 
publican, 
pushing
away 
the 
men 
advancing 
on 
him, 
and 
snatching 
his 
cap 
from 
his 
head 
he
flung 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/HB95NtgpO1Xs.html">it</a> 
on 
the 
ground.

As 
if 
this 
action 
had 
some 
mysterious 
and 
menacing 
significance, 
the
workmen 
surrounding 
the 
publican 
paused 
in 
indecision.

"I 
know 
the 
law 
very 
well, 
mates! 
I'll 
take 
the 
matter 
to 
the 
captain
of 
police. 
You 
think 
I 
won't 
get 
to 
him? 
Robbery 
is 
not 
permitted 
to
anybody 
nowadays!" 
shouted 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/tm7XT3R.html">publican,</a><p>
picking 
up 
his 
cap.

"Come 
along 
then! 
Come 
along 
then!" 
the 
publican 
and 
the 
tall 
young
fellow 
repeated 
one 
after 
the 
other, 
and 
they 
moved 
up 
the 
street
together.

The 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ew6HAJD7Nqwe1.html">bloodstained</a> 
smith 
went 
beside 
them. 
The 
factory 
hands 
and 
others
followed 
behind, 
talking 
and 
shouting.

At 
the 
corner 
of 
the 
Moroseyka, 
opposite 
a 
large 
house 
with 
closed
shutters 
and 
bearing 
a 
bootmaker's 
signboard, 
stood<p>
a 
score 
of 
thin,
worn-out, 
gloomy-faced 
bootmakers, 
wearing 
overalls 
and 
long 
tattered
coats.

"He 
should 
pay 
folks 
off 
properly," 
a 
thin 
workingman, 
with 
frowning
brows 
and 
a 
straggly 
beard, 
was 
saying.

"But 
he's 
sucked 
our 
blood 
and 
now 
he 
thinks 
he's 
quit 
of 
us. 
He's 
been
misleading 
us 
all 
the 
week 
and 
now 
that 
he's 
brought 
us 
to 
this 
pass
he's 
made 
off."

On 
seeing 
the 
crowd 
and 
the 
bloodstained 
man 
the 
workman 
ceased
speaking, 
and 
with 
eager 
curiosity 
all 
the 
bootmakers 
joined 
the 
moving
crowd.

"Where 
are 
all 
the 
folks 
going?"

"Why, 
to 
the 
police, 
of 
course!"

"I 
say, 
is 
it 
true 
that 
we 
have 
been 
beaten?" 
"And 
what 
did 
you 
think?
Look 
what 
folks 
are 
saying."

Questions 
and 
answers 
were 
heard. 
The 
publican, 
taking 
advantage 
of 
the
increased 
crowd, 
dropped 
behind 
and 
returned 
to 
his 
tavern.

The 
tall 
youth, 
not 
noticing 
the 
disappearance 
of 
his 
foe, 
waved 
his
bare 
arm 
and 
went 
on 
talking 
incessantly, 
attracting 
general 
attention
to 
himself. 
It 
was 
around 
him 
that 
the 
people 
chiefly<p>
crowded, 
expecting
answers 
from 
him 
to 
the 
questions 
that 
occupied 
all 
their 
minds.

"He 
must 
keep 
<a href="/cZl/QD1GyPl1AXKw0WIAaD.html">order,</a> 
keep 
the 
law, 
that's 
what 
the 
government 
is 
there
for. 
Am 
I 
not 
right, 
good 
Christians?" 
said 
the 
tall 
youth, 
with 
a
scarcely 
perceptible 
smile. 
"He 
thinks 
there's 
no 
government! 
How 
can
one 
do 
without 
government? 
Or 
else 
there 
would 
be 
plenty 
who'd 
rob 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/JM35pufMC1SUDH.html">us."

"Why</a> 
talk 
nonsense?" 
rejoined 
voices 
in 
the 
crowd. 
"Will 
they 
give
up 
Moscow 
like 
this? 
They 
told 
you 
that 
for 
fun, 
and 
you 
believed 
it!
Aren't 
there 
plenty 
of 
troops 
on 
the 
march? 
Let 
him 
in, 
indeed! 
That's
what 
the 
government 
is 
for. 
You'd 
better 
listen 
to 
what 
people 
are
saying," 
said 
some 
of 
the 
mob 
pointing 
to 
the 
tall 
youth.

By 
the 
wall 
of 
China-Town 
a 
smaller 
group 
of 
people 
were 
gathered 
round
