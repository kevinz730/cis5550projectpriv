turned 
to 
the

"I 
can 
just 
imagine 
what 
a 
funny 
figure 
that 
policeman
cut!"

And 
as 
he 
waved 
his 
arms 
to 
impersonate 
the 
policeman, 
his 
portly 
form
again 
shook 
with 
a 
deep 
ringing 
laugh, 
the 
laugh 
of 
one 
who 
always 
eats
well 
and, 
in 
particular, 
drinks 
well. 
"So 
do 
come

CHAPTER 
XI

Silence 
ensued. 
The 
countess 
looked 
at 
her 
callers, 
smiling 
affably,
but 
not 
concealing 
the 
fact 
that 
she 
would 
not 
be 
distressed 
if 
they
now 
rose 
and 
took 
their 
leave. 
The 
visitor's 
daughter 
was 
already
smoothing 
down 
her 
dress 
with 
an 
inquiring<p>
look 
at 
her 
mother, 
when
suddenly 
from 
the 
next 
room 
were 
heard 
the 
footsteps 
of 
boys 
and 
girls
running 
to 
the 
door 
and 
the 
noise 
of 
a 
chair 
falling 
over, 
and 
a 
girl
of 
thirteen, 
hiding<p>
something 
in 
the 
folds 
of 
her 
short 
muslin 
frock,
darted 
in 
and 
stopped 
short 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room. 
It 
was 
evident
that 
she 
had 
not 
intended 
her 
flight 
to 
bring 
her 
so 
far. 
Behind 
her 
in
the 
doorway 
appeared 
a 
student 
with 
a 
crimson 
coat 
collar, 
an 
officer
of 
the 
Guards, 
a 
girl 
of 
fifteen, 
and 
a 
plump 
rosy-faced 
boy 
in 
a 
short
jacket.

The 
count 
jumped 
up<p>
and, 
swaying 
from 
side 
to 
side, 
spread 
his 
arms 
wide
and 
threw 
them 
<a href="/cZl/ZV2ieWTn42LcEl.html">round</a> 
the 
little 
girl 
who 
had 
run 
in.

"Ah, 
here 
she 
is!" 
he 
exclaimed 
laughing. 
"My 
pet, 
whose 
name 
day
it<p>
is. 
My 
dear 
pet!"

"Ma 
chere, 
there 
is 
a 
time 
for 
everything," 
said 
the 
countess 
with
feigned 
severity. 
"You 
spoil 
her, 
Ilya," 
she 
added, 
turning<p>
to 
her
husband.

"How 
do 
you 
do, 
my 
dear? 
I 
wish 
you 
many 
happy 
returns 
of 
your 
name
day," 
said 
the 
visitor. 
"What 
a 
charming 
child," 
she 
added,
addressing 
the 
mother.
