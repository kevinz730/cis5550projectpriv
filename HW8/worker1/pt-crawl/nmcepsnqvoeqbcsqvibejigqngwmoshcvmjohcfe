which</h1>wounded 
men 
began 
to 
come 
into 
the
Rostovs' 
yard. 
Many 
of 
the 
wounded 
asked 
them 
not 
to 
unload 
the 
carts
but 
only 
to 
let 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tiR9CWm3gi4.html">them</a> 
sit 
on 
the 
top 
of 
the 
things. 
But 
the 
work 
of
unloading, 
once 
started, 
could 
not 
be 
arrested. 
It 
seemed 
not 
to 
matter
whether 
all 
or 
only 
half 
the<p>
things 
were 
left 
behind. 
Cases 
full 
of
china, 
bronzes, 
pictures, 
and 
mirrors 
that 
had 
been 
so 
carefully
packed 
the 
night 
before 
now 
lay 
about 
the 
yard, 
and 
still 
they 
went 
on
searching 
for 
and 
finding 
possibilities 
of 
unloading 
this 
or 
that 
and
letting 
the 
wounded 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bZD3byQW2qvKp6R.html">have</a> 
another 
and 
yet 
another 
cart.

"We 
can 
take 
four 
more 
men," 
<a href="/aVzUge/gc6fU5ZhuM4.html">said</a> 
the 
steward. 
"They 
can 
have 
my 
trap,
or 
else 
what 
is 
to 
become 
of 
them?"

"Let 
them 
have 
<a href="/cZl/Wu8BwOO0yf1EAct.html">my</a> 
wardrobe 
cart," 
said 
the 
countess. 
"Dunyasha 
can 
go
with 
me 
in 
the 
carriage."

They 
unloaded 
the 
wardrobe 
cart 
and 
sent 
it 
to 
take 
wounded 
men
