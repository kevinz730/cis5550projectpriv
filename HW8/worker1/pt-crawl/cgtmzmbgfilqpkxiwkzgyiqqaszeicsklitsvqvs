such 
pleasant,
refined 
ways, 
and 
the</h1>state 
of 
dove-like 
purity 
she 
was 
now 
in 
(she 
wore
only 
white 
<a href="/aVzUge/xr1N9P2.html">dresses</a> 
and 
white 
ribbons 
all 
that 
time) 
gave 
her 
pleasure,
but 
her 
pleasure 
did 
not 
cause 
her 
for 
a 
moment 
to 
forget 
her 
aim. 
And
as 
it 
always 
happens 
in 
contests 
of 
cunning 
that 
a 
stupid 
person 
gets
the 
better 
of

ones,<p>
Helene-having 
realized 
that 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/LN8bju0.html">main</a> 
object
of 
all 
these 
words 
and 
all 
this 
trouble 
was, 
after 
converting 
her 
to
Catholicism, 
to 
obtain 
money 
from 
her 
for 
Jesuit 
institutions 
(as 
to
which 
she 
received 
indications)-before 
parting 
with 
her 
money 
insisted
that 
the 
various 
operations 
necessary 
to 
free<p>
her 
from 
her 
husband
should 
be 
performed. 
In 
her 
view 
the 
aim 
of 
every 
religion 
was 
merely
to 
preserve 
certain 
proprieties 
while 
affording 
satisfaction 
to
human 
desires. 
And 
with 
this 
aim, 
in 
one 
of 
her 
talks 
with 
her 
Father
Confessor, 
she 
insisted 
on 
an 
answer 
to 
the 
question, 
in 
how 
far 
was 
she
bound 
by 
her 
marriage?

They 
were 
sitting 
in 
the 
twilight 
by 
a 
window 
in 
the 
drawing 
room.
The 
scent 
of 
flowers 
came 
in 
at 
the 
window. 
Helene 
was 
wearing 
a 
white
dress, 
transparent 
over 
her 
shoulders 
and 
bosom. 
The 
abbe, 
a 
well-fed
man 
with 
a 
plump, 
clean-shaven 
chin, 
a 
pleasant 
firm 
mouth, 
and 
white
hands<p>
meekly 
folded 
on 
his 
knees, 
sat 
close 
to 
Helene 
and, 
with 
a
subtle 
smile 
on 
his 
lips 
and 
a 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/OuD6Nz3N4KA.html">peaceful</a> 
look 
of 
delight 
at 
her 
beauty,
occasionally 
glanced 
at 
her 
face 
as 
he 
explained 
his 
opinion 
on 
the
subject. 
Helene 
with 
an 
uneasy 
smile 
looked 
at 
his 
curly 
hair 
and 
his
plump, 
clean-shaven, 
blackish 
cheeks 
and 
every 
moment 
expected 
the
conversation 
to 
take 
a 
fresh 
turn. 
But 
the 
abbe, 
though 
he 
evidently
enjoyed 
the 
beauty 
of 
his 
companion, 
was 
absorbed 
in 
his 
mastery 
of 
the
matter.

The 
course 
of 
the 
Father 
Confessor's 
arguments 
ran 
as 
follows: 
"Ignorant
of 
the 
import 
of 
what 
you 
were 
undertaking, 
you 
made 
a 
vow 
of 
conjugal
fidelity 
to 
a 
man 
who 
on 
his 
part, 
by 
entering 
the 
married 
state 
without
faith 
in 
the 
religious 
significance 
of 
marriage, 
committed 
an 
act 
of
sacrilege. 
That 
marriage 
lacked 
the 
dual 
significance 
it 
should 
have
had. 
Yet 
in 
spite 
of 
this 
your 
vow 
was 
binding. 
You 
swerved 
from 
it.
What 
did 
you 
commit 
by 
so 
acting? 
A 
venial, 
or 
a 
mortal, 
sin? 
A 
venial
sin, 
for 
you 
acted 
without 
evil 
intention. 
If 
now 
you 
married<p>
again
with 
the 
object 
of 
bearing 
children, 
your 
sin 
might 
be 
forgiven. 
But 
the
question 
is 
again 
a 
twofold 
one: 
firstly..."

But 
suddenly 
Helene, 
who 
was 
getting 
bored, 
said<p>
with 
one 
of 
her
bewitching 
smiles: 
"But 
I 
think 
that 
having 
espoused 
the 
true 
religion 
I
cannot 
be 
bound 
by 
what 
a 
false 
religion 
laid
