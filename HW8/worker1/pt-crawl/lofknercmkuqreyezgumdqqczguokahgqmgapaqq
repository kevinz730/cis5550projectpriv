"I 
have 
now 
quite 
settled 
in 
my 
new 
rooms, 
Count" 
(Berg 
said
this 
with 
perfect 
conviction 
that 
this 
information 
could 
not 
but 
be
agreeable), 
"and 
so 
I 
wish 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Lg86kK6Iofp.html">to</a> 
arrange 
just 
a 
small 
party 
for 
my 
own
and 
my 
wife's 
friends." 
(He 
smiled 
still 
more 
pleasantly.) 
"I
wished 
to 
ask 
the 
countess 
and 
you 
to 
do 
me 
the 
honor 
of 
coming 
to 
tea
and 
to 
supper."

Only 
Countess 
Helene, 
considering 
the 
society 
of<p>
such 
people 
as 
the
Bergs 
beneath 
her, 
could 
be 
<a href="/cZl/kt2kz2w9dJM.html">cruel</a> 
enough 
to 
refuse 
such 
an 
invitation.
Berg 
explained 
so 
clearly 
why 
he 
wanted 
to 
collect 
at<p>
his 
house<p>
a 
small
but 
select 
company, 
and 
why 
this 
would 
give 
him 
pleasure, 
and 
why 
though
he 
grudged 
spending 
money 
on 
cards 
or 
anything 
harmful, 
he 
was 
prepared
to 
run 
into 
some 
expense 
for 
the 
sake 
of<p>
good 
society-that 
Pierre
could 
not 
refuse, 
and 
promised 
to 
come.

"But 
don't 
be 
late, 
Count, 
if 
I 
may 
venture 
to 
ask; 
about 
ten
minutes 
to 
eight, 
please. 
We 
shall 
make 
up 
a 
rubber. 
Our 
general 
is
coming. 
He 
is 
very 
good 
to 
me. 
We 
shall 
have 
supper, 
Count. 
So 
you 
will
do 
me 
the 
favor."

Contrary 
to 
his 
habit 
of 
being 
late, 
Pierre 
on 
that 
day 
arrived 
at 
the
Bergs' 
house, 
not 
at 
ten 
but 
at 
fifteen 
minutes 
to 
eight.

Having 
prepared 
everything 
necessary 
for 
the 
party, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/gl6U83vGF.html">the</a> 
Bergs 
were 
ready
for 
their 
guests' 
arrival.

In 
their 
new, 
clean, 
and 
light 
study 
with 
its 
small 
busts 
and 
pictures
and 
new 
furniture 
sat 
Berg 
and 
his 
wife. 
Berg, 
closely 
buttoned 
up 
in
his 
new 
uniform, 
sat 
beside 
his 
wife 
explaining 
to 
her 
that 
one 
always
could 
and 
should 
be 
acquainted 
with 
people 
above 
one, 
because 
only 
then
does 
one 
get 
satisfaction<p>
from 
acquaintances.

"You 
can 
get 
to 
know 
something, 
you 
can 
ask 
for 
something. 
See 
how 
I
managed 
from 
my 
first 
promotion." 
(Berg 
measured 
his 
life 
not 
by 
years
but 
by 
promotions.) 
"My 
comrades 
are 
still 
nobodies, 
while 
I 
am 
only
waiting 
for 
a 
vacancy 
to 
command 
a 
regiment, 
and 
have 
the 
happiness 
to
be 
your 
husband." 
(He 
rose 
and 
kissed 
Vera's 
hand, 
and 
on 
the 
way
to 
her 
straightened 
out 
a 
turned-up 
corner 
of 
the 
carpet.) 
"And
how 
have 
I 
obtained 
all 
this? 
Chiefly 
by 
knowing 
how 
to 
choose 
my
aquaintances. 
It 
goes 
without 
saying 
that 
one 
must 
be 
conscientious 
and
methodical."

Berg 
smiled 
with 
a 
sense<p>
of 
his 
superiority 
over 
a 
weak 
woman, 
and
paused, 
reflecting 
that 
this 
dear 
wife 
of 
his 
was 
after<p>
all 
but 
a 
weak
woman 
who 
could 
not 
understand 
all 
that 
constitutes 
a 
man's 
dignity,
what 
it 
was 
ein 
Mann 
zu 
sein. 
* 
Vera 
at 
the 
same 
time 
smiling 
<a href="/aVzUge/Zo3on9R8.html">with</a> 
a
sense 
of 
superiority 
over 
her 
good, 
conscientious 
husband, 
who 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oG7Xiis3zmeD3.html">all</a> 
the
same 
understood 
life 
wrongly, 
as 
according 
to 
Vera 
all 
men 
did. 
Berg,
judging 
by 
his 
wife, 
thought 
all 
women 
weak 
and 
foolish. 
Vera, 
judging
only 
by 
her 
husband 
and 
generalizing 
from 
that 
observation, 
supposed
that 
all 
men,<p>

they
