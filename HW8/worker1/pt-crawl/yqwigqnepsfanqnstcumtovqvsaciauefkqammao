Early 
in 
the 
year</h1>1806 
Nicholas 
Rostov 
returned 
home 
on 
leave. 
Denisov
was 
going 
home 
to 
Voronezh 
and 
Rostov 
persuaded 
him 
to 
travel 
with 
him
as 
far 
as 
Moscow 
and 
to 
stay 
with 
him 
<a href="/aVzUge/HK3WVP4FWU2At.html">there.</a> 
Meeting 
a 
comrade 
at
the 
last 
post 
station 
but 
one 
before 
Moscow, 
Denisov 
had 
drunk 
three
bottles 
of 
wine 
with 
him 
and, 
despite 
the 
jolting 
ruts 
across 
the
snow-covered 
road, 
did 
not 
once 
wake 
up 
on 
the 
way 
to 
Moscow, 
but 
lay
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
sleigh 
beside 
Rostov, 
who 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/di6HV1ohMq7NSCk.html">grew</a> 
more 
and 
more
impatient 
the 
nearer 
they 
got 
to 
Moscow.
