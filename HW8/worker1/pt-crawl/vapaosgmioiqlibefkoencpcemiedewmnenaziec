and 
he 
indicated 
with 
his 
delicate 
fingers 
what 
he 
meant 
by 
a 
pinch.

"Dere 
has 
neffer 
been 
a 
gase," 
a 
German 
doctor 
was 
saying<p>
to 
an
aide-de-camp, 
"dat 
one 
liffs 
after 
de 
sird 
stroke."

"And 
what 
a 
well-preserved 
man 
he 
was!" 
remarked 
the 
aide-de-camp.
"And 
who 
will 
inherit 
his 
wealth?" 
he 
added 
in 
a 
whisper.

"It 
von't 
go 
begging," 
replied 
the 
German 
with 
a 
smile.

Everyone 
again 
looked 
toward 
the 
door, 
<a href="/cZl/UrT8C9b1.html">which</a> 
creaked 
as 
the 
second
princess 
went 
in 
with 
the 
drink 
she 
had 
prepared 
according 
to
Lorrain's 
instructions. 
The 
German 
doctor 
went 
up 
to 
Lorrain.

"Do 
you 
think 
he 
can 
last 
till 
morning?" 
asked 
the 
German,
addressing 
Lorrain 
in 
French 
which 
he 
pronounced 
badly.

Lorrain, 
pursing 
up 
his 
lips, 
waved 
a 
severely 
negative 
finger 
before
his 
nose.

"Tonight, 
not 
later," 
said 
he 
in 
a 
low 
voice, 
and 
he 
moved 
away
with 
a 
decorous 
smile 
of 
self-satisfaction 
at 
being 
able 
clearly 
to
understand 
and 
state 
the 
patient's 
condition.

Meanwhile 
Prince 
Vasili 
had 
opened 
the 
door<p>
into 
the 
princess' 
room.

In<p>
this 
room 
it 
was 
almost 
dark; 
only 
two 
tiny 
lamps 
were 
burning 
before
the 
icons 
and 
there 
was 
a 
pleasant 
scent 
of 
flowers 
and 
burnt 
pastilles.
The 
room 
was 
crowded 
with 
small 
pieces 
of 
furniture, 
whatnots,
cupboards, 
and 
little 
tables. 
The 
quilt 
of 
a 
high, 
white 
feather 
bed 
was
just 
visible 
behind 
a 
screen. 
A 
small 
dog 
began 
to 
bark.

"Ah, 
is 
it 
you, 
cousin?"

She 
rose 
and 
smoothed 
her 
hair, 
which 
was 
as 
usual 
so 
extremely 
smooth
that 
it 
seemed 
to 
be 
made 
of 
one 
piece 
with 
her<p>
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Yv7tA1IgdEd9UybKc.html">head</a> 
and 
covered 
with
varnish.

"Has 
anything 
happened?" 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vi2Pe7QJprO9e.html">she</a> 
asked. 
"I 
am 
so 
terrified."

"No, 
there 
is 
no 
change. 
I 
only 
came 
to 
have 
a 
talk 
about 
business,
Catiche," 
* 
muttered 
the 
prince, 
seating<p>
himself 
wearily 
on 
the 
chair
she 
had 
just 
vacated. 
"You 
have 
made 
the 
place 
warm, 
I 
must 
say," 
he
remarked. 
"Well, 
sit 
down: 
let's 
have 
a 
talk."

 
 
 
 
 
*Catherine.

"I 
thought 
perhaps 
something 
had 
happened," 
she 
said 
with 
her
unchanging 
stonily 
severe 
expression; 
and, 
sitting 
<a href="/cZl/uI3zT3Dj7dS.html">down</a> 
opposite 
the
prince, 
she 
prepared 
to 
listen.

"I 
wished 
to 
get 
a 
nap, 
mon 
cousin, 
but 
I 
can't."

"Well, 
my 
dear?" 
said 
Prince 
Vasili, 
taking 
her 
hand 
and 
bending 
it
downwards 
as 
was 
his 
habit.

It 
was 
plain 
that 
this 
"well?" 
referred 
to 
much 
that 
they 
both
understood 
without 
naming.

The 
princess, 
who 
had 
a 
straight, 
rigid 
body, 
abnormally 
long 
for 
her
legs, 
looked 
directly 
at 
Prince 
Vasili 
with 
no 
sign 
of 
emotion 
in 
her
prominent 
gray 
eyes. 
Then 
she 
shook 
her 
head 
and 
glanced 
up 
at 
the 
icons
with 
a 
sigh. 
This 
might 
have 
been 
taken 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
sorrow
and 
devotion, 
or 
of 
weariness 
and 
<a href="/cZl/RWI879PvrsB.html">hope</a> 
of 
resting 
before 
long. 
Prince
Vasili 
understood 
it 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
weariness.

"And 
I?" 
he 
said; 
"do 
you 
think 
it 
is 
easier 
for 
me? 
I 
am 
as 
worn
out 
as 
a 
post 
horse, 
but 
still 
I 
must 
have 
a 
talk 
with 
you, 
Catiche, 
a
very 
serious 
talk."

Prince 
Vasili 
said 
no 
more 
and 
his 
cheeks 
began 
to 
twitch 
nervously,
now 
on 
one 
side, 
now 
on 
the 
other, 
giving 
his 
face 
an 
unpleasant
expression 
which 
was 
never 
to 
be 
seen 
on 
it 
in 
a 
drawing 
room. 
His 
eyes
too 
seemed 
strange; 
at 
one 
moment 
they 
looked
