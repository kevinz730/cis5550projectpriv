she 
heard
her 
mother 
praying 
and 
sighing 
and 
the 
creaking 
of 
her 
bed 
under
her, 
then 
Madame 
Schoss' 
familiar 
whistling 
snore 
and 
Sonya's 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/iV7QSsE26xhd.html">gentle
breathing.</a> 
Then 
the 
countess 
called 
to 
Natasha. 
Natasha 
did 
not 
answer.

"I 
think 
she's 
asleep, 
Mamma," 
said 
Sonya 
softly.

After 
a 
short 
silence 
the 
countess 
spoke 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/XK5gdRt7tQp3t.html">again</a> 
but 
this 
time 
no 
one
replied.

Soon 
after 
that 
Natasha 
heard 
her 
mother's 
even 
breathing. 
Natasha 
did
not 
move, 
though 
her 
little 
bare 
foot,<p>
thrust 
out 
from 
under 
the 
quilt,
was 
growing 
cold 
on 
the 
bare 
floor.

As 
if 
to 
celebrate 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/YI1suxK18NROku.html">a</a> 
victory 
over 
everybody, 
a 
cricket 
chirped 
in 
a
crack 
in 
the 
wall. 
A 
cock 
crowed 
<a href="/cZl/yY6l5dZEO8hMvng.html">far</a> 
off 
and 
another 
replied 
near
by. 
The 
shouting 
in 
the 
tavern 
had 
died 
down; 
only 
the 
moaning 
of 
the
adjutant 
was 
heard. 
Natasha 
sat 
up.

"Sonya, 
are 
you 
asleep? 
Mamma?" 
she 
whispered.

No 
one 
replied. 
Natasha 
rose 
slowly 
and 
carefully, 
crossed 
herself, 
and
stepped 
cautiously 
on 
the 
cold 
and 
dirty 
floor 
with 
her 
slim, 
supple,
bare 
feet. 
The 
boards 
of 
the 
floor 
creaked. 
Stepping 
cautiously 
from 
one
foot 
to 
the 
other 
she 
ran 
like 
a 
kitten 
the 
few 
steps 
to 
the 
door 
and
grasped 
the 
cold 
door
