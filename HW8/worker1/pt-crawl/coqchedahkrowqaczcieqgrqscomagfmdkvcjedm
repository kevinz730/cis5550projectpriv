room 
even 
more</h1>boldly 
than
that 
afternoon. 
She 
felt 
that 
as 
she 
brought 
with 
her 
the 
person 
the
dying 
man 
wished 
to 
see, 
her 
own 
admission 
was 
assured. 
Casting<p>
a 
rapid
glance 
at 
all 
those 
in 
the 
room 
and 
noticing 
the 
count's 
confessor
there, 
she 
glided 
up 
to 
him 
with 
a 
sort 
of 
amble, 
not 
exactly 
bowing 
yet
seeming 
to 
grow 
suddenly 
smaller, 
and 
<a href="/cZl/lm1AjGP8G4vf.html">respectfully</a> 
received<p>
the 
blessing
first 
of 
one 
and 
then 
of 
another 
priest.

"God 
be 
thanked 
that 
you 
are 
in 
time," 
said 
she 
to 
one 
of 
the
priests; 
"all 
we 
relatives 
have 
been 
in 
such 
anxiety. 
This 
young
man 
is 
the 
count's 
son," 
she 
added 
more 
softly. 
"What 
a 
terrible
moment!"

Having 
said 
this 
she 
went 
up 
to 
the 
doctor.

"Dear 
doctor," 
said 
she, 
"this 
young 
man 
is 
the 
count's 
son. 
Is
there 
any 
hope?"

The 
doctor 
cast 
a 
rapid 
glance 
upwards 
and 
silently 
shrugged 
his
shoulders. 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
with 
just 
the 
same 
movement 
raised 
her
shoulders 
and 
eyes, 
<a href="/aVzUge/PC6XKBx6fnq.html">almost</a> 
closing 
the 
latter, 
sighed, 
and 
moved 
away
from 
the 
doctor 
to 
Pierre. 
To 
him, 
in 
a 
particularly 
respectful 
and
tenderly 
sad 
voice, 
she<p>
said:

"Trust 
in 
His 
mercy!" 
and 
pointing 
out 
a 
small 
sofa 
for 
him 
to 
sit
and 
wait 
for 
her, 
she 
went 
silently 
toward 
the 
door 
that 
everyone 
was
watching 
and 
it 
creaked 
very 
slightly 
as 
she 
disappeared 
behind 
it.

Pierre, 
having 
made 
up 
his 
mind 
to 
obey 
his 
monitress 
implicitly, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NXJ5AHAK.html">moved
toward</a> 
the 
sofa 
she 
had 
indicated. 
As 
soon 
as 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
had
disappeared 
he 
noticed 
that 
the 
eyes 
of 
all 
in 
the 
room 
turned 
to 
him
with 
something 
more 
than 
curiosity 
and 
sympathy. 
He 
noticed 
that 
they
whispered 
to 
one 
another, 
casting 
significant 
looks 
at 
him 
with 
a 
kind
of 
awe 
and 
even 
servility. 
A 
deference 
such 
as 
he 
had 
never 
before
received 
was 
shown 
him. 
A 
strange 
lady, 
the 
one<p>
who<p>
had 
been 
talking 
to
the 
priests, 
rose 
and 
offered 
him 
her 
seat; 
an 
aide-de-camp 
picked 
up
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jbn1GBzwy5Bxal6mAz.html">returned</a> 
a 
glove 
Pierre 
had 
dropped; 
the 
doctors 
became 
respectfully
silent 
as 
he 
passed 
by, 
and 
moved 
to 
make 
way 
for 
him.<p>
At 
first 
Pierre
wished 
to 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ef7fLYk28jEXr.html">take</a> 
another 
seat 
so 
as 
not 
to 
trouble 
the 
lady, 
and 
also 
to
pick 
up 
the 
glove 
himself 
and 
to 
pass 
round 
the 
doctors 
who 
were 
not
even 
in 
his 
way; 
but 
all 
at 
once 
he 
felt 
that 
this 
would 
not 
do, 
and
that 
tonight 
he 
was 
a 
person 
obliged 
to 
perform 
some 
sort 
of 
awful
rite 
which 
everyone 
expected 
of 
him, 
and 
that 
he 
was 
therefore 
bound
to 
accept 
their 
services. 
He 
took 
the 
glove 
in 
silence 
from 
the
aide-de-camp, 
and 
sat 
down 
in
