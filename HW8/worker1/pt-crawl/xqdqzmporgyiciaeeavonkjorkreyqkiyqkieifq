and 
freedom</h1>from 
cares 
so 
beset 
and
preoccupied 
that 
only 
in 
bed 
was 
he 
able 
to 
be 
by 
himself. 
He 
had 
to
sign 
papers, 
to 
present 
himself 
at 
government 
offices, 
the 
purpose 
of
which 
was 
not 
clear 
to 
him, 
to 
question 
his 
chief 
steward, 
to 
visit 
his
estate 
near 
Moscow, 
and 
to 
receive 
many 
people 
who 
formerly 
did 
not
even 
wish 
to 
know 
of 
his 
existence 
but 
would 
now 
have 
been 
offended
and 
grieved 
had 
he 
chosen 
not 
to<p>
see 
them. 
These 
different
people-businessmen, 
relations, 
and 
acquaintances 
alike-were 
all
disposed 
to 
treat 
the 
young 
heir 
in 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Io4dK9Ujvc.html">most</a> 
friendly 
and 
flattering
manner: 
they 
were 
all 
evidently 
firmly 
convinced 
of 
Pierre's 
noble
qualities. 
He 
was 
always 
hearing<p>
such 
words 
as: 
"With 
your 
remarkable
kindness," 
or, 
"With 
your 
excellent 
heart," 
"You 
are 
yourself 
so
honorable, 
Count," 
or, 
"Were 
he 
as 
clever 
as 
you," 
and 
so 
on,
till 
he 
began 
sincerely 
to 
believe 
in 
his 
own 
exceptional 
kindness 
and
extraordinary 
intelligence, 
the 
more 
so 
as 
in 
the 
depth 
of 
his 
heart 
it
had 
always 
seemed 
to 
him 
that 
he 
really 
was 
very 
<a href="/aVzUge/ZUI6tQp05Akk.html">kind</a> 
and 
intelligent.
Even 
people 
who 
had 
formerly 
been 
spiteful 
toward 
him 
and 
evidently
unfriendly 
now 
became 
gentle 
and 
affectionate. 
The 
angry 
eldest
princess, 
with 
the 
long 
waist 
and 
hair 
plastered 
down 
like 
a 
doll's,
had 
come 
<a href="/cZl/AJ1bE33yG.html">into</a> 
Pierre's 
room 
after 
the 
funeral. 
With 
drooping 
eyes
and 
frequent 
blushes 
she 
told 
him 
she 
was 
very 
sorry 
about 
their 
past
misunderstandings 
and 
did 
not 
now 
feel 
she 
had 
a 
right 
to 
ask 
him 
for
anything, 
except 
only 
for 
permission, 
after 
the 
blow 
she 
had 
received,
to 
remain 
for 
a 
few 
weeks 
longer 
in 
the 
house 
she 
so 
loved 
and 
where
she 
had 
sacrificed 
so 
much. 
She 
could 
not 
refrain 
from 
weeping
