The 
generals 
bowed 
and 
retired. 
It 
was 
past
midnight. 
Prince 
Andrew 
went 
out.

The 
council 
of 
war, 
at 
which 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
not 
been 
able 
to
express 
his 
opinion 
as 
he 
had 
hoped 
to, 
left 
on 
him 
a 
vague 
and 
uneasy
impression. 
Whether 
Dolgorukov 
and 
Weyrother, 
or 
Kutuzov, 
Langeron,
and 
the 
others 
who 
did 
not 
approve 
of 
the 
plan 
of 
attack, 
were
right-he 
did 
not 
know. 
"But 
was 
it 
really 
not 
possible 
for 
Kutuzov
to 
state 
his 
views 
plainly 
to 
the 
Emperor? 
Is 
it<p>
possible 
that 
on
account 
of 
court 
and 
personal 
considerations 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
lives,
and 
my 
life, 
my 
life," 
he 
thought, 
"must 
be 
risked?"

"Yes, 
it 
is 
very 
likely 
that 
I 
shall 
be 
killed 
tomorrow," 
he
thought. 
And 
suddenly, 
at 
this 
thought 
of 
death, 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
most
distant, 
most 
intimate, 
memories 
rose 
in 
his 
imagination: 
he 
remembered
his 
last 
parting 
from 
his 
father 
and 
his 
wife; 
he 
remembered 
the 
days
when 
he 
first 
loved 
her. 
He 
thought 
of 
her 
pregnancy 
and 
felt 
sorry 
for
her 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xk9CyE4dcFeE.html">for</a> 
himself, 
and 
in 
a 
nervously 
emotional 
and 
softened 
mood 
he
went 
out 
of 
the 
hut 
in 
which 
he 
was 
billeted 
with 
Nesvitski 
and 
began
to 
walk 
up 
and 
down 
before 
it.

The 
night 
was 
foggy 
and 
through 
the 
fog 
the 
moonlight 
gleamed
mysteriously. 
"Yes, 
tomorrow, 
tomorrow!" 
he 
thought. 
"Tomorrow
everything 
may 
be 
over 
for 
me! 
All 
these 
memories 
will 
be 
no 
more, 
none
of 
them 
will 
have 
any 
meaning 
for 
me. 
Tomorrow 
perhaps, 
even 
certainly,
I 
have 
a 
presentiment 
that 
for 
the 
first 
time 
I 
shall 
have 
to 
show 
all
I 
can 
do." 
And 
his 
fancy 
pictured 
the 
battle, 
its 
loss, 
the
concentration 
of 
fighting 
at 
one 
point, 
and 
the 
hesitation 
of 
all 
the
commanders. 
And 
then 
that 
happy 
moment, 
that 
Toulon 
for 
which 
he 
had
so 
long 
waited, 
presents 
itself 
to 
him 
at 
last. 
He 
firmly 
and 
clearly
expresses 
his 
opinion 
to 
Kutuzov, 
to 
Weyrother, 
and 
to 
the 
Emperors.
All 
are 
struck 
by 
the 
justness 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mRO2tA4xLYdP0.html">his</a> 
views, 
but 
no 
one 
undertakes 
to
carry 
them 
out, 
so 
he 
takes 
a 
regiment, 
a 
division-stipulates 
that 
no
one 
is 
to 
interfere 
with 
his 
arrangements-leads 
his 
division 
to
the 
decisive 
point, 
and 
gains 
the 
victory 
alone. 
"But 
death 
and
suffering?" 
suggested 
another 
voice. 
Prince 
Andrew, 
however, 
did 
not
answer 
that 
voice 
and 
went 
on 
dreaming 
of 
his 
triumphs. 
The 
dispositions
for 
the 
next 
battle 
are 
planned 
by 
him 
alone. 
Nominally 
he 
is 
only 
an
adjutant 
on 
Kutuzov's 
staff, 
but 
he 
does 
everything 
alone. 
The 
next
battle 
is 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Yv7tA1IgdEd9UybKc.html">won</a> 
by 
him 
alone. 
Kutuzov 
is 
removed 
and 
he 
is 
appointed...
"Well 
and 
then?" 
asked 
the 
other 
voice. 
"If 
before 
that 
you 
are
not 
ten 
times 
wounded, 
killed, 
or 
betrayed, 
well... 
what 
then?..."
"Well 
then," 
Prince 
Andrew 
answered 
himself, 
"I 
don't 
know
what 
will 
happen 
and 
don't 
want 
to 
know, 
and 
can't, 
but<p>
if
