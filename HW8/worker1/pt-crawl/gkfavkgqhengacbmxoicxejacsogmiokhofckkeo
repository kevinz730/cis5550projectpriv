a
minimum 
of</h1>free 
will. 
If 
we 
examine 
a 
man 
little 
dependent 
on 
external
conditions, 
whose 
action 
was 
performed 
very 
recently, 
and 
the 
causes 
of
whose 
action 
are 
beyond 
our 
ken, 
we 
get 
the 
conception 
of 
a 
minimum 
of
inevitability 
and 
a 
maximum 
of 
freedom.

In 
neither 
case-however 
we 
may 
change 
our 
point 
of 
view, 
however 
plain
we 
may 
make 
to 
ourselves 
the 
connection 
between 
the 
man<p>
and 
the 
external
world, 
however 
inaccessible 
it 
may 
be 
to 
us, 
however 
long 
or 
<a href="/cZl/MsT32QJprO1.html">short</a> 
the
period 
of 
time,<p>
however 
intelligible<p>
or 
incomprehensible 
the 
causes
of 
the 
action 
may 
be-can 
we 
ever 
conceive 
either 
complete 
freedom 
or
complete 
necessity.

(1) 
To 
whatever 
degree 
we 
may 
imagine 
a 
man 
to 
be 
exempt 
from 
the
influence 
of 
the 
external 
world, 
we 
never 
get 
a 
conception 
of 
freedom
in 
space. 
Every 
human 
action 
is 
inevitably 
conditioned 
by 
what 
surrounds
him 
and 
by 
his 
own 
body. 
I 
lift 
my 
arm 
and 
let 
it 
fall. 
My 
action 
seems
to 
me 
free; 
but 
asking 
myself 
whether 
I 
could 
raise 
my 
arm 
in 
every
direction, 
I 
see 
that 
I 
raised 
it 
in 
the 
direction 
in 
which 
there 
was
least 
obstruction 
to 
that 
action 
either 
from 
things 
around 
me 
or 
from
the 
construction 
of 
my 
own 
body. 
I 
chose<p>
one 
out 
of 
all 
the 
possible
directions 
because 
in 
it 
there<p>
were 
fewest 
obstacles. 
For 
my 
action
to 
be 
free 
it 
was 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
encounter 
no 
obstacles. 
To
conceive 
of 
a 
man 
being 
free 
we 
must 
imagine 
him 
outside 
space, 
which 
is
evidently 
impossible.

(2) 
However 
much 
we 
approximate 
the 
time 
of 
judgment 
to 
the 
time 
of 
the
deed, 
we 
never 
get 
a 
conception 
of 
freedom 
in 
time. 
For 
if 
I 
examine
an 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/SvD30gcnoA5Z.html">action</a> 
committed 
a 
second 
<a href="/aVzUge/hW2bXmQ81KA.html">ago</a> 
I 
must 
still 
recognize 
it 
as 
not
being 
free, 
for 
it 
is 
irrevocably 
linked 
to 
the 
moment 
at 
which 
it 
was
committed. 
Can 
I 
lift 
my 
arm? 
I 
lift 
it, 
but 
ask 
myself: 
could 
I 
have
abstained 
from<p>
lifting 
my 
arm 
at 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xg3s7mGGRm3bvO.html">moment</a> 
that 
has 
already 
passed? 
To
convince 
myself 
of 
this 
I 
do 
not 
lift 
it 
the 
next 
moment. 
But 
I 
am
not 
now 
abstaining 
from 
doing 
so 
at 
the 
first 
moment<p>
when 
I 
asked
