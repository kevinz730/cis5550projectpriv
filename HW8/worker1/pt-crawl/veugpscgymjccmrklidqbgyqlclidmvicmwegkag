occupied 
with 
evening<p>
parties, 
dinners, 
lunches, 
and 
balls, 
giving 
him
no 
time 
for 
reflection, 
as 
in 
Petersburg. 
Instead 
of 
the 
new 
life 
he 
had
hoped 
to 
<a href="/cZl/Wt4epgGc7L4Z.html">lead</a> 
he 
still 
lived 
the 
old 
life, 
only 
in 
new 
surroundings.

Of 
the 
three 
precepts 
of 
Freemasonry 
Pierre 
realized 
that 
he 
did 
not
fulfill 
the 
one 
which 
enjoined 
every 
Mason 
to 
set 
an 
example 
<a href="/aVzUge/oF9CKY7wjGAw5Scb.html">of</a> 
moral
life, 
and 
that 
of 
the 
seven 
virtues 
<a href="/cZl/ONG1G2HQTp9iPl.html">he</a> 
lacked 
two-morality 
and 
the
love 
of 
death. 
He 
consoled 
himself 
with 
the 
thought 
that 
he 
fulfilled
another 
of 
the 
precepts-that 
of 
reforming 
the 
human 
race-and 
had
other 
virtues-love 
of 
his 
neighbor, 
and 
especially 
generosity.

In 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/Uo1Eh4xgX7ZMYAE.html">spring</a> 
of 
1807 
he 
decided 
to 
return 
to 
Petersburg. 
On 
the 
way 
he
intended 
to 
visit 
all 
his 
estates 
and 
see 
for 
himself 
how 
far 
his 
orders
had 
been 
carried 
out 
and 
in 
what 
state 
were 
the 
serfs 
whom 
God 
had
entrusted 
to 
his 
care 
and 
whom 
he 
intended 
to 
benefit.

The 
chief 
steward, 
who 
considered 
the 
young 
count's 
attempts 
almost
insane-unprofitable 
to 
himself, 
to 
the 
count, 
and 
to 
the 
serfs-made
some 
concessions. 
Continuing 
to 
represent 
the<p>
liberation 
of 
the 
serfs
as 
impracticable, 
he 
arranged 
for 
the 
erection 
of 
large
buildings-schools, 
hospitals, 
and 
asylums-on 
all 
the 
estates
before 
the 
master 
arrived. 
Everywhere 
preparations 
were 
made 
not 
for
ceremonious 
welcomes 
(which 
he 
knew 
Pierre 
would 
not 
like), 
but 
for 
just
such 
gratefully 
religious 
ones, 
with 
offerings 
of 
icons 
and 
the 
bread
and 
salt 
of 
hospitality, 
as, 
according 
to 
his 
understanding 
of 
his
master, 
would 
touch 
and 
delude 
him.

The 
southern 
spring, 
the 
comfortable 
rapid 
traveling 
in 
a 
Vienna
carriage, 
and 
the 
solitude 
of 
the 
road, 
all 
had 
a 
gladdening 
effect 
on
Pierre. 
The 
estates 
he 
had 
not 
before 
visited 
were 
each 
more 
picturesque
than 
the 
other; 
the 
serfs 
everywhere 
seemed 
thriving 
and 
touchingly
grateful 
for 
the 
benefits 
conferred 
<a href="/cZl/BP2XQ9XHd4N.html">on</a> 
them. 
Everywhere 
were 
receptions,
which 
though 
they 
embarrassed 
Pierre 
awakened 
a 
joyful 
feeling
