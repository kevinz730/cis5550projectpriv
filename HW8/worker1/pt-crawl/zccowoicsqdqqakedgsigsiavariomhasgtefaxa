human 
voice 
of 
the 
Emperor</h1>saying
with 
emotion:

"I 
never 
doubted 
the 
devotion 
of 
the 
Russian 
nobles, 
but 
today 
it 
has
surpassed 
my 
expectations. 
I 
thank 
you 
in 
the 
name 
of 
<a href="/aVzUge/gAh2wUl6Nz7h.html">the</a> 
Fatherland!
Gentlemen, 
let 
us 
act! 
Time 
is 
most 
precious...."

The 
Emperor 
ceased 
speaking, 
the 
crowd 
began 
pressing 
round 
him, 
and
rapturous 
exclamations 
were 
heard 
from 
all 
sides.

"Yes, 
most 
precious... 
a 
royal 
word," 
said 
Count 
Rostov, 
with 
a 
sob. 
He
stood 
at 
the 
back, 
and, 
though 
he 
had 
heard 
hardly 
anything, 
understood
everything 
in 
his 
own 
way.

From 
the 
hall 
of 
the 
nobility 
the 
Emperor 
went 
to 
that 
of 
the 
merchants.
There 
he 
remained 
about 
ten 
minutes. 
Pierre 
was 
among 
those 
who 
saw 
him
come 
out 
from 
the 
merchants' 
hall 
with 
tears 
of 
emotion 
in 
his 
eyes.
As 
became 
known 
later, 
he 
had 
scarcely 
begun 
to 
address 
the 
merchants
before 
tears 
gushed 
from 
his<p>
eyes 
and 
he 
concluded 
in 
a 
trembling
voice. 
When 
Pierre 
saw 
the 
Emperor 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xa2t8Cv2U.html">he</a> 
was 
coming 
out 
accompanied 
by 
two
merchants, 
one 
of 
whom 
Pierre 
knew, 
a 
fat 
otkupshchik. 
The 
other 
was
the 
mayor, 
a 
man 
with 
a 
thin 
sallow 
face<p>
and 
narrow 
beard. 
Both 
were
weeping. 
Tears 
filled 
the 
thin 
man's 
eyes, 
and 
the 
fat 
otkupshchik
sobbed 
outright 
like 
a 
child 
and 
kept 
repeating:

"Our 
lives 
and 
property-take 
them, 
Your 
Majesty!"

Pierre's 
one 
feeling 
at 
the 
moment 
was 
a 
desire 
to 
show 
that 
he 
was
ready 
to 
go 
all 
lengths 
and 
was 
prepared 
to 
sacrifice 
everything. 
He 
now
felt 
ashamed 
of 
his 
speech 
with 
its 
constitutional 
tendency 
and 
sought
an 
opportunity 
of 
effacing 
it. 
Having 
heard 
that 
Count 
Mamonov 
was
furnishing 
a 
regiment, 
Bezukhov 
at 
once 
informed<p>
Rostopchin 
that 
he
would 
give 
a 
thousand 
men 
and 
their 
maintenance.

Old 
Rostov 
could 
not 
tell 
his 
wife 
of 
what 
had 
passed 
without 
tears, 
and
at 
once 
consented 
to 
Petya's 
request 
and 
went 
himself 
to 
enter 
his 
name.

Next 
day 
the 
Emperor 
left 
Moscow. 
The 
assembled 
nobles 
all 
took 
off
their 
uniforms 
and 
settled 
down 
again 
in 
their 
homes 
and 
clubs, 
and 
not
without 
some 
groans 
gave 
orders 
to 
their 
stewards 
about 
the 
enrollment,
feeling 
amazed 
themselves 
at 
what 
they 
had 
done.





BOOK 
TEN: 
1812





CHAPTER 
I

Napoleon 
began 
the 
war 
with 
Russia 
because 
he 
could 
not 
resist 
going
to 
Dresden, 
could 
not 
help 
having 
his 
head 
turned 
by 
the 
homage 
he
received, 
could 
not 
help 
donning 
a 
Polish 
uniform 
and 
yielding 
to 
the
stimulating 
influence 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/njR9fLYk6NSUp5Url.html">a</a> 
June 
morning, 
and 
could 
not 
refrain 
from
bursts 
of 
anger 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
Kurakin 
and 
then 
of 
Balashev.

Alexander 
refused 
negotiations 
because 
he 
felt 
himself 
to 
be 
personally
insulted. 
Barclay 
de 
Tolly 
tried 
to 
command 
the 
army 
in 
the 
best
way, 
because 
he 
wished 
to 
fulfill 
his 
duty 
and<p>
earn 
fame<p>
as 
a 
great
commander. 
Rostov 
charged 
the 
French 
because 
he 
could 
not 
restrain
his 
wish 
for 
a 
gallop 
across 
a 
level 
field; 
and 
in 
the 
same 
way 
the
innumerable 
people 
who 
took 
part 
in 
the 
war 
acted 
in 
accord 
with 
their
personal 
characteristics, 
habits, 
circumstances, 
and 
aims. 
They 
were
moved 
by 
fear 
or 
vanity, 
rejoiced 
or 
were 
indignant, 
reasoned, 
imagining
that<p>
they 
knew 
what 
they 
were 
doing 
and 
did 
it 
of 
their 
own 
free 
will,
but 
they 
all 
were 
involuntary 
tools 
of 
history, 
carrying 
on 
a 
work
concealed 
from 
them 
but 
comprehensible 
to 
us. 
Such<p>
is 
the 
inevitable
fate 
of 
men 
of 
action, 
and 
the 
higher 
they 
stand 
in 
the 
social 
hierarchy
the 
less 
are 
they 
free.

The 
actors 
of 
1812

stage,
