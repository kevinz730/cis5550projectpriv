servants, 
but 
was 
still 
the 
same 
narrowly
intelligent, 
conscientious, 
and 
pedantic 
preceptor. 
The 
old 
prince
had 
changed 
in 
appearance 
only 
by 
the 
loss 
of 
a 
tooth, 
which 
left 
a
noticeable 
gap<p>
on 
one 
side 
of 
his 
mouth; 
in 
character 
he 
was 
the 
same 
as
ever, 
only 
showing 
still 
more 
irritability 
and 
skepticism 
as 
to 
what 
was
happening 
in 
the 
world. 
Little 
Nicholas 
alone 
had 
changed. 
He 
had 
grown,
become 
rosier, 
had 
curly 
dark 
hair, 
and, 
when 
merry 
and 
laughing, 
quite
unconsciously 
lifted 
the 
upper 
lip 
of 
his 
pretty 
little 
mouth 
just
as 
the 
little 
princess 
used 
to 
do. 
He 
alone 
did 
not 
obey 
the 
law 
of
immutability 
in 
the 
enchanted, 
sleeping 
castle. 
But 
though<p>
externally
all 
remained 
as 
of 
old, 
the 
inner 
relations 
of 
all 
these 
people 
had
changed 
since 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
seen 
them<p>
last. 
The 
household 
was
divided 
into 
two 
alien 
and 
hostile 
camps, 
who 
changed 
their 
habits 
for
his 
sake 
and 
only 
met 
because 
he 
was 
there. 
To 
the 
one 
camp 
belonged
the 
old 
prince, 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
and 
the 
architect; 
to 
the 
other
Princess 
Mary, 
Dessalles, 
little 
Nicholas, 
and 
all 
the 
old 
nurses 
and
maids.

During 
his 
stay 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
all 
the 
family 
dined 
together, 
but 
they
were 
ill 
at 
ease 
and 
Prince 
Andrew 
felt 
that 
he 
was 
a 
visitor 
for 
whose
sake 
an 
exception 
was 
being 
made 
and 
that 
his 
presence 
made 
them 
all
feel 
awkward. 
Involuntarily 
feeling 
this 
at 
dinner 
on 
the 
first 
day, 
he
was 
taciturn, 
and 
the 
old 
prince 
noticing 
this 
also 
became 
morosely 
dumb
and 
retired 
to 
his 
apartments 
directly 
after 
dinner. 
In<p>
the 
evening,
when 
Prince 
Andrew 
went 
to 
him 
and, 
trying 
to 
rouse 
him, 
began 
to
tell 
him 
of 
the 
young 
Count 
Kamensky's 
campaign, 
the 
old 
prince
began 
unexpectedly 
to 
talk 
about 
Princess 
Mary, 
blaming 
her 
for 
her
superstitions 
and 
her 
dislike 
of 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
who, 
he 
said,
was 
the 
only 
person 
really 
attached 
to 
him.

The 
old 
prince 
said 
that 
if 
he 
was 
ill 
it 
was 
only 
because 
of 
Princess
Mary: 
that 
she 
purposely 
worried 
and 
irritated 
him, 
and 
that 
by
indulgence 
and 
silly 
talk 
she
