them 
not 
to 
crowd</h1>together."

The 
adjutant, 
having 
obeyed 
this 
instruction, 
approached 
Prince 
Andrew.
From 
the 
other 
side 
a 
battalion 
commander 
rode 
up.

"Look 
out!" 
came 
a 
frightened 
cry 
from 
a 
soldier 
and, 
like 
a 
bird
whirring 
in 
rapid 
flight 
and 
alighting 
on 
the 
ground, 
a 
shell 
dropped
with 
little 
noise 
within 
two 
steps 
of 
Prince 
Andrew 
and 
close 
to 
the
battalion 
commander's 
horse. 
The 
horse 
first, 
regardless 
of 
whether 
it
was 
right 
or 
wrong 
to 
show 
fear, 
snorted, 
reared 
almost 
throwing 
the
major, 
and 
galloped 
aside. 
The 
horse's 
terror 
infected 
the 
men.

"Lie 
down!" 
cried 
the 
adjutant, 
throwing 
himself 
flat 
on 
the 
ground.

Prince 
Andrew 
hesitated. 
The 
smoking 
shell 
spun 
like 
a 
top 
between 
him
and 
the 
prostrate 
adjutant, 
near 
a 
wormwood 
plant 
between 
the 
field 
and
the 
meadow.

"Can 
this 
be 
death?" 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
looking 
with 
a 
quite 
new,
envious 
glance 
at 
the 
grass, 
the 
wormwood, 
and 
the 
streamlet 
of 
smoke
that 
curled 
up 
from 
the 
rotating 
black 
ball. 
"I 
cannot, 
I 
do 
not 
wish 
to
die. 
I 
love 
life-I 
love 
this 
grass, 
this 
earth, 
this 
air...." 
He 
thought
this, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
remembered 
that 
people 
were 
looking 
at 
him.

"It's 
shameful, 
sir!" 
he 
said 
to 
the 
adjutant. 
"What..."

He 
did 
not 
finish 
speaking. 
At 
one 
and 
the 
same 
moment 
came 
the 
sound 
of
an 
explosion, 
a 
whistle 
of 
splinters 
as 
from 
a 
breaking 
window 
frame,
a 
suffocating 
smell 
of 
powder, 
and 
Prince 
Andrew 
started 
to 
one 
side,
raising 
his 
arm, 
and 
fell 
on 
his 
chest. 
Several 
officers 
ran 
up 
to 
him.
From 
the 
right 
side 
of 
his 
abdomen, 
blood 
was 
welling 
out 
making 
a 
large
stain 
on 
the 
grass.

The 
militiamen 
with 
stretchers 
who 
were 
called 
up 
stood 
behind 
the
officers. 
Prince 
Andrew 
lay 
on 
his<p>
chest 
with 
his 
face 
in 
the 
grass,
breathing 
heavily 
and 
noisily.

"What 
are 
you 
waiting 
for? 
Come 
along!"

The 
peasants 
went 
up 
and 
took 
him 
by 
his 
shoulders 
and 
legs, 
but 
he
moaned 
piteously 
and, 
exchanging 
looks, 
they 
set 
him 
down 
again.

"Pick 
him 
up, 
lift 
him, 
it's 
all 
the 
same!" 
cried 
someone.

They 
again 
took 
him 
by 
the 
shoulders 
and 
laid 
him 
on 
the 
stretcher.

"Ah, 
God! 
My 
God! 
What 
is 
it? 
The 
stomach? 
That 
means 
death! 
My
God!"-voices 
among 
the 
officers 
were 
heard 
saying.

"It 
flew 
a 
hair's 
breadth 
past 
my 
ear," 
said<p>
the 
adjutant.

The 
peasants, 
adjusting 
the 
stretcher 
to 
their 
shoulders, 
started
hurriedly 
along 
the<p>
path 
they 
had 
trodden 
down, 
to 
the 
dressing 
station.

"Keep 
in 
step! 
Ah... 
those 
peasants!" 
shouted 
an 
officer, 
seizing 
by
their 
shoulders 
and 
checking 
the 
peasants, 
who 
were 
walking 
unevenly 
and
jolting 
the 
stretcher.

"Get 
into 
step, 
Fedor... 
I 
say, 
Fedor!" 
said 
the 
foremost 
peasant.

"Now 
that's 
right!" 
said 
the 
one 
behind 
joyfully, 
when 
he 
had 
got 
into
step.

"Your 
excellency! 
Eh, 
Prince!" 
said 
the 
trembling 
voice 
of 
Timokhin, 
who
had 
run 
up 
and 
was 
looking 
down 
on 
the 
stretcher.

Prince 
Andrew 
opened 
his 
eyes 
and 
looked 
up 
at 
the 
speaker 
from 
the
stretcher 
into 
which 
his 
head 
had 
sunk 
deep 
and 
again 
his 
eyelids
drooped.


The 
militiamen

Prince 
Andrew

the
