CHAPTER 
XX

On 
the 
morning 
of 
the 
twenty-fifth 
Pierre 
was 
leaving 
Mozhaysk. 
At 
the
descent 
of 
the 
high 
steep 
hill, 
down 
which 
a 
winding

out 
of 
the
town 
past 
the 
cathedral 
on 
the 
right, 
where 
a 
service 
was 
being 
held 
and
the 
bells 
were 
ringing, 
Pierre 
got 
out 
of 
his 
vehicle 
and 
proceeded 
on
foot.
