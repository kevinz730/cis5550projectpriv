Pierre 
often 
indulged 
in 
<a href="/cZl/KD5oL5uq7hyP.html">reflections</a> 
of<p>
this 
sort, 
nullifying
all 
his 
decisions 
and 
intentions. 
He 
went 
to 
Kuragin's.

Reaching 
the 
large 
house 
near 
the 
Horse 
Guards' 
barracks, 
in 
which
Anatole 
lived, 
Pierre 
entered 
the 
lighted 
porch, 
ascended 
the 
stairs,
and 
went 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rg15uFRs2Qc.html">in</a> 
at 
the 
open 
door. 
There 
was 
no 
one 
in 
the 
anteroom; 
empty
bottles, 
cloaks, 
and 
overshoes 
were 
lying 
about; 
there 
was 
a 
smell 
of
alcohol, 
and 
sounds 
of 
voices 
and 
shouting 
in 
the 
distance.

Cards 
and 
supper 
were 
over, 
but 
the 
visitors 
had 
not 
yet 
dispersed.
Pierre 
threw 
off 
his 
cloak 
and 
entered 
the 
first 
room, 
in 
which 
were 
the
remains 
of 
supper. 
A 
footman, 
thinking 
no 
one 
saw 
him, 
was 
drinking 
on
the 
sly 
what 
was 
left 
in 
the 
glasses. 
<a href="/aVzUge/SO90O9PUEsy.html">From</a> 
the 
third 
room 
came 
sounds 
of
laughter, 
the 
shouting 
of 
familiar 
voices, 
the 
growling 
of 
a 
bear, 
and
general 
commotion. 
Some 
eight 
or 
nine 
young 
men 
were 
crowding 
anxiously
round 
an 
open 
window. 
Three 
others 
were 
romping 
with 
a 
young 
bear, 
one
pulling 
him 
by 
the 
chain 
and 
trying 
to 
set 
him 
at 
the 
others.

"I 
bet 
a 
hundred 
on 
Stevens!" 
shouted 
one.

"Mind, 
no 
holding 
on!" 
cried 
another.

"I 
bet 
on 
Dolokhov!" 
cried 
a 
third. 
"Kuragin, 
you 
part 
our
hands."

"There, 
leave 
Bruin 
alone; 
here's 
a 
bet 
on."

"At 
one 
draught, 
or 
he 
loses!" 
shouted 
a 
fourth.

"Jacob, 
bring 
a 
bottle!" 
shouted 
the 
host, 
a 
tall, 
handsome 
fellow
who<p>
stood 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
group, 
without 
a 
coat, 
and 
with 
his 
fine
linen 
shirt 
unfastened 
in 
front. 
"Wait 
a 
bit, 
you 
fellows.... 
Here 
is
Petya! 
Good 
man!" 
cried 
he, 
addressing 
Pierre.

Another 
voice,

man 
of 
medium 
height

clear 
blue 
eyes,
