scanning 
the 
brilliant 
tiers 
of 
boxes 
opposite. 
A 
sensation 
she 
had 
not
experienced 
for 
a 
long 
time-that 
of 
hundreds 
of 
eyes 
looking 
at
her 
bare 
arms 
and 
neck-suddenly 
affected 
her 
both 
agreeably 
and
disagreeably 
and 
called 
up 
a 
whole 
crowd 
of 
memories, 
desires 
and
emotions 
associated 
with 
that 
feeling.

The 
two 
remarkably 
pretty 
girls, 
Natasha 
and 
Sonya, 
with 
Count 
Rostov
who 
had 
not 
been 
seen 
in 
Moscow 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
attracted 
general
attention. 
Moreover, 
everybody 
knew 
vaguely 
of 
Natasha's 
engagement
to 
Prince 
Andrew, 
and 
knew 
that 
the 
Rostovs 
had 
lived 
in 
the 
country
ever

looked 
with 
curiosity 
at 
a 
fiancee 
who 
was 
making
one 
of 
the 
best 
matches 
in 
Russia.

Natasha's 
looks, 
as 
everyone 
told 
her, 
had 
improved 
in 
the 
country,
and 
that 
evening 
thanks 
to 
her 
agitation 
she 
was 
particularly 
pretty.
She 
struck 
those 
who 
saw 
her 
by 
her 
fullness 
of 
life 
and 
beauty,
combined 
with 
her 
indifference 
to 
everything 
about 
her. 
Her 
black 
eyes
looked 
at 
the 
crowd 
without 
seeking 
anyone, 
and 
her 
delicate 
arm, 
bare
to 
above 
the 
elbow, 
lay 
on 
the 
velvet
