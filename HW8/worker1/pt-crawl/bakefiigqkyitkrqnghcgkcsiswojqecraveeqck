think 
that</h1>I, 
too, 
am 
afraid 
of 
him-and 
in 
fact 
I 
am 
afraid 
of
him," 
he 
thought, 
and 
again 
he 
felt 
something 
terrible 
and 
monstrous
rising 
in 
his 
soul. 
Dolokhov, 
Denisov, 
and 
Rostov 
were 
now 
sitting
opposite 
Pierre 
and 
seemed 
very 
gay. 
Rostov 
was 
talking 
merrily 
to 
his
two 
friends, 
one 
of 
whom 
was 
a 
dashing 
hussar 
and 
the 
other 
a 
notorious
duelist 
and 
rake, 
and 
every 
now 
and 
then 
he 
glanced 
ironically 
at
Pierre, 
whose 
preoccupied, 
absent-minded, 
and 
massive 
figure 
was 
a 
very
noticeable 
one 
at 
the 
dinner. 
Rostov 
looked 
<a href="/cZl/NP2D1vf5ezc.html">inimically</a> 
at 
Pierre,
first 
because 
Pierre 
appeared 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/zD34lOZ0.html">his</a> 
hussar 
eyes 
as 
a 
rich 
civilian, 
the
husband 
of 
a 
beauty, 
and 
in 
a 
word-an 
old 
woman; 
and 
secondly 
because
Pierre 
in 
his 
preoccupation 
and 
absent-mindedness 
had 
not 
recognized
Rostov 
and 
had 
not 
responded 
to 
his 
greeting. 
When 
the 
Emperor's
health 
was 
drunk, 
Pierre, 
lost 
in 
thought, 
did 
not 
rise 
or 
lift 
his
glass.

"What 
are 
you 
about?" 
shouted<p>
Rostov, 
looking 
at 
him 
in 
an 
ecstasy
of 
exasperation. 
"Don't 
you 
hear 
it's 
His 
Majesty 
the 
Emperor's
health?"

Pierre 
sighed, 
rose 
submissively, 
emptied 
his 
glass, 
and, 
waiting 
till
all 
were 
seated 
again, 
turned 
with 
his 
kindly 
smile 
to 
Rostov.

"Why, 
I 
didn't 
recognize 
you!" 
he 
said. 
But 
Rostov 
was 
otherwise
engaged; 
he 
was 
shouting 
"Hurrah!"

"Why 
don't 
you 
renew 
the 
acquaintance?" 
said 
Dolokhov 
to 
Rostov.

"Confound 
him, 
he's 
a 
fool!" 
said 
Rostov.

"One 
should<p>
make 
up 
to 
the 
husbands 
of 
pretty 
women," 
said 
Denisov.

Pierre 
did 
not 
catch 
what 
they 
were 
saying, 
but 
knew 
they 
were 
talking
about 
him. 
He 
reddened 
and 
<a href="/cZl/Xo8fnBp1EPTad8Cr.html">turned</a> 
away.

"Well, 
now 
to 
the 
health 
of 
handsome 
women!" 
said 
Dolokhov, 
and
