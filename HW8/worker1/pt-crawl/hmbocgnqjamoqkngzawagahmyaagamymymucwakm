Kutuzov 
made 
no 
rejoinder 
or 
remark. 
The

submissive, 
expressionless 
look 
with

When 
Kutuzov 
came 
out 
of 
the 
study 
and 
with 
lowered 
head 
<a href="/cZl/uq9lLv1pbE7a.html">was</a> 
crossing

heavy 
waddling 
gait, 
he 
was 
arrested 
by 
someone's
voice 
saying:

"Your 
Serene 
Highness!"

Kutuzov 
raised 
his 
head 
and 
looked 
for 
a 
long 
while 
into 
the 
eyes 
of
Count 
Tolstoy, 
who 
stood 
before 
him 
holding 
a 
silver 
salver 
on 
which 
lay
a 
small 
object. 
Kutuzov 
seemed 
not 
to 
understand 
what 
was 
expected 
of
him.

Suddenly 
he 
seemed 
to 
remember; 
a 
scarcely 
perceptible 
smile 
flashed
across 
his 
puffy 
face, 
and 
bowing 
low 
and 
respectfully 
he 
took 
the
object 
that 
lay 
on 
the 
salver.<p>
It 
was 
the 
Order 
of 
St. 
George 
of 
the
First 
Class.
