speak. 
Pierre 
began</h1>with
self-satisfaction 
and 
enthusiasm,<p>
Natasha 
with 
a 
quiet, 
happy 
smile.
Having 
interrupted 
one 
another 
they 
both 
stopped 
to 
let 
the 
other
continue.

"No. 
What 
did 
you 
say? 
Go 
on, 
go 
on."

"No, 
you 
go 
on, 
I 
was 
talking 
nonsense," 
said 
Natasha.

Pierre 
finished 
what 
he 
had 
begun. 
It 
was 
the 
sequel 
to 
his 
complacent
reflections 
on 
his 
success 
in 
Petersburg. 
At 
that 
moment 
it 
seemed 
to
him 
that 
he 
was 
chosen 
to 
give 
a 
new 
direction 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
Russian
society 
and 
to 
the 
whole 
world.

"I 
only 
wished 
to 
say 
that 
ideas 
that 
have 
great 
results 
are 
always
simple 
ones. 
My 
whole 
idea 
is 
that 
if 
vicious 
people 
are 
united 
and
constitute 
a 
power, 
then 
honest 
folk 
must 
do 
the 
same. 
Now 
that's 
simple
enough."

"Yes."

"And 
what 
were 
you 
going 
to 
say?"

"I? 
Only 
nonsense."

"But 
all 
the 
same?"

"Oh 
nothing, 
only 
a 
trifle," 
said 
Natasha, 
smiling 
still 
more 
brightly.
"I 
only 
wanted 
to 
tell 
you 
about 
Petya: 
today 
nurse 
was 
coming 
to 
take
him 
from 
me, 
and 
he 
laughed, 
shut 
his 
eyes, 
and 
clung 
to 
me. 
I'm 
sure
he 
thought 
he 
was 
hiding. 
Awfully<p>
sweet! 
There, 
now 
he's 
crying. 
Well,
good-by!" 
and 
she<p>
left 
the 
room.


Meanwhile 
downstairs 
in 
young 
Nicholas 
Bolkonski's 
bedroom 
a 
little 
lamp
was 
burning 
as 
usual. 
(The 
boy 
was 
afraid 
of 
the 
dark 
and 
they 
could
not 
cure 
him 
of 
it.) 
Dessalles 
slept 
propped 
up 
on 
four 
pillows 
and 
his
Roman 
nose 
emitted 
sounds 
of 
rhythmic 
snoring. 
Little 
Nicholas, 
who 
had
just 
waked 
up 
in 
a<p>
cold 
perspiration, 
sat 
up 
in 
bed 
and 
gazed 
before 
him
with 
wide-open 
eyes. 
He 
had 
awaked 
from 
a 
terrible 
dream. 
He 
had 
dreamed
that 
he 
and 
Uncle 
Pierre, 
wearing 
helmets 
such 
as 
were 
depicted 
in
his 
Plutarch, 
were 
leading 
a 
huge 
army. 
The 
army 
was 
made 
up 
of 
white
slanting 
lines 
that 
filled 
the 
air 
like 
the 
cobwebs 
that 
float 
about 
in
autumn 
and 
which 
Dessalles 
called 
les 
fils 
de 
la 
Vierge. 
In 
front 
was
Glory, 
which 
was 
similar 
to 
those 
threads 
but 
rather 
thicker. 
He 
and
Pierre 
were 
borne 
along 
lightly 
and 
joyously, 
nearer 
and 
nearer 
to 
their
goal. 
Suddenly 
the 
threads 
that 
moved 
them 
began 
to 
slacken 
and 
become
entangled 
and 
it 
grew 
difficult 
to 
move. 
And 
Uncle 
Nicholas 
stood 
before
them 
in 
a 
stern 
and 
threatening 
attitude.

"Have 
you 
done 
this?" 
he 
said, 
pointing 
to 
some 
broken 
sealing 
wax 
and
pens. 
"I 
loved 
you, 
but 
I 
have 
orders 
from 
Arakcheev 
and 
will 
kill
the 
first 
of 
you 
who 
moves 
forward." 
Little 
Nicholas 
turned 
to 
look
at 
Pierre 
but 
Pierre 
was 
no 
longer 
there. 
In 
his 
place 
was 
his
father-Prince 
Andrew-and 
his 
father 
had 
neither 
shape 
nor 
form, 
but 
he
existed, 
and 
when 
little 
Nicholas 
perceived 
him 
he 
grew<p>
faint 
with 
love:
he 
felt 
himself 
powerless, 
limp, 
and 
formless. 
His 
father 
caressed 
and
pitied 
him. 
But 
Uncle 
Nicholas 
came 
nearer 
and 
nearer 
to 
them. 
Terror
seized 
young 
Nicholas 
and 
he 
awoke.

"My 
father!" 
he 
thought. 
(Though 
there 
were 
two 
good 
portraits 
of 
Prince
Andrew 
in 
the 
house, 
Nicholas 
never 
imagined 
him 
in 
human 
form.) 
"My
father 
has 
been 
with 
me 
and 
caressed 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NI5dBoY8m.html">me.</a> 
He 
approved 
of 
me 
and 
of 
Uncle
Pierre. 
Whatever 
he 
may 
tell 
me, 
I 
will 
do 
it. 
Mucius 
Scaevola 
burned
his 
hand. 
Why 
should 
not 
the 
same 
sort 
of 
thing 
happen 
to 
me? 
I 
know
they 
want 
me 
to 
learn. 
And 
I 
will 
learn. 
But 
someday 
I 
shall 
have
finished 
learning, 
and 
then 
I 
will 
do 
something. 
I 
only 
pray 
God 
that
something 
may 
happen 
to 
me 
such 
as 
happened 
to 
Plutarch's 
men, 
and 
I
will 
act 
as 
they 
did. 
I 
will 
do 
better. 
Everyone 
shall 
know 
me, 
love 
me,
and 
be 
delighted 
with 
me!" 
And 
suddenly 
his 
bosom 
heaved 
with 
sobs 
and
he 
began 
to 
cry.

"Are 
you 
ill?" 
he 
heard 
Dessalles' 
voice 
asking.

"No," 
answered 
Nicholas, 
and 
lay 
back 
on 
his 
pillow.

"He 
is 
good 
and 
kind 
and 
I 
am 
fond 
of 
him!" 
he 
thought 
of 
Dessalles.
"But 
Uncle 
Pierre! 
Oh, 
what 
a 
wonderful 
man 
he 
is! 
And 
my 
father? 
Oh,
Father, 
Father! 
Yes, 
I 
will 
do 
something 
with 
which 
even 
he 
would 
be
satisfied...."
