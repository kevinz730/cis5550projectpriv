and 
corn 
as 
of 
his 
own, 
and 
few 
landowners 
had 
their 
crops 
sown
and 
harvested 
so 
early 
and 
so 
well, 
or 
got 
so 
good 
a 
return, 
as 
did
Nicholas.

He 
disliked 
having 
anything 
to 
do 
with 
the 
domestic 
serfs-the 
"drones"
as 
he 
called 
them-and 
everyone 
said 
he 
spoiled 
them 
by 
his 
laxity. 
When
a 
decision 
had 
to 
be 
taken 
regarding 
a 
domestic 
serf, 
especially 
if 
one
had 
to 
be 
punished, 
he 
always<p>
felt 
undecided 
and 
consulted 
everybody 
in
the 
house; 
but 
when 
it 
was 
possible 
to 
have 
a 
domestic 
serf 
conscripted
instead 
of 
a 
land 
worker 
he 
did 
so 
without 
the 
least 
hesitation. 
He
never 
felt 
any 
hesitation 
in 
dealing 
with 
the 
peasants. 
He 
knew 
that 
his
every 
decision 
would 
be 
approved 
by 
them 
all 
with 
very 
few 
exceptions.

He 
did 
not 
allow 
himself 
either 
to 
be<p>
hard 
on 
or 
punish 
a 
man, 
or 
to
make 
things 
easy 
for 
or 
reward 
anyone, 
merely 
because 
he 
felt 
inclined
to 
do 
so. 
He 
could 
not 
have 
said 
by 
what 
standard 
he 
judged 
what 
he
should 
or 
should 
<a href="/aVzUge/NRO377NPl.html">not</a> 
do, 
but 
the 
standard 
was 
quite 
firm 
and 
definite 
in
his 
own 
mind.

Often, 
speaking 
with 
vexation 
of 
some<p>
failure 
or 
irregularity, 
he 
would
say: 
"What 
can 
one 
do 
with 
our 
Russian 
peasants?" 
and 
imagined 
that 
he
could 
not 
bear 
them.

Yet 
he 
loved 
"our 
Russian 
peasants" 
and 
their 
way 
of 
life 
with 
his 
whole
soul, 
and 
for<p>
that 
very 
reason 
had 
understood 
and 
assimilated 
the 
one
way 
and 
manner 
of 
farming 
which 
produced 
good 
results.

Countess 
Mary 
was

of 
this 
passion
