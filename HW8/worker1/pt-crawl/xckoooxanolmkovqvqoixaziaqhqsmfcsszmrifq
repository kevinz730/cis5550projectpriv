the 
Pavlograd 
regiment, 
in 
which
he 
already 
commanded 
the 
squadron 
he 
had 
taken 
over 
from 
Denisov.

Rostov 
had 
become 
a 
bluff, 
good-natured 
fellow, 
whom 
his 
Moscow
acquaintances 
would 
have 
considered 
rather 
bad 
form, 
but 
who 
was 
liked
and 
respected 
by 
his 
comrades, 
subordinates, 
and 
superiors, 
and 
was 
well
contented 
with 
his 
life. 
Of 
late, 
in 
1809, 
he 
found 
in 
letters 
from 
home
more 
frequent 
complaints 
from 
his 
mother 
that 
their 
affairs 
were 
falling
into 
greater 
and 
greater 
disorder, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
time 
for 
him 
to 
come
back 
to 
gladden 
and 
comfort 
his 
old 
parents.

Reading 
these 
letters, 
Nicholas 
felt 
a 
dread 
of 
their 
wanting 
to
take 
him 
away 
from 
surroundings 
in 
which, 
protected 
from 
all<p>
the
entanglements 
of 
life, 
he 
was 
living 
so 
calmly 
and 
quietly. 
He 
felt 
that
sooner 
or 
later 
he 
would 
have 
to 
re-enter 
that 
whirlpool 
of 
life, 
with
its 
embarrassments 
and 
affairs 
to 
be 
straightened 
out, 
its 
accounts
with 
stewards, 
quarrels, 
and 
intrigues, 
its 
ties, 
society, 
and 
with
Sonya's 
love 
and 
his 
promise 
to 
her. 
It 
was 
all 
dreadfully 
difficult
and 
complicated; 
and 
he 
replied 
to 
his 
mother 
in 
cold, 
formal 
letters
in 
French, 
beginning: 
"My 
dear 
Mamma," 
and 
ending: 
"Your 
obedient
son," 
which 
said 
nothing 
of 
when 
he 
would 
return. 
In 
1810 
he 
received
letters 
from 
his 
parents, 
in 
which 
they 
told<p>
him 
of 
Natasha's
engagement 
to 
Bolkonski, 
and 
that 
the 
wedding 
would 
be 
in 
a 
year's
time 
because 
the 
old 
prince 
made 
difficulties. 
This 
letter 
grieved 
and
mortified 
Nicholas. 
In 
the 
first 
place 
he 
was 
sorry 
that 
Natasha, 
for
whom 
he 
cared 
more 
than 
for 
anyone 
else 
in 
the 
family, 
should 
be 
lost 
to
the 
home; 
and 
secondly, 
from 
his 
hussar 
point 
of 
view, 
he 
regretted 
not
to 
have 
been 
there 
to 
show 
that 
fellow 
Bolkonski 
that 
connection 
with
him 
was 
no 
such 
great 
honor 
after 
all, 
and 
that 
if 
he 
loved 
Natasha 
he
might 
dispense 
with 
permission 
from 
his 
dotard 
father. 
For 
a 
moment 
he
hesitated 
whether 
he 
should 
not 
apply 
for 
leave 
in 
order 
to 
see 
Natasha
before 
she 
was 
married, 
but 
then 
came 
the 
maneuvers, 
and 
considerations
about 
Sonya 
and 
about 
the 
confusion 
of 
their 
affairs, 
and 
Nicholas
again 
put 
it 
off. 
But 
in 
the<p>
spring 
of 
that 
year, 
he 
received 
a 
letter
from 
his 
mother, 
written 
without 
his 
father's 
knowledge, 
and 
that
letter 
persuaded 
him 
to 
return. 
She 
wrote 
that 
if 
he 
did 
not 
come 
and
take 
matters 
in 
hand,
