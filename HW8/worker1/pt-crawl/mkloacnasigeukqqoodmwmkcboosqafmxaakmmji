CHAPTER 
III

The 
Russian 
army<p>
was 
commanded 
by 
Kutuzov 
and 
his 
staff, 
and 
also 
by 
the
Emperor 
from 
Petersburg. 
Before 
the 
news 
of 
the 
abandonment 
of 
Moscow
had 
been 
received 
in 
Petersburg, 
a 
detailed 
plan 
of 
the 
whole 
campaign
had 
been 
drawn 
up 
and 
sent<p>
to 
Kutuzov 
for 
his 
guidance. 
Though 
this 
plan
had 
been 
drawn 
up 
on 
the 
supposition 
that 
Moscow 
was 
still 
in 
our 
hands,
it 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/YE3m8rP8GH.html">staff</a><p>
and 
accepted 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
action.
Kutuzov 
only 
replied 
that 
movements 
arranged 
from 
a 
distance 
were 
always
difficult 
to 
execute. 
So 
fresh 
instructions 
were 
sent 
for 
the 
solution
of 
difficulties 
that 
might 
be 
encountered, 
as 
well 
as 
fresh 
people 
who
were 
to 
watch 
Kutuzov's 
actions 
and 
report 
upon 
them.

Besides 
this, 
the 
whole 
staff 
of 
the 
Russian 
army 
was 
now 
reorganized.
The 
posts 
left 
vacant 
by 
Bagration, 
who 
had 
been 
killed, 
and 
by
Barclay, 
who 
had 
gone 
away 
in 
dudgeon, 
had 
to 
be 
filled. 
Very 
serious
consideration 
was 
given 
to 
the 
question 
whether 
it 
would 
be 
better 
to
put 
A 
in 
B's 
place 
and 
B 
in 
D's, 
or 
on 
the 
contrary 
to 
put 
D 
in 
A's
place, 
and 
so 
on-as 
if 
anything 
more 
<a href="/cZl/lx79pDix5pbE.html">than</a> 
A's 
or 
B's 
satisfaction
depended 
on 
this.

As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
hostility 
between 
Kutuzov 
and 
Bennigsen, 
his 
Chief 
of
Staff, 
the 
presence 
of 
confidential 
representatives 
of 
the 
Emperor, 
and
these 
transfers, 
a 
more 
than 
usually 
complicated 
play 
of 
parties
was 
going 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ew6HAJD7Nqwe1.html">on</a> 
among 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
army.<p>
A 
was 
undermining 
B, 
D 
was
undermining 
C, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Br2GaVr7Ta0.html">and</a> 
so 
on 
in 
all 
possible 
combinations 
and 
permutations.
In 
all 
these 
plottings 
the 
subject 
of 
intrigue 
was 
generally 
the 
conduct
of 
the 
war, 
which 
all 
these 
men 
believed 
they 
were 
directing; 
but 
this
affair 
of 
the 
war 
went 
on 
independently 
of 
them, 
as 
it 
had 
to 
go:
that 
is, 
never 
in 
the 
way 
people 
devised, 
but 
flowing 
always 
from 
the
essential 
attitude 
of 
the 
masses. 
Only 
in 
the 
highest 
spheres 
did
all 
these 
schemes, 
crossings, 
and 
interminglings 
appear 
to 
be 
a 
true
reflection 
of 
what 
had 
to 
happen.
