The 
boy,</h1>thrusting 
his 
cold 
hands 
into 
his 
pockets 
and
lifting 
his 
eyebrows, 
looked 
at 
Denisov 
in 
affright, 
but 
in 
spite 
of
an 
evident 
desire 
to 
say 
all 
he 
knew 
gave 
confused 
answers, 
merely
assenting 
to 
everything 
Denisov 
asked 
him. 
Denisov 
turned 
away 
from 
him
frowning 
and 
addressed 
the 
esaul, 
conveying 
his 
own 
conjectures 
to 
him.

Petya, 
rapidly 
turning 
his 
head, 
looked 
now 
at 
the 
drummer 
boy, 
now
at 
Denisov, 
now 
at 
the 
esaul, 
and 
now 
at 
the 
French 
in 
the 
village 
and
along 
the 
road, 
trying 
not 
to 
miss 
anything 
of 
importance.

"Whether 
Dolokhov 
comes 
or 
not, 
we 
must 
seize 
it, 
eh?" 
said 
Denisov 
with
a 
merry 
sparkle 
in 
his 
eyes.

"It 
is 
a 
very 
suitable 
spot," 
said 
the 
esaul.

"We'll 
send 
the 
infantwy 
down 
by 
the 
swamps," 
Denisov 
continued.
"They'll 
cweep 
up 
to 
the 
garden; 
you'll 
wide 
up 
fwom 
there 
with 
the
Cossacks"-he 
pointed 
to 
a 
spot 
in 
the 
forest 
beyond 
the 
village-"and 
I
with 
my 
hussars 
fwom 
here. 
And 
at 
the 
signal 
shot..."

"The 
hollow 
is 
impassable-there's 
a 
swamp 
there," 
said 
the 
esaul. 
"The
horses 
would 
sink. 
We 
must 
ride 
round 
more 
to 
the 
left...."

While 
they 
were 
talking 
in 
undertones 
the 
crack 
<a href="/aVzUge/dq4z4w2.html">of</a> 
a 
shot 
sounded
from 
the 
low 
ground 
by 
the 
pond, 
a 
puff 
of 
white 
smoke 
appeared, 
then
another, 
and 
the 
sound 
of 
hundreds 
of 
seemingly 
merry 
French 
voices
shouting 
together 
came 
up 
from 
the 
slope. 
For 
a 
moment 
Denisov 
and 
the
esaul 
drew 
back. 
They 
were 
so 
near 
that 
they 
thought 
they 
were 
the 
cause
of 
the 
firing 
and 
shouting. 
But 
the 
firing 
and 
shouting 
did 
not 
relate
to 
them.
