an 
expression 
of
pleasure 
on 
his 
face 
approached 
Countess 
Rostova.

"Allow 
me 
to 
introduce 
you 
to 
my 
daughter," 
said 
the 
countess, 
with
heightened 
color.

"I 
have 
the 
pleasure 
of 
being 
already 
acquainted, 
if 
the 
countess
remembers 
me," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
<a href="/cZl/HnB6Ikp4pWxqu4Ujvc.html">a</a> 
low 
and 
courteous 
bow 
quite
belying 
Peronskaya's 
remarks 
about 
his 
rudeness, 
and 
approaching
Natasha 
he 
held 
out 
his 
arm 
to 
grasp 
her 
waist 
before 
he 
had 
completed
his 
invitation. 
He 
asked 
her 
to 
waltz. 
That 
tremulous 
expression 
on
Natasha's 
face, 
prepared 
either 
for 
despair 
or 
rapture, 
suddenly
brightened 
into 
a 
happy, 
grateful, 
childlike 
smile.

"I 
have 
long 
been 
waiting 
for 
you," 
that 
frightened 
happy 
little
girl 
<a href="/cZl/ha5AzQCY6m9KtaDS.html">seemed</a> 
to 
say 
by 
the 
smile 
that 
replaced 
the 
threatened 
tears, 
as
she 
raised 
her 
hand 
to 
Prince 
Andrew's 
shoulder. 
They 
were 
the 
second
couple 
to 
enter 
the 
circle. 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
one 
of 
the 
best 
dancers 
of
his 
day 
and 
Natasha 
danced 
exquisitely. 
Her 
little 
feet 
in 
their 
white
satin 
dancing 
shoes 
did 
their 
work 
swiftly, 
lightly, 
and 
independently
of 
herself, 
while 
her 
face 
beamed 
with 
ecstatic 
happiness. 
Her 
slender
bare 
arms 
and 
neck 
were 
not 
beautiful-compared 
to 
Helene's 
her
shoulders 
looked 
thin 
and 
her 
bosom 
undeveloped. 
But 
Helene 
seemed, 
as
it 
were, 
hardened 
by 
a 
varnish 
left 
by 
the 
thousands 
of 
looks 
that 
had
scanned 
her 
person, 
while 
Natasha 
was 
like 
a 
girl 
exposed 
for 
the<p>
first
time, 
who 
would 
have 
felt 
very 
much 
ashamed 
had 
she 
not 
been 
assured
that 
this 
was 
absolutely 
necessary.

Prince 
Andrew 
liked 
dancing, 
and 
wishing 
to 
escape 
as 
quickly 
as
possible 
from 
the 
political 
and 
clever 
talk 
which 
everyone 
addressed
to 
him, 
wishing 
also 
to 
break 
up 
the 
circle 
of 
restraint 
he 
disliked,
caused 
by 
the 
Emperor's 
presence, 
he 
danced, 
and 
had 
chosen 
Natasha
because 
Pierre 
pointed 
her 
out 
to 
him 
and 
because 
she 
was 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/mbm6iCtOt1bvO1.html">first
pretty</a> 
girl 
who 
caught 
his 
eye; 
but 
scarcely 
had 
he 
embraced 
that
slender 
supple 
figure 
and 
felt 
her 
stirring 
so 
close 
to 
him 
and 
smiling
so 
near 
him 
than 
the 
wine 
of 
her 
charm 
rose 
to 
his 
head, 
and 
he
felt 
himself 
revived 
and 
rejuvenated 
when 
after 
leaving 
her 
he 
stood
breathing 
deeply 
and 
watching 
the 
other 
dancers.





CHAPTER 
XVII

After 
Prince 
Andrew, 
Boris 
came 
up 
to 
ask 
Natasha 
for 
a 
dance, 
and
then 
the 
aide-de-camp 
who 
had 
opened 
the 
ball, 
and 
several 
other 
young
men, 
so 
that, 
flushed 
and 
happy, 
and 
passing<p>
on 
her 
superfluous 
partners
to 
Sonya, 
she 
did 
not 
cease 
dancing 
all 
the 
evening. 
She 
noticed 
and
saw 
nothing 
of 
what 
occupied 
everyone 
else. 
Not 
only 
did 
she 
fail 
to
notice 
that 
the 
Emperor 
talked 
a 
long<p>
time 
with 
the 
French 
ambassador,
and 
how 
particularly 
gracious 
he 
was 
to 
a 
certain 
lady, 
or 
that 
Prince
So-and-so 
and 
So-and-so 
did 
and 
said 
this 
and 
that, 
and 
that 
Helene
had 
great 
success 
and 
was 
honored
