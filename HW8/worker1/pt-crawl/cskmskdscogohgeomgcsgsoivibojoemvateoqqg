In 
Petersburg,</h1>as 
in 
Moscow, 
Pierre 
found 
the 
same 
atmosphere 
of
gentleness 
and 
affection. 
He 
could 
not 
refuse 
the 
post, 
or 
rather 
the
rank 
(for 
he 
did 
nothing), 
that 
Prince 
Vasili 
had 
procured 
for 
him,
and 
acquaintances, 
invitations, 
and 
social 
occupations 
were 
so 
numerous
that, 
even 
more 
than 
in 
Moscow, 
he 
felt 
a 
sense 
of 
bewilderment, 
bustle,
and 
continual 
expectation 
of 
some 
good, 
always 
in 
front 
of 
him 
but 
never
attained.

Of 
his 
former 
bachelor 
acquaintances 
many 
were 
no 
longer 
in 
Petersburg.
The 
Guards 
had 
gone 
to 
the 
front; 
Dolokhov 
had 
been 
reduced 
to 
the
ranks; 
Anatole 
was 
in 
the 
army 
somewhere 
in 
the 
provinces; 
Prince 
Andrew
was 
abroad; 
so 
Pierre 
had 
not 
the 
opportunity 
to 
spend 
his 
nights 
as 
he
used 
to 
like 
to 
spend 
them, 
or 
to 
open 
his 
mind 
by 
intimate 
talks 
with
a 
friend 
older 
than 
himself 
and 
whom 
he 
respected. 
His 
whole 
time
was 
taken 
up 
with 
dinners 
and 
balls 
and 
was 
spent 
chiefly 
at 
Prince
Vasili's 
house 
in 
the 
company 
of 
the 
stout 
princess, 
his 
wife, 
and
his 
beautiful 
daughter 
Helene.

Like 
the 
others, 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
Scherer 
showed 
Pierre 
the 
change 
of
attitude 
toward 
him 
that 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
society.

Formerly 
in 
Anna 
Pavlovna's 
presence, 
Pierre 
had 
always 
felt 
that
what 
he<p>
was 
saying 
was 
out 
of 
place, 
tactless 
and 
unsuitable, 
that
remarks 
which 
seemed 
to 
him 
clever 
while 
they 
formed 
in 
his 
mind 
became
foolish 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
uttered 
them, 
while 
on 
the 
contrary 
Hippolyte's
stupidest 
remarks 
came 
out 
clever 
and 
apt. 
Now 
everything 
Pierre 
said
was 
charmant. 
Even 
if 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
did 
not 
say 
so, 
he 
could 
see 
that
she 
wished 
to 
and 
only 
refrained 
out 
of 
regard 
for 
his 
modesty.

In 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
winter 
of 
1805-6 
Pierre 
received 
one 
of 
Anna
Pavlovna's 
usual 
pink 
notes 
with 
<a href="/aVzUge/ZUI6tQp05Akk.html">an</a> 
invitation 
to 
which 
was 
added:
"You 
will 
find 
the 
beautiful 
Helene 
here, 
whom 
it 
is 
always
delightful 
to 
see."

When 
he 
read 
that 
sentence, 
Pierre 
felt 
for 
the 
first 
time 
that 
some
link 
which 
other 
people 
recognized 
had 
grown 
up 
between 
himself 
and
Helene, 
and 
that 
thought 
both 
alarmed 
him, 
as 
if 
some 
obligation 
were
being 
imposed 
on 
him 
which 
he 
could 
not 
fulfill, 
and 
pleased 
him 
as 
an
entertaining 
supposition.

Anna 
Pavlovna's 
"At 
Home" 
was 
like 
the 
former 
one, 
only 
the
novelty 
she 
offered 
her 
guests 
this 
time 
was 
not 
Mortemart, 
but 
a
diplomatist 
fresh 
from 
Berlin 
with 
the 
very 
latest 
details 
of 
the
Emperor 
Alexander's 
visit 
to 
Potsdam, 
and 
of 
how 
the 
two 
august
friends 
had 
pledged 
themselves 
in 
an 
indissoluble<p>
alliance 
to 
uphold
the 
cause 
of 
justice 
against 
the 
enemy 
of 
the 
human 
race.
