fact 
that 
the 
Russian 
commanders-not 
having 
fully
realized 
what 
had 
happened, 
namely 
the 
loss 
of 
our 
position 
on 
the 
left
flank 
and 
the 
shifting 
of 
the 
whole 
field 
of 
the 
forthcoming 
battle 
from
right 
to 
<a href="/cZl/CB8WVP1GiG3.html">left-maintained</a> 
their 
extended 
position 
from 
the 
village 
of
Novoe 
to 
Utitsa, 
and 
consequently 
had 
to 
move 
their 
forces 
from 
right 
to
left 
during 
the 
battle. 
So 
it 
happened 
that 
throughout 
the 
whole 
battle
the 
Russians 
opposed 
the 
entire 
French 
army 
launched 
against 
our 
left
flank 
with 
but 
half 
as 
many 
men. 
(Poniatowski's 
action 
against 
Utitsa,
and 
Uvarov's 
on 
the 
right 
flank 
against 
the 
French, 
were 
actions
distinct 
from 
the 
main 
course 
of 
the 
battle.) 
So 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino
did 
not 
take 
place 
at 
all 
as 
(in 
an 
effort 
to 
conceal 
our 
commanders'
mistakes 
even 
at 
the 
cost 
of<p>
diminishing 
the 
glory 
due 
to 
the 
Russian
army 
and 
people) 
it 
has<p>
been 
described. 
The 
battle 
of 
Borodino 
was 
not
fought 
on 
a 
chosen 
and 
entrenched 
position 
with 
forces 
only 
slightly
weaker 
than 
those 
of 
the 
enemy, 
but, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
loss 
of 
the
Shevardino 
Redoubt, 
the 
Russians 
fought 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino 
on 
an
open 
and 
almost 
unentrenched 
position, 
with 
forces 
only 
half 
as 
numerous
as 
the 
French; 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
under 
conditions 
in 
which 
it 
was 
not
merely 
unthinkable 
to 
fight 
for 
ten 
hours 
and 
secure 
an 
indecisive
result, 
but 
unthinkable 
to 
keep 
an 
army 
even 
from 
complete
disintegration 
and
