She 
spoke 
in 
a 
soft,
tremulous 
voice,<p>
and 
in 
the 
weary 
eyes 
that 
looked 
over 
her 
spectacles
Sonya 
read 
all 
that 
the 
countess 
meant 
to 
convey 
with 
these 
words. 
Those
eyes 
expressed 
entreaty, 
shame 
at 
having 
to 
ask, 
fear 
of 
a 
refusal, 
and
readiness 
for 
relentless 
hatred 
in 
case 
of 
such 
refusal.

Sonya 
went 
up 
to 
the 
countess 
and, 
kneeling 
down, 
kissed 
her 
hand.

"Yes, 
Mamma, 
I 
will 
write," 
said 
she.

Sonya 
was 
softened, 
excited, 
and 
touched 
by 
all 
that 
had 
occurred 
that
day, 
especially 
by 
the 
mysterious 
fulfillment 
she 
had 
just 
seen 
of 
her
vision. 
Now 
that 
she 
knew 
that 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vu9bE2KA0AjGP.html">the</a> 
renewal 
of 
Natasha's 
relations 
with
Prince 
Andrew 
would 
prevent 
Nicholas 
from 
marrying 
Princess 
Mary, 
she
was 
joyfully 
conscious 
of 
a 
return 
of 
that 
self-sacrificing 
spirit 
in
which 
she 
was 
accustomed 
to 
live 
and 
loved 
to 
live. 
So 
with 
a 
joyful
consciousness 
of 
performing 
a 
magnanimous 
deed-interrupted 
several 
times
by 
the 
tears 
that 
dimmed 
her 
velvety 
black 
eyes-she 
wrote 
that 
touching
letter 
the 
arrival 
of 
which 
had 
so 
amazed 
Nicholas.





CHAPTER 
IX

The 
officer 
and 
soldiers 
who 
had 
arrested 
Pierre 
treated 
him 
with
hostility 
but 
yet 
with 
respect, 
<a href="/cZl/Ga6ws1ogilO4rhMF.html">in</a> 
the 
guardhouse 
to 
which 
he 
was 
taken.
In 
their 
attitude 
toward 
him 
could 
still 
be 
felt 
both 
uncertainty 
as
to 
who 
he 
might 
be-perhaps 
a 
very 
important 
person-and 
hostility 
as 
a
result 
of 
their 
recent 
personal 
conflict 
with 
him.

But 
when 
the 
guard 
<a href="/aVzUge/vV5z2XHd9BwgT.html">was</a> 
relieved 
next 
morning, 
Pierre 
felt 
that 
for 
the
new 
guard-both 
officers 
and 
men-he 
was 
not 
as 
interesting 
as 
he 
had
been 
to 
his 
captors; 
and 
in 
fact 
the 
guard 
of 
the 
second 
<a href="/aVzUge/lX3eplAZ1Im2mGGRm.html">day</a> 
did 
not
recognize 
in 
this 
big, 
stout 
man 
in 
a 
peasant 
coat 
the 
vigorous 
person
who 
had 
fought 
so 
desperately 
with 
the 
marauder 
and 
the 
convoy 
and 
had
uttered 
those 
solemn 
words 
about 
saving 
a 
child; 
they 
saw 
in 
him 
only
No.

of 
the 
captured 
Russians, 
arrested 
and 
detained 
for 
some 
reason
by 
order 
of 
the 
Higher 
Command. 
If 
they 
noticed 
anything 
remarkable
about 
Pierre, 
it 
was 
only 
his 
unabashed, 
meditative 
concentration
and 
thoughtfulness, 
and 
the 
way 
he 
spoke 
French, 
which 
struck 
them 
as
surprisingly 
good. 
In 
spite 
of 
this 
he 
was 
placed 
that 
day
