incomprehensible 
the 
causes
of</h1>the 
action 
may 
be-can 
we 
ever 
conceive 
either 
complete 
freedom 
or
complete 
necessity.

(1) 
To 
whatever 
degree 
we 
may 
imagine 
a 
man 
to 
be 
exempt 
from 
the
influence<p>
of 
the 
external 
world, 
we 
never 
get 
a 
conception 
of 
freedom
in 
space. 
Every 
human 
action 
is 
inevitably 
conditioned 
by 
what<p>
surrounds
him 
and 
by 
his 
own 
body. 
I 
lift 
my 
arm 
and 
let 
it 
fall. 
My 
action 
seems
to 
me 
free; 
but 
asking 
myself 
whether 
I 
could 
raise 
my 
arm 
in 
every
direction, 
I 
see 
that 
I 
raised 
it 
in 
the 
direction 
in 
which 
there 
was
least 
obstruction 
to 
that 
action 
either 
from 
things 
around 
me 
or 
from
the 
construction 
of 
my 
own 
body. 
I 
chose 
one 
out 
of 
all 
the 
possible
directions 
because 
in 
it 
there 
were 
fewest 
obstacles. 
For 
my 
action
to 
be 
free 
it 
was 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
encounter 
no 
obstacles. 
To
conceive 
of 
a 
man 
being 
free 
we 
must 
imagine 
him 
outside 
space, 
which 
is
evidently 
impossible.

(2) 
However 
much 
we 
approximate 
the 
time 
of 
judgment 
to 
the 
time 
of 
the
deed, 
we 
never 
get 
a 
conception 
of 
freedom 
in 
time. 
For 
if 
I 
examine
an 
action 
committed 
a 
second 
ago 
I 
must 
still 
recognize 
it 
as 
not
being 
free, 
for 
it 
is 
irrevocably 
linked 
to 
the 
moment 
at 
which 
it 
was
committed. 
Can 
I 
lift 
my 
arm? 
I 
lift 
it, 
but 
ask 
myself: 
could 
I 
have
abstained 
from 
lifting 
my 
arm 
at 
the 
moment 
that 
has 
already 
passed? 
To
convince 
myself 
of 
this 
I 
do 
not 
lift 
it 
the 
next 
moment. 
But 
I 
am
not 
now 
abstaining 
from 
doing 
so 
at 
the 
first 
moment 
when 
I 
asked 
the
question. 
Time 
has 
gone 
by 
which 
I 
could 
not 
detain, 
the 
arm 
I 
then
lifted 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
same 
as 
the 
arm 
I 
now 
refrain 
from 
lifting,
nor 
is 
the 
air 
in 
which 
I 
lifted 
it 
the 
same 
that 
now 
surrounds 
me. 
The
moment 
in 
which 
the 
first 
movement 
was 
made 
is 
irrevocable, 
and 
at 
that
moment 
I 
could 
make 
only 
one 
movement,<p>
and 
whatever 
movement 
I 
made
would 
be 
the 
only 
one. 
That 
I 
did 
not 
lift 
my 
arm 
a 
moment 
later 
does
not 
prove 
that 
I 
could 
have 
abstained 
from 
lifting 
it 
then. 
And 
since 
I
could 
make 
only 
one 
movement 
at 
that 
single 
moment 
of 
time, 
it 
could 
not
have 
been 
any 
other. 
To 
imagine 
it 
as 
free, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
imagine
it 
in 
the 
present, 
on 
the 
boundary 
between 
the 
past 
and 
the 
future-that
is, 
outside 
time, 
which 
is 
impossible.

(3) 
However 
much 
the 
difficulty 
of 
understanding 
the 
causes 
may 
be
increased, 
we<p>
never 
reach 
a 
conception 
of 
complete 
freedom, 
that 
is,
an 
absence 
of 
cause. 
However 
inaccessible 
to 
us 
may 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
the
expression 
of 
will 
in 
any 
action,<p>
our 
own 
or 
another's, 
the 
first 
demand
of 
reason 
is 
the 
assumption 
of 
and 
search 
for 
a 
cause, 
for 
without 
a
cause 
no 
phenomenon 
is 
conceivable. 
I 
raise 
my 
arm 
to 
perform 
an 
action
independently 
of 
any 
cause, 
but 
my 
wish 
to 
perform 
an 
action 
without 
a
cause 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
my 
action.

But 
even 
if-imagining 
a 
man 
quite 
exempt 
from 
all 
influences, 
examining
only 
his 
momentary 
action 
in 
the 
present, 
unevoked 
by 
any 
cause-we 
were
to 
admit 
so 
infinitely 
small 
a 
remainder 
of 
inevitability 
as 
equaled
zero, 
we 
should 
even 
then 
not 
have 
arrived 
at 
the 
conception 
of 
complete
freedom 
in 
man, 
for 
a 
being 
uninfluenced 
by 
the 
external 
world, 
standing
outside 
of 
time 
and 
independent 
of 
cause, 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
man.

In 
the 
same 
way 
we 
can 
never 
imagine 
the 
action 
of 
a 
man 
quite 
devoid 
of
freedom 
and 
entirely 
subject 
to 
the 
law 
of 
inevitability.

(1) 
However 
we 
may 
increase 
our 
knowledge 
of 
the 
conditions 
of 
space
in 
which 
man 
is 
situated, 
that 
knowledge 
can 
never 
be 
complete, 
for 
the
number 
of 
those 
conditions 
is 
as 
infinite 
as 
the 
infinity 
of 
space. 
And
therefore 
so 
long 
as 
not 
all 
the 
conditions 
influencing 
men 
are
