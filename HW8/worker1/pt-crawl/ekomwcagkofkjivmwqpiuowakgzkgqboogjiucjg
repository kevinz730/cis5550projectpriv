acted 
in 
contradiction
to 
all 
those 
rules. 
She 
felt 
that 
the 
allurements 
instinct 
had 
formerly
taught 
her 
to 
use 
would 
now 
be 
merely 
ridiculous 
in 
the<p>
eyes 
of
her 
husband, 
to 
whom 
she 
had 
from 
the 
first 
moment 
given 
herself 
up
entirely-that 
is, 
with 
her 
whole 
soul, 
leaving 
no 
corner 
of 
it 
hidden
from 
him. 
She 
felt 
that 
her 
unity 
with 
her 
husband 
was 
not 
maintained
by 
the 
poetic 
feelings 
that 
had 
attracted 
him 
to 
her, 
but 
by 
something
else-indefinite 
but 
firm 
as 
the 
bond 
between 
her 
own 
body 
and 
soul.

To 
fluff 
out 
her 
curls, 
put 
on 
fashionable 
dresses, 
and 
sing 
romantic
songs 
to 
fascinate 
her 
husband 
would 
have 
seemed 
as 
strange 
as 
to 
adorn
herself 
to 
attract 
herself. 
To 
adorn 
herself 
for 
others 
might 
perhaps
have 
been 
agreeable-she 
did 
not 
know-but 
she 
had 
no 
time 
at 
all 
for 
it.
The 
chief 
reason 
for 
devoting 
no 
time 
either 
to 
singing, 
to 
dress, 
or
to 
choosing 
her 
words 
was 
that 
she 
really 
had 
no 
time 
to 
spare 
for 
these
things.

We 
know 
that 
man 
has 
the 
faculty 
of 
becoming 
completely 
absorbed 
in
a 
subject 
however 
trivial 
it 
may 
be, 
and 
that 
there 
is 
no 
subject 
so
trivial 
that 
it 
will 
not 
grow 
to 
infinite 
proportions 
if 
one's 
entire
attention 
is 
devoted 
to 
it.

The 
subject 
which 
wholly 
engrossed 
Natasha's 
attention 
was 
her 
family:
that 
is, 
her 
husband 
whom 
she 
had 
to 
keep 
so 
that 
he 
should 
belong
entirely 
to 
her 
and 
to 
the 
home, 
and 
the 
children 
whom 
she 
had 
to 
bear,
bring 
into 
the 
world, 
nurse, 
and 
bring 
up.

And 
the 
deeper 
she 
penetrated, 
not 
with 
her 
mind 
only 
but 
with 
her 
whole
soul, 
her 
whole 
being, 
into 
the 
subject 
that 
absorbed 
her, 
the 
larger
did 
that 
subject 
grow 
and 
the 
weaker 
and 
more 
inadequate 
did 
her 
powers
appear, 
so 
that 
she 
concentrated 
them 
wholly 
on 
that 
one 
thing 
and 
yet
was 
unable 
to 
accomplish 
all 
that 
she 
considered 
necessary.

There<p>
were 
then 
as 
now 
conversations 
and 
discussions 
about 
women's
rights, 
the 
relations 
of 
husband 
and 
wife 
and 
their 
freedom 
and 
rights,
though 
these 
themes 
were 
not 
yet 
termed 
questions 
as 
they 
are 
now; 
but
these 
topics 
were 
not 
merely 
uninteresting 
to 
Natasha, 
she 
positively
did 
not 
understand 
them.

These 
questions, 
then 
as 
now, 
existed 
only 
for 
those 
who 
see 
nothing 
in
marriage 
but 
the 
pleasure 
married 
people 
get 
from 
one 
another, 
that 
is,
only 
the 
beginnings 
of 
marriage 
and 
not 
its 
whole 
significance, 
which
lies 
in 
the 
family.

Discussions 
and 
questions 
of 
that 
kind, 
which 
are 
like 
the 
question 
of
how 
to 
get 
the 
greatest 
gratification 
from 
one's 
dinner, 
did 
not 
then
and 
do 
not 
now 
exist 
for 
those 
for 
whom 
the 
purpose<p>
of 
a 
dinner 
is 
the
nourishment 
it 
affords; 
and 
the 
purpose 
of 
marriage 
is 
the 
family.

If 
the 
purpose 
of 
dinner 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rg15uFRs2Qc.html">is</a> 
to 
nourish 
the 
body, 
a 
man 
who 
eats 
two
dinners 
at 
once 
may 
perhaps
