like</h1>a 
street 
was 
left 
between 
each 
two 
lines 
of 
troops. 
The
three 
parts 
of 
that 
army 
were 
sharply 
distinguished: 
Kutuzov's
fighting 
army 
(with 
the 
Pavlograds 
on 
the 
right 
flank 
of 
the 
front);
those 
recently 
arrived 
from 
Russia, 
both 
Guards 
and 
regiments 
of 
the
line; 
and 
the 
Austrian 
troops. 
But 
they 
all 
stood 
in 
the 
same 
lines,
under 
one 
command, 
and 
in 
a 
like 
order.

Like 
wind 
over 
leaves 
ran 
an 
excited 
whisper: 
"They're 
coming!
They're 
coming!" 
Alarmed 
voices 
were 
heard, 
and 
a 
stir 
of 
final
preparation 
swept 
over 
all 
the 
troops.

From 
the 
direction 
of 
Olmuetz 
in 
front 
of 
them, 
a 
group 
was 
seen
approaching. 
And 
at 
that 
moment, 
though 
the<p>
day 
was 
still, 
a 
light 
gust
of 
wind 
blowing 
over 
the 
army 
slightly 
stirred 
the 
streamers 
on 
the
lances<p>
and 
the 
unfolded 
standards 
fluttered 
against 
their 
staffs. 
It
looked 
as 
if 
by 
that 
slight 
motion 
the 
army 
itself 
was 
expressing 
its
joy 
at 
the 
approach 
of 
the 
Emperors. 
One 
voice 
was 
heard 
shouting:
"Eyes 
front!" 
Then, 
like 
the 
crowing 
of 
cocks 
at 
sunrise,<p>
this 
was
repeated 
by 
others 
from 
various 
sides 
and 
all 
became 
silent.

In 
the 
deathlike 
stillness 
only 
the 
tramp 
of 
horses 
was 
heard. 
This
was 
the 
Emperors' 
suites. 
The 
Emperors 
rode 
up 
to 
the 
flank, 
and 
the
trumpets 
of 
the 
first 
cavalry 
regiment 
played 
the 
general 
march. 
It
seemed 
as 
though 
not 
the 
trumpeters 
were 
playing, 
but 
as 
if 
the 
army
itself, 
rejoicing 
at 
the 
Emperors' 
approach, 
had 
naturally 
burst 
into
music. 
Amid 
these 
sounds, 
only 
the 
youthful 
kindly 
voice 
of 
the 
Emperor
Alexander 
was 
clearly 
heard. 
He 
gave 
the 
words 
of 
greeting, 
and 
the
first 
regiment 
roared 
"Hurrah!" 
so 
deafeningly, 
continuously, 
and
joyfully 
that 
the 
men 
themselves 
were 
awed 
by 
their 
multitude 
and 
the
immensity 
of 
the 
power 
they 
constituted.

Rostov, 
standing 
in 
the 
front 
lines 
of 
Kutuzov's 
army 
which 
the 
Tsar
approached 
first, 
experienced 
the 
same 
feeling 
as 
every 
other 
man 
in
that 
army: 
a 
feeling 
of 
self-forgetfulness, 
a 
proud 
consciousness 
of
might, 
and 
a 
passionate 
attraction 
to 
him 
who 
was 
the 
cause 
of 
this
triumph.

He 
felt 
that 
at 
a 
single 
word 
from 
that 
man 
all<p>
this 
vast 
mass 
(and 
he
himself 
an 
insignificant 
atom 
in 
it) 
would<p>
go 
through 
fire 
and 
water,
commit 
crime, 
die, 
or 
perform 
deeds 
of 
highest 
heroism, 
and 
so 
he 
could
not 
but 
tremble 
and 
his 
heart 
stand 
still 
at 
the 
imminence 
of 
that 
word.

"Hurrah! 
Hurrah! 
Hurrah!" 
thundered 
from 
all 
sides, 
one 
regiment
after 
another 
greeting 
the 
Tsar 
with 
the 
strains 
of<p>
the 
march, 
and 
then
"Hurrah!"... 
Then 
the 
general 
march, 
and 
again 
"Hurrah! 
Hurrah!"
growing 
ever 
stronger 
and 
fuller 
and 
merging 
into 
a 
deafening 
roar.

Till 
the 
Tsar 
reached 
it, 
each 
regiment 
in 
its 
silence 
and 
immobility
seemed 
like 
a 
lifeless 
body, 
but 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
came 
up 
it<p>
became 
alive,
its 
thunder 
joining 
the 
roar 
of 
the 
whole 
line 
along 
which 
he 
had
already 
passed. 
Through 
the 
terrible 
and 
deafening 
roar 
of 
those 
voices,
amid 
the 
square 
masses 
of 
troops 
standing 
motionless 
as 
if 
turned 
to
stone, 
hundreds 
of 
riders 
composing 
the 
suites 
moved 
carelessly 
but
symmetrically 
and 
above 
all 
freely, 
and 
in 
front 
of 
them 
two 
men-the
Emperors. 
Upon 
them 
the 
undivided, 
tensely 
passionate 
attention 
of 
that
whole 
mass 
of 
men 
was 
concentrated.

The 
handsome 
young 
Emperor 
Alexander, 
in 
the 
uniform 
of 
the 
Horse
Guards, 
wearing 
a 
cocked 
hat 
with 
its<p>
peaks 
front 
and 
back, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Bw1ws4vVJZj8mJ.html">with</a> 
his
pleasant 
face 
and 
resonant 
though 
not 
loud 
voice, 
attracted 
everyone's
attention.

from 
the 
trumpeters,
