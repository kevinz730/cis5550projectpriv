And</h1>his 
plighted

That

Rostov

CHAPTER 
XV

On 
receiving 
command 
of 
the 
armies 
Kutuzov 
remembered 
Prince 
Andrew 
and
sent 
an 
order 
for 
him 
to 
report 
at 
headquarters.

Prince 
Andrew 
arrived 
at 
Tsarevo-Zaymishche 
on 
the 
very 
day 
and 
at 
the
very 
hour 
that 
Kutuzov 
was 
reviewing 
the 
troops 
for 
the 
first 
time. 
He
stopped 
in 
the 
village 
at 
the 
priest's 
house 
in 
<a href="/cZl/dA2tQI5SC4.html">front</a> 
of 
which 
stood 
the
commander 
in 
chief's 
carriage, 
and 
he 
sat 
down 
on 
the 
bench 
at 
the 
gate
awaiting 
his 
Serene 
Highness, 
as 
everyone 
now 
called 
Kutuzov. 
From 
the
field 
beyond 
the 
village 
came 
now 
sounds 
of 
regimental 
music 
<a href="/aVzUge/mK9b97YIp.html">and</a> 
now 
the
roar 
of 
many 
voices 
shouting 
"Hurrah!" 
to 
the 
new 
commander 
in 
chief.
Two 
orderlies, 
a 
courier 
and 
a 
major-domo, 
stood 
near 
by, 
some 
ten 
paces
from 
Prince 
Andrew, 
availing 
themselves 
of 
Kutuzov's 
absence 
and 
of 
the
fine 
weather. 
A 
short, 
swarthy 
lieutenant 
colonel 
of 
hussars 
with 
thick
mustaches 
and 
whiskers 
rode 
up 
to 
the 
gate 
and, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ne8NSUp0bmpaY5.html">glancing</a> 
at 
Prince
Andrew, 
inquired 
whether 
his 
Serene 
Highness 
was 
putting 
up 
there 
and
whether 
he 
would 
soon 
be 
back.

Prince 
Andrew 
replied 
that 
he 
was 
not 
on 
his 
Serene 
Highness' 
staff
but 
was 
himself 
a 
new<p>
arrival. 
The 
lieutenant 
colonel 
turned 
to 
a 
smart
orderly, 
who, 
with 
the 
peculiar 
contempt 
with 
which 
a 
commander<p>
in
chief's 
orderly 
speaks 
to 
officers, 
replied:

"What? 
His 
Serene 
Highness? 
I 
expect 
he'll 
be 
here 
soon. 
What 
do 
you
want?"

The 
lieutenant 
colonel 
of 
hussars 
smiled 
beneath 
his 
mustache 
at 
the
orderly's 
tone, 
dismounted, 
gave 
his 
horse 
to 
a 
dispatch 
runner, 
and
approached 
Bolkonski 
with 
a 
slight 
bow. 
Bolkonski 
made 
room 
for 
him 
on
the 
bench 
and 
the 
lieutenant 
colonel 
sat 
down 
beside 
him.

"You're 
also 
waiting 
for 
the 
commander 
in 
chief?" 
said 
he. 
"They 
say 
he
weceives 
evewyone, 
thank 
God!... 
It's 
awful 
with 
those 
sausage 
eaters!
Ermolov 
had 
weason 
to 
ask 
to 
be 
pwomoted 
to 
be 
a 
German! 
Now 
p'waps
Wussians 
will 
get 
a 
look 
<a href="/aVzUge/Pv5U1KSVyY6CmwX.html">in.</a> 
As 
it 
was, 
devil 
only 
knows 
what 
was
happening. 
We 
kept 
wetweating 
and 
wetweating. 
Did 
you 
take 
part 
in 
the
campaign?" 
he 
asked.

"I 
had 
the 
pleasure," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"not 
only 
of 
taking 
part 
in
the 
retreat 
but 
of 
losing 
in 
that 
retreat 
all 
I 
held 
dear-not 
to 
mention
the 
estate 
and 
home 
of 
my 
birth-my 
father, 
who 
died 
of 
grief. 
I 
belong
to<p>
the 
province 
of 
Smolensk."

"Ah? 
You're 
Pwince 
Bolkonski? 
Vewy 
glad 
to 
make 
your 
acquaintance! 
<a href="/cZl/mT2R8XKBx3.html">I'm
Lieutenant</a> 
Colonel 
Denisov, 
better 
known 
as 
'Vaska,'" 
said 
Denisov,
pressing 
Prince 
Andrew's 
hand 
and 
looking 
into 
his 
face 
with 
a
particularly 
kindly 
attention. 
"Yes, 
I 
heard," 
said 
he 
sympathetically,
and 
after 
a 
short 
pause 
added: 
"Yes, 
it's 
Scythian 
warfare. 
It's 
all
vewy 
well-only 
not<p>
for 
those 
who 
get 
it 
in 
the 
neck.
