He</h1>looked 
at 
her 
attentively.

"Is 
it 
about 
Nicholas?" 
he 
asked.

Princess 
Mary 
nodded 
her 
head, 
weeping.

"Mary, 
you 
know 
the 
Gosp..." 
but 
he 
broke 
off.

"What 
did 
you 
say?"

"Nothing. 
You 
mustn't 
cry 
here," 
he 
said, 
looking 
at 
her 
with 
the 
same
cold 
expression.


When 
Princess 
Mary 
<a href="/cZl/iP4INZ3gK6BwgT.html">began</a> 
to 
cry, 
he 
understood 
that 
she 
was 
crying 
at
the 
thought 
that 
little 
Nicholas 
would 
be 
left 
without 
a 
father. 
With
a 
great 
effort 
he 
tried 
to 
return 
to 
life 
and 
to 
see 
things 
from 
their
point 
of 
view.

"Yes, 
to 
them 
it 
must 
seem 
sad!" 
he 
thought. 
"But 
how 
simple 
it 
is.

"The 
fowls 
of 
the 
air 
sow 
not,<p>
neither 
do 
they 
reap, 
yet 
your 
Father
feedeth 
them," 
he 
said 
to 
himself 
and 
wished 
to 
say 
to 
Princess 
Mary;
"but 
no, 
they 
will 
take 
it 
their 
own 
way, 
they 
won't 
understand! 
They
can't 
understand 
that 
all 
those 
feelings 
they 
prize 
so-all 
our 
feelings,
all 
those 
ideas 
that 
seem 
so 
important 
to 
us, 
are 
unnecessary. 
We 
cannot
understand 
one 
another," 
and 
he 
remained 
silent.


Prince 
Andrew's 
little 
son 
was 
seven. 
He 
could 
scarcely 
read, 
and 
knew
nothing. 
After 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/zD34lOZ0.html">that</a> 
day 
he 
lived 
through 
many 
things, 
gaining 
knowledge,
observation, 
and 
experience, 
but 
had 
he 
possessed 
all 
the 
faculties 
he
afterwards 
acquired, 
he 
could 
not 
have 
had 
a 
better 
or 
more 
profound
understanding 
of 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
scene 
he 
had 
witnessed 
between
his 
father, 
Mary, 
and 
Natasha, 
than 
he 
had 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tH8CmeS2COCd0dBoY.html">then.</a> 
He 
understood 
it
completely, 
and,<p>
leaving 
the 
room 
without 
crying, 
went 
silently 
up
to 
Natasha 
who 
had 
come 
out 
with 
him 
and 
looked 
shyly 
at 
her 
with 
his
beautiful, 
thoughtful 
eyes, 
then 
his 
uplifted, 
rosy 
upper 
lip 
trembled
and 
leaning 
his 
head 
against 
her 
he 
began 
to 
cry.

After 
that 
he 
avoided 
Dessalles 
and 
the 
countess 
who 
caressed 
him 
and
either 
sat 
alone 
or 
came 
timidly 
to 
Princess 
Mary, 
or 
to 
Natasha 
of 
whom
he 
seemed 
even 
fonder 
than 
of 
his 
aunt, 
and 
clung 
to 
them 
quietly 
and
shyly.

When 
Princess 
Mary 
had 
left 
Prince 
Andrew 
she 
fully 
understood 
what
Natasha's 
face 
had 
told 
her. 
She 
did 
not 
speak 
any 
more 
to 
Natasha 
of
hopes 
of 
saving 
his 
life. 
She 
took 
turns 
with 
her 
beside 
his 
sofa, 
and
did 
not 
cry 
any 
more, 
but 
prayed 
continually, 
turning 
in 
soul 
to 
that
Eternal 
and 
Unfathomable, 
whose 
presence 
above 
the 
dying 
man 
was 
now 
so
evident.
