she 
drew</h1>from
the 
guitar 
would 
have 
had 
no 
meaning 
for 
other 
listeners, 
but 
in 
her
imagination 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
reminiscences 
arose 
from 
those 
sounds.
She 
sat 
behind 
the 
bookcase 
with 
her 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
a 
streak 
of 
light
escaping 
from 
the 
pantry 
door 
and 
listened 
to 
herself 
and 
pondered. 
She
was 
in 
a 
mood 
for 
brooding 
on 
the 
past.

Sonya 
passed 
to 
the 
pantry 
with 
a 
glass 
in 
her 
hand. 
Natasha 
glanced
at 
her 
and 
at 
the 
crack 
in 
the 
pantry 
door, 
and 
it 
seemed 
to 
her 
that
she 
remembered 
the 
light 
falling 
through 
that 
crack 
once 
before 
and
Sonya 
passing 
with 
a 
glass 
in 
her 
hand. 
"Yes 
it 
was 
exactly 
the
same," 
thought 
Natasha.

"Sonya, 
what 
is 
this?" 
she 
cried, 
twanging 
a 
thick 
string.

"Oh, 
you 
are 
there!" 
said 
Sonya 
with 
a 
start, 
and 
came 
near 
and
listened. 
"I 
don't 
know. 
A 
storm?" 
she 
ventured 
timidly, 
afraid 
of
being 
wrong.

"There! 
That's 
just 
how 
she 
started 
and 
just 
how 
she 
came 
up 
smiling
timidly 
when 
all 
this 
happened 
before," 
thought 
Natasha, 
"and 
in
just 
the 
same 
way 
I 
thought 
there 
was 
something 
lacking 
in 
her."

"No, 
it's 
the 
chorus 
from 
The 
Water-Carrier, 
listen!" 
and 
Natasha
sang 
the 
air 
of 
the 
chorus 
so 
that 
Sonya 
should<p>
catch 
it. 
"Where 
were
you<p>
going?" 
she 
asked.

"To 
change 
the 
water 
in 
this 
glass. 
I 
am 
just 
finishing 
the 
design."

"You 
always 
find 
something 
to 
do, 
but 
I 
can't," 
said 
Natasha.
"And 
where's 
Nicholas?"

"Asleep, 
I 
think."

"Sonya, 
go 
and 
wake 
him," 
said 
Natasha. 
"Tell 
him 
I 
want 
him 
to
come 
and 
sing."

She 
sat 
awhile, 
wondering 
what 
the 
meaning 
of 
it 
all 
having 
happened
before 
could 
be, 
and 
without 
solving 
this 
problem, 
or 
at 
all 
regretting
not 
having 
done 
so, 
she 
again 
passed 
in 
fancy 
to 
the 
time 
when 
she 
was
with 
him 
and 
he 
was 
looking 
at 
her 
with 
a 
lover's 
eyes.

"Oh, 
if 
only 
he 
would 
come 
quicker! 
I 
am 
so<p>
afraid 
it 
will 
never 
be!
And, 
worst 
of 
all, 
I 
am 
growing 
old-that's 
the 
thing! 
There 
won't
then 
be 
in 
me 
what 
there 
is 
now. 
But 
perhaps 
he'll 
come 
today, 
will
come 
immediately. 
Perhaps 
he 
has 
come 
and 
is 
sitting 
in 
the 
drawing
room. 
Perhaps 
he 
came 
yesterday 
and 
I 
have 
forgotten 
it." 
She 
rose,
put 
down 
the 
guitar, 
and 
went 
to 
the 
drawing 
room.

All 
the 
domestic 
circle, 
tutors, 
governesses, 
and 
guests, 
were 
already
at 
the 
tea 
table. 
The 
servants 
stood 
round 
the 
table-but 
Prince 
Andrew
was 
not 
there 
and 
life 
was 
going 
on 
as 
before.

"Ah, 
here 
she 
is!" 
said 
the 
old 
count, 
when 
he 
saw 
Natasha 
enter.
"Well, 
sit 
down 
by 
me." 
But 
Natasha 
stayed 
by 
her 
mother 
and
glanced 
round 
as 
if 
looking 
for 
something.

"Mamma!" 
she 
muttered, 
"give 
him 
to 
me, 
give 
him, 
Mamma, 
quickly,
quickly!" 
and 
she 
again 
had 
difficulty 
in 
repressing 
her 
sobs.

She 
sat 
down 
at 
the 
table 
and 
listened 
to 
the 
conversation 
between 
the
elders 
and 
Nicholas, 
who 
had 
also 
come 
to 
the 
table. 
"My 
God, 
my 
God!
The 
same 
faces, 
the 
same 
talk, 
Papa 
holding 
his 
cup 
and 
blowing 
in 
the
same 
way!" 
thought 
Natasha, 
feeling 
with 
horror 
a 
sense 
of 
repulsion
rising 
up 
in 
her 
for 
the 
whole 
household, 
because 
they 
were 
always 
the
same.

After 
tea, 
Nicholas, 
Sonya, 
and 
Natasha 
went 
to 
the 
sitting 
room, 
to
their 
favorite 
corner 
where
