one 
after 
another. 
The</h1>shot 
rattled 
against
the 
stone 
of 
the 
gate 
and 
upon 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZLk8MCK3bju5WkvgW.html">the</a> 
wooden 
beams 
and 
screens, 
and 
two
wavering 
<a href="/cZl/LW3viB8U3epgGc.html">clouds</a> 
of 
smoke 
rose 
over 
the 
Square.

A 
few 
instants 
after 
the 
echo 
of 
the 
reports 
resounding 
over 
the
stone-built 
Kremlin 
had 
died 
away 
the 
French 
heard 
a 
strange 
sound 
above
their 
head. 
Thousands 
of 
crows 
rose 
above 
the 
walls 
and 
circled 
in 
the
air, 
cawing 
and 
noisily 
flapping 
their 
wings. 
Together 
with 
that 
sound
came 
a 
solitary 
human 
cry 
from 
the 
gateway 
and 
amid 
the 
smoke 
appeared
the 
figure 
of 
a 
bareheaded 
man 
in 
a 
peasant's 
coat. 
He 
grasped 
a 
musket
and 
took 
aim 
at 
the 
French. 
"Fire!" 
repeated 
the 
officer 
once 
more,
and 
the 
reports 
of 
a 
musket 
and 
of 
two 
cannon 
shots 
were 
heard
simultaneously. 
The 
gate 
was 
again 
hidden 
by 
smoke.

Nothing 
more 
stirred 
behind 
the 
screens 
and 
the 
French 
infantry 
soldiers
and 
officers 
advanced 
to 
the 
gate. 
In 
the<p>
gateway 
lay 
three 
wounded 
and
four 
dead. 
Two 
men 
in 
peasant 
coats 
ran 
away 
at 
the 
foot 
of 
the 
wall,
toward 
the 
Znamenka.

"Clear 
that 
away!" 
said 
the 
officer, 
pointing 
to 
the 
beams 
and 
the
corpses, 
and 
the 
French 
soldiers, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/gv8sCi8PFi5qB.html">after</a> 
dispatching 
the 
wounded, 
threw
the 
corpses 
over 
the 
parapet.

Who 
these 
men 
were 
nobody 
knew.<p>
"Clear 
that 
away!" 
was 
all 
that 
was 
said
of 
them, 
and 
they 
were 
thrown 
over 
the 
parapet 
and 
removed 
later 
on 
that
they 
might 
not 
stink. 
Thiers 
alone 
dedicates 
a 
few 
eloquent 
lines 
to
their 
memory: 
"These 
wretches 
had 
occupied 
the 
sacred 
citadel, 
having
supplied 
themselves 
with 
guns 
from 
the 
arsenal, 
and 
fired" 
(the
wretches) 
"at 
the 
French. 
Some 
of 
them 
were 
sabered 
and 
the 
Kremlin 
was
purged 
of 
their 
presence."

Murat 
was 
informed 
that 
the 
way 
had<p>
been 
cleared. 
The 
French 
entered
the 
gates 
and 
began 
pitching 
their 
camp 
in 
the 
Senate 
Square. 
Out 
of 
the
windows 
of 
the 
Senate 
House 
the 
soldiers 
threw 
chairs 
into 
the 
Square
for 
fuel 
and 
kindled 
fires 
there.

Other 
detachments 
passed 
through 
the 
Kremlin 
and 
encamped 
along
the 
Moroseyka, 
the 
Lubyanka, 
and 
Pokrovka 
Streets. 
Others 
quartered
themselves 
along 
the 
Vozdvizhenka, 
the 
Nikolski, 
and 
the 
Tverskoy
Streets. 
No 
masters 
of 
the 
houses 
being 
found 
anywhere, 
the 
French 
were
not 
billeted 
on 
the 
inhabitants 
as 
is 
usual 
in 
towns 
but 
lived 
in 
it 
as
in 
a 
camp.

tattered,
