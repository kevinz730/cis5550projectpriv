a</h1>soldier?
If 
a 
soldier, 
he 
should 
be 
dressed 
in 
regulation 
uniform 
like 
the
others."

"Your 
excellency, 
you 
gave 
him 
leave 
yourself, 
on 
the 
march."

"Gave 
him 
leave? 
Leave? 
That's 
just 
like 
you 
young 
men," 
said<p>
the
regimental 
commander 
cooling 
down 
a 
little. 
"Leave 
indeed.... 
One 
says
a 
word 
to 
you 
and 
you... 
What?" 
he 
added 
with 
renewed 
irritation, 
"I
beg 
you 
to 
dress 
your 
men 
decently."

And 
the 
commander, 
turning 
to 
look 
at 
the 
adjutant, 
directed 
his 
jerky
steps 
down 
the 
line. 
He 
was 
evidently 
pleased 
at 
his 
own 
display 
of
anger 
and 
walking 
up 
to 
the 
regiment 
wished 
to 
find 
a 
further 
excuse 
for
wrath. 
Having 
snapped 
at 
an 
officer 
for 
an 
unpolished 
badge, 
at 
another
because 
his 
line 
was 
not 
straight, 
he 
reached 
the 
third 
company.

"H-o-o-w 
are 
you 
standing? 
Where's 
your 
leg? 
Your 
leg?" 
shouted
the 
commander 
with 
a 
tone 
of 
suffering 
in 
his 
voice, 
while 
there 
were
still 
five 
men 
between 
him 
and 
Dolokhov 
with 
his 
bluish-gray 
uniform.

Dolokhov 
slowly 
straightened 
his 
bent 
knee, 
looking 
straight 
with 
his
clear, 
insolent 
eyes 
in 
the 
general's 
face.

"Why 
a 
blue 
coat? 
Off 
with 
it... 
Sergeant 
major! 
Change 
his 
coat...
the 
ras..." 
he 
did 
not 
finish.

"General, 
I 
must 
obey 
orders, 
but 
I 
am 
not 
bound 
to 
endure..."
Dolokhov 
hurriedly 
interrupted.

"No 
talking 
in 
the 
ranks!... 
No 
talking, 
no 
talking!"

"Not 
bound 
to 
endure 
insults," 
Dolokhov 
concluded 
in 
loud, 
ringing
tones.

The 
eyes 
of 
the 
general 
and 
the 
soldier 
met. 
The 
general 
became 
silent,
angrily 
pulling 
down 
his 
tight 
scarf.

"I 
request 
you 
to 
have 
the 
goodness 
to 
change 
your 
coat," 
he 
said 
as
he 
turned 
away.





CHAPTER 
II

"He's 
coming!" 
shouted 
the 
signaler 
at 
that 
moment.

The 
regimental 
commander, 
flushing, 
ran 
to 
his 
horse, 
seized 
the 
stirrup
with 
trembling 
hands, 
threw 
his 
body 
across 
the 
saddle, 
righted 
himself,
drew 
his 
saber, 
and 
with 
a<p>
happy 
and 
resolute 
countenance, 
opening
his 
mouth 
awry, 
prepared 
to 
shout. 
The 
regiment 
fluttered 
like 
a 
bird
preening 
its 
plumage 
and<p>
became 
motionless.

"Att-ention!" 
shouted 
the 
regimental 
commander 
in 
a 
soul-shaking
voice 
which 
expressed 
joy 
for 
himself, 
severity 
for 
the 
regiment, 
and
welcome 
for 
the 
approaching 
chief.

Along 
the 
broad 
country 
road, 
edged 
on 
both 
sides 
by 
trees, 
came 
a 
high,
light 
blue 
Viennese 
caleche, 
slightly 
creaking 
on 
its 
springs 
and 
drawn
by 
six 
horses 
at 
a 
smart 
trot. 
Behind 
the 
caleche 
galloped 
the 
suite
and 
a 
convoy 
of 
Croats. 
Beside 
Kutuzov 
sat 
an 
Austrian 
general, 
in
a 
white 
uniform 
that 
looked 
strange 
among 
the 
Russian 
black 
ones. 
The
caleche 
stopped 
in 
front 
of 
the 
regiment. 
Kutuzov 
and 
the 
Austrian
general 
were 
talking 
in 
low 
voices 
and 
Kutuzov 
smiled 
slightly 
as
treading 
heavily 
he 
stepped 
down 
from 
the 
carriage 
just 
as 
if 
those 
two
thousand 
men 
breathlessly 
gazing 
at 
him 
and 
the 
regimental 
commander 
did
not 
exist.

The<p>
word 
of 
command 
rang 
out, 
and 
again 
the 
regiment 
quivered, 
as 
with 
a
jingling 
sound 
it 
presented 
arms. 
Then 
amidst 
a 
dead 
silence 
the
feeble 
voice 
of 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
was 
heard.<p>
The 
regiment 
roared,
"Health 
to 
your 
ex... 
len... 
len... 
lency!" 
and 
again 
all<p>
became
silent. 
At 
first 
Kutuzov 
stood 
still 
while 
the 
regiment 
moved; 
then 
he
and 
the 
general 
in 
white, 
accompanied 
by 
the 
suite, 
walked 
between 
the
ranks.

From 
the 
way 
the 
regimental 
commander 
saluted 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
and
devoured 
him 
with 
his 
eyes, 
drawing 
himself 
up 
obsequiously, 
and 
from
the 
way 
he 
walked 
through 
the 
ranks
