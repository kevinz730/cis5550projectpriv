tutors 
came, 
and</h1>the 
nurses, 
and
Dmitri, 
and 
several 
acquaintances, 
and 
the 
countess 
reread 
the 
letter
each 
time 
with 
fresh 
pleasure 
and 
each 
time 
discovered 
in 
it 
fresh
proofs 
of 
Nikolenka's 
virtues. 
How 
strange, 
how 
extraordinary, 
how
joyful 
it 
seemed, 
that 
her<p>
son, 
the 
scarcely 
perceptible 
motion 
of 
whose
tiny 
limbs 
she 
had 
felt 
twenty 
years 
ago 
within 
her, 
that 
son 
about 
whom
she 
used 
to 
have 
quarrels 
with 
the 
too 
indulgent 
count, 
that 
son 
who
had 
first 
learned 
to 
say 
"pear" 
and 
then 
"granny," 
that 
this 
son
should 
now 
be 
away 
in 
a 
foreign 
land 
amid 
strange 
surroundings, 
a 
manly
warrior 
doing 
some 
kind 
of 
man's 
work 
of 
his 
own, 
without 
help 
or
guidance. 
The 
universal 
experience 
of 
ages, 
showing 
that 
children 
do
grow 
imperceptibly 
from 
the<p>
cradle 
to 
manhood, 
did 
not 
exist 
for 
the
countess. 
Her 
son's 
growth 
toward 
manhood, 
at 
each 
of 
its 
stages,
had 
seemed 
as 
extraordinary 
to 
her 
as 
if 
there 
had 
never 
existed 
the
millions 
of 
human<p>
beings 
who 
grew 
up 
in 
the 
same 
way. 
As 
twenty
years 
before, 
it 
seemed 
impossible 
that 
the 
little 
creature 
who 
lived
somewhere 
under<p>
her 
heart 
would 
ever 
cry, 
suck 
her 
breast, 
and 
begin 
to
speak, 
so 
now 
she 
could 
not 
believe 
that 
that 
little 
creature 
could 
be
this 
strong, 
brave 
man, 
this 
model 
son 
and 
officer 
that, 
judging 
by 
this
letter, 
he 
now 
was.

"What 
a 
style! 
How 
charmingly 
he 
describes!" 
said 
she, 
reading 
the
descriptive 
part 
of 
the 
letter. 
"And 
what 
a 
soul! 
Not 
a 
word 
<a href="/aVzUge/mJ4lLv14.html">about
himself....</a> 
Not 
a 
word! 
About 
some 
Denisov 
or 
other, 
though 
he 
himself,
I 
dare 
say, 
is 
braver 
than 
any 
of 
them. 
He 
says 
nothing 
about 
his
sufferings. 
What 
a 
heart! 
How 
like 
him 
it 
is! 
And 
how 
he 
has 
remembered
everybody! 
Not 
forgetting 
anyone. 
I 
always 
said 
when 
he 
was 
only 
so
high-I 
always 
<a href="/aVzUge/au2EXJo3yFQ4.html">said...."

For</a> 
more 
than 
a 
week 
preparations 
were 
being 
made, 
rough 
drafts 
of
letters 
to 
Nicholas 
from 
all 
the 
household 
were 
written 
and 
copied 
out,
while 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
the 
countess 
and 
the 
solicitude 
of 
the
count, 
money 
and 
all 
things 
necessary 
for 
the 
uniform 
and 
equipment
of 
the 
newly 
commissioned 
officer 
were 
collected. 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna,
practical 
woman 
that 
she 
was, 
had 
even 
managed 
by 
favor 
with 
army
authorities 
to 
secure 
advantageous 
means 
of 
communication 
for 
herself
and 
her 
son. 
She 
had 
opportunities 
of 
sending 
her 
letters 
to 
the 
Grand
Duke 
Constantine 
Pavlovich, 
who 
commanded 
the 
Guards. 
The 
Rostovs
supposed 
that 
The 
Russian 
Guards, 
Abroad, 
was 
quite 
a 
definite 
address,
and 
that 
if 
a 
letter 
reached 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
in 
command 
of 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/MV4i45.html">Guards
there</a> 
was 
no 
reason 
why 
it 
should 
not 
reach 
the 
Pavlograd 
regiment,
which 
was 
presumably 
somewhere 
in 
the 
same<p>
neighborhood. 
And 
so 
it 
was
decided 
to 
send 
the 
letters 
and 
money 
by 
the 
Grand 
Duke's 
courier 
to
Boris 
and 
Boris 
was 
to 
forward 
them 
to 
Nicholas. 
The 
letters 
were 
from
the 
old 
count,

countess,
