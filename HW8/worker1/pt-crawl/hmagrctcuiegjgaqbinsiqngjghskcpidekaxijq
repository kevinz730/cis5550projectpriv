Is

eastward

expressed 
by 
details 
of 
the

Is

explained

For 
us 
that 
movement 
of 
the 
peoples 
from 
west 
to 
east, 
without
leaders, 
with 
a 
crowd 
of 
vagrants, 
and 
with 
Peter 
the 
Hermit, 
remains
incomprehensible. 
And 
yet 
more 
incomprehensible 
is 
the 
cessation 
of 
that
movement 
when 
a 
rational 
and 
sacred 
aim 
for 
the 
Crusade-the 
deliverance
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vW2hz4E4jct.html">Jerusalem-had</a> 
been 
clearly 
<a href="/cZl/ZM9U3.html">defined</a> 
by 
historic 
leaders. 
Popes, 
kings,
and 
knights 
incited 
the 
peoples 
to 
free 
the<p>
Holy 
Land; 
but 
the 
people
did 
not 
go, 
for<p>
the 
unknown 
cause 
which 
had 
previously 
impelled 
them 
to
go 
no 
longer 
existed. 
The 
history 
of 
the 
Godfreys 
and<p>
the 
Minnesingers
can 
evidently 
not 
cover 
the 
life 
of 
the 
peoples. 
And 
the 
history 
of 
the
Godfreys 
and 
the 
Minnesingers 
has 
remained 
the 
history 
of 
Godfreys
and 
Minnesingers, 
but 
the 
history 
of 
the 
life 
of 
the 
peoples 
and 
their
impulses 
has 
remained 
unknown.

Still 
less 
does 
the 
history 
of 
authors 
and 
reformers 
explain 
to 
us 
the
life 
of 
the 
peoples.

The 
history 
of 
culture 
explains 
to 
us 
the 
impulses 
and 
conditions 
of
life 
and 
thought 
of 
a 
writer 
or 
a 
reformer. 
We 
learn 
that 
Luther 
had
a 
hot 
temper 
and 
said 
such 
and 
such 
things; 
we 
learn 
that 
Rousseau 
was
suspicious 
and 
wrote 
such 
and 
such 
books; 
but 
we<p>
do 
not 
learn 
why 
after
the 
Reformation 
the 
peoples 
massacred 
one 
another, 
nor 
why 
during 
the
French 
Revolution 
they 
guillotined 
one 
another.

If 
we 
unite 
both 
these 
kinds 
of 
history, 
as 
is 
done 
by 
the 
newest
historians, 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
history 
of 
monarchs 
and 
writers, 
but 
not
the 
history 
of 
the 
life 
of 
the 
peoples.





CHAPTER 
V

The 
life 
of 
the 
nations 
is 
not 
contained 
in 
the 
lives 
of 
a 
few 
men, 
for
the 
connection 
between 
those 
men 
and 
the 
nations 
has 
not 
been 
found.
The 
theory 
that 
this 
connection 
is 
based 
on 
the 
transference 
of 
the
collective 
will 
of 
a 
people 
to 
certain 
historical 
personages 
is 
an
hypothesis 
unconfirmed<p>
by 
the 
experience 
of 
history.

The 
theory 
of 
the 
transference 
of 
the 
collective 
will 
of 
the 
people 
to
historic 
persons 
may 
perhaps 
explain 
much 
in 
the 
domain 
of 
jurisprudence
and 
be 
essential 
for 
its 
purposes, 
but 
in 
its 
application 
to 
history, 
as
soon 
as 
revolutions, 
conquests, 
or 
civil 
wars 
occur-that 
is, 
as 
soon 
as
history 
begins-that 
theory 
explains 
nothing.

The 
theory 
seems 
irrefutable 
just<p>
because 
the 
act 
of 
transference 
of 
the
people's 
will 
cannot 
be 
verified, 
for 
it 
never 
occurred.

Whatever 
happens 
and 
whoever 
may 
stand 
at 
the 
head 
of 
affairs, 
the
theory 
can 
always 
say 
that 
such 
and 
such 
a 
person 
took 
the 
lead 
because
the 
collective 
will 
was 
transferred 
to 
him.

The 
replies 
this 
theory 
gives 
to 
historical 
questions 
are 
like 
the
replies 
of 
a 
man 
who, 
watching 
the 
movements 
of 
a 
herd 
of 
cattle 
and
paying 
no 
attention 
to 
the 
varying 
quality 
of 
the 
pasturage 
in 
different
parts 
of 
the 
field, 
or 
to 
the 
driving 
of 
the 
herdsman, 
should 
attribute
the 
direction 
the 
herd 
takes 
to 
what 
animal 
happens 
to 
be 
at 
its 
head.

"The 
herd 
goes 
in 
that 
direction 
because 
the 
animal 
in 
front 
leads
it 
and 
the 
collective 
will 
of 
all 
the 
other 
animals 
is 
vested 
in<p>
that
leader." 
This 
is 
what 
historians 
of 
the 
first 
class 
say-those 
who 
assume
the 
unconditional 
transference 
of 
the 
people's 
will.

"If 
the 
animals 
leading 
the 
herd 
<a href="/cZl/io9bKMVG1gcFtr4IEXzL.html">change,</a> 
this 
happens 
because 
the
collective 
will 
of 
all 
the 
animals 
is 
transferred 
from 
one 
leader 
to
another, 
according 
to 
whether 
the 
animal 
is 
or 
is 
not 
leading 
them 
in
the 
direction 
selected 
by 
the 
whole 
herd." 
Such 
is 
the 
reply 
historians
who 
assume 
that
