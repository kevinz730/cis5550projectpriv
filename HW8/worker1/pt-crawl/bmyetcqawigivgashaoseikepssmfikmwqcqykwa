stuff!"
Denisov 
was 
shouting. 
"And</h1>I 
saw 
with 
my 
own 
eyes 
how 
Lazarchuk
bwought 
some 
fwom 
the 
fields."

"I 
have 
given 
the 
order 
again 
and 
again, 
your 
honor, 
but 
they 
<a href="/cZl/AJ1bE33yG.html">don't
obey,"</a> 
answered 
the 
quartermaster.

Rostov 
lay 
down 
again 
on 
his 
bed 
and 
thought 
complacently: 
"Let
him 
fuss 
and 
bustle 
now, 
my 
job's 
done 
and 
I'm 
lying
down-capitally!" 
He 
could 
hear 
that 
Lavrushka-that 
sly, 
bold
orderly 
of 
Denisov's-was 
talking, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
quartermaster.
Lavrushka 
was 
saying 
something 
about 
loaded 
wagons, 
biscuits, 
and 
oxen
he 
had 
seen 
when 
he 
had 
gone 
out 
for 
provisions.

Then 
Denisov's 
voice 
was 
heard 
shouting 
farther 
and 
farther 
away.
"Saddle! 
Second 
platoon!"

"Where 
are 
they 
off 
to 
now?" 
thought 
Rostov.

Five 
minutes 
later, 
Denisov 
came 
into 
the 
hut, 
climbed 
with 
muddy 
boots
on 
the 
bed, 
lit 
his 
pipe, 
furiously 
scattered 
his 
things 
<a href="/cZl/At7Jk8xt2r.html">about,</a> 
took
his 
leaded 
whip, 
buckled 
on 
his 
saber, 
and 
went 
out 
again. 
In 
answer 
to
Rostov's 
inquiry 
where 
he 
was 
going, 
he 
answered 
vaguely 
and 
crossly
that 
he 
had 
some 
business.

"Let 
God 
and 
our 
gweat 
monarch 
judge 
me 
afterwards!" 
said 
Denisov
going 
out, 
and 
Rostov 
heard 
the 
hoofs 
of 
several 
horses 
splashing
through 
the 
mud. 
He 
did 
not 
even 
trouble 
to 
find<p>
out 
where 
Denisov 
had
gone. 
Having 
got 
warm 
in 
his 
corner, 
he 
fell 
asleep 
and 
did 
not 
leave
the 
hut 
till 
toward 
evening. 
Denisov 
had 
not 
yet 
returned. 
The 
weather
had 
cleared 
up, 
and 
near 
the 
next 
hut 
two 
officers 
and 
a 
cadet 
were
playing 
svayka, 
laughing 
as 
they 
threw 
their 
missiles 
which 
buried
themselves 
in 
the 
soft 
mud. 
Rostov 
joined 
them.<p>
