the 
princess 
had 
maintained 
the
conversation 
very 
well, 
but 
at 
the 
very 
last 
moment, 
just 
when 
he 
rose,
she 
was 
so 
tired 
of 
talking 
of 
what 
did 
not 
interest 
her, 
and 
her
mind 
was 
so 
full 
of 
the 
question 
why 
she 
alone 
was 
granted 
so 
little
happiness 
in 
life,<p>
that 
in 
a 
fit 
of 
absent-mindedness 
she 
sat 
still, 
her
luminous 
eyes 
gazing 
fixedly 
before 
her, 
not 
noticing 
that 
he 
had 
risen.

Nicholas 
glanced 
at 
her 
and, 
wishing 
to 
appear 
not 
to 
notice 
her
abstraction, 
made 
some 
remark 
to 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
and 
then
again 
looked 
at 
the 
princess. 
She 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Kt1fqZYy6E2U.html">still</a> 
sat 
motionless 
<a href="/aVzUge/rP1Ikp3mbEd7.html">with</a> 
a 
look 
of
suffering 
on 
her 
gentle 
face. 
He 
suddenly 
felt 
sorry 
for 
her 
and 
was
vaguely 
conscious 
that 
he 
might 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
sadness 
her 
face
expressed. 
He 
wished 
to 
help 
her 
and 
say 
something 
pleasant, 
but 
could
think 
of 
nothing 
to 
say.

"Good-by, 
Princess!" 
said 
he.

She 
started, 
flushed, 
and 
sighed 
deeply.

"Oh, 
I 
beg 
your 
pardon," 
she 
said 
as 
if 
waking 
up. 
"Are 
you 
going
already, 
Count? 
Well 
then, 
good-by! 
Oh, 
but 
the 
cushion 
for 
the
countess!"

"Wait 
a 
moment, 
I'll 
fetch 
it," 
said 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
and 
she
left 
the 
room.

They 
both 
sat 
silent, 
with 
an 
occasional 
glance 
at 
one 
another.

"Yes, 
Princess," 
said 
Nicholas 
at 
last 
with 
a 
sad 
smile, 
"it 
doesn't
seem 
long 
ago 
since 
we 
first 
met 
at 
Bogucharovo, 
but 
how 
much 
water
has 
flowed 
since 
then! 
In 
what 
distress 
we 
all 
seemed 
to 
be 
then, 
yet
I 
would 
give 
much<p>
to 
bring 
back 
that 
time... 
but 
there's 
no 
bringing 
it
back."

Princess 
Mary 
gazed 
intently 
into 
his 
eyes 
with 
her 
own 
luminous 
ones
as 
he 
said 
this. 
She 
seemed 
to 
be 
trying 
to 
fathom 
the 
hidden 
meaning 
of
his 
words 
which 
would 
explain 
his 
feeling 
for 
her.

"Yes, 
yes," 
said 
she, 
"but 
you 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
regret 
the 
past, 
Count.
As 
I 
understand 
your 
present 
life, 
<a href="/cZl/JV5GaVr3hxx6Cv.html">I</a> 
think 
you 
will 
always 
recall 
it
with 
satisfaction, 
because 
the 
self-sacrifice 
that 
fills 
it 
now..."

"I 
<a href="/cZl/Kr3Q.html">cannot</a> 
accept 
your 
praise," 
he 
interrupted 
her 
hurriedly.<p>
"On 
the
contrary 
I 
continually 
reproach 
myself.... 
But 
this 
is 
not 
at 
all 
an
interesting 
or 
cheerful 
subject."

His 
face 
again 
resumed 
its 
former 
stiff
