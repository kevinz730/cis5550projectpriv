artilleryman, 
wiping 
away</h1>the 
blood 
with 
his 
coat 
sleeve, 
as 
if
apologizing 
for 
the 
state 
of 
his 
gun.

It 
was 
all 
that 
they 
could<p>
do 
to 
get 
the 
guns 
up 
the 
rise 
aided 
by 
the
infantry, 
and 
having 
reached 
the 
village 
of<p>
Gruntersdorf 
they 
halted. 
It
had 
grown 
so 
dark 
that 
one 
could 
not 
distinguish 
the 
uniforms 
ten 
paces
off, 
and 
the 
firing 
had 
begun 
to 
subside. 
Suddenly, 
near 
by 
on 
the
right, 
shouting 
and 
firing 
were 
again 
heard. 
Flashes 
of 
shot 
gleamed 
in
the 
darkness. 
This 
was 
the 
last 
French 
attack 
and 
was 
met 
by 
soldiers
who 
had 
sheltered 
in 
the 
village 
houses. 
They 
all 
rushed 
out 
of
the 
village 
again, 
but 
Tushin's 
guns 
could 
not 
move, 
and 
the
artillerymen, 
Tushin, 
and 
the 
cadet 
exchanged 
silent 
glances 
as 
they
awaited 
their 
fate. 
The 
firing 
died 
down 
and 
soldiers, 
talking<p>
eagerly,
streamed 
out 
of 
a 
side 
street.

"Not 
hurt, 
Petrov?" 
asked 
one.

"We've 
given 
it 
'em 
hot, 
mate! 
They 
won't 
make 
another 
push
now," 
said 
another.

"You 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UK9Z7Uo.html">couldn't</a> 
see 
a 
thing. 
How 
they 
shot 
at 
their 
own 
fellows!
Nothing 
could 
be 
seen. 
Pitch-dark, 
brother! 
Isn't 
there 
something 
to
drink?"

The 
French 
had 
been 
repulsed 
for 
the 
last 
time. 
And 
again 
and 
again 
in
the 
complete 
darkness 
Tushin's 
guns 
moved 
forward, 
surrounded 
by 
the
humming 
infantry 
as 
by 
a 
frame.

In 
the 
darkness, 
it 
seemed 
as 
though 
a 
gloomy 
unseen 
river 
was 
<a href="/cZl/oz7EXJo37NPT.html">flowing
always</a> 
in 
one 
direction, 
humming 
with 
whispers 
and 
talk 
and 
the 
sound 
of
hoofs 
and 
wheels. 
Amid 
the 
general 
rumble, 
the 
groans 
and 
voices 
of 
the
wounded 
were
