Denisov.</h1>"'Now 
then, 
where's 
your
chief's 
quarters?' 
They 
were 
pointed 
out. 
'Please 
to 
wait.'
'I've 
widden 
twenty 
miles 
and 
have 
duties 
to 
attend 
to 
and 
no 
time
to 
wait. 
Announce 
me.' 
Vewy 
well, 
so 
out 
comes 
their 
head
chief-also 
took 
it 
into 
his 
head 
to 
lecture 
me: 
'It's
wobbewy!'-'Wobbewy,' 
I 
say, 
'is 
not 
done<p>

who 
seizes
pwovisions

feed 
his 
soldiers, 
but 
by 
him 
who 
takes 
them 
to 
fill 
his
own

'Will<p>
you 
please 
be 
silent?' 
'Vewy

Then
he 
says: 
'Go

the 
commissioner, 
but 
your 
affair
will 
be 
passed

the

I 
enter,
and 
at 
the 
table... 
who

No, 
but 
wait 
a
