seriously.

"Yes, 
they 
have. 
Julie 
Drubetskaya 
told 
me 
so. 
I 
went 
to 
see 
them, 
but
missed 
them. 
They 
have 
gone 
to 
your 
estate

CHAPTER 
XXV

The 
officers 
were 
about 
to 
take 
leave, 
but 
Prince 
Andrew, 
apparently
reluctant 
to 
be 
left 
alone 
with 
his 
friend, 
asked 
them 
to 
stay 
and 
have
tea. 
Seats 
were 
brought 
in 
and 
so 
was 
the 
tea. 
The 
officers 
gazed 
with
surprise 
at 
Pierre's 
huge 
stout 
figure 
and 
listened 
to 
his 
talk 
of
Moscow 
and 
the 
position 
of 
our 
army, 
round 
which 
he 
had 
ridden. 
Prince
Andrew 
remained 
silent, 
and 
his 
expression<p>
was 
so 
forbidding 
that 
Pierre
addressed 
his 
remarks 
chiefly 
to 
the 
good-natured 
battalion 
commander.

"So 
you 
understand 
the 
whole 
position 
<a href="/aVzUge/NhF3gdRt8E.html">of</a> 
our 
troops?" 
Prince 
Andrew
interrupted 
him.

"Yes-that 
is, 
how 
do 
you 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tHL2iU9hxx7.html">mean?"</a> 
said 
Pierre. 
"Not 
being 
a 
military 
man
I 
can't 
say 
I 
have 
understood 
it 
fully, 
but 
I 
understand 
the 
general
position."

"Well, 
then, 
you 
know 
more 
than 
anyone<p>
else, 
be 
it 
who 
it 
may," 
said
Prince 
Andrew.

"Oh!" 
said 
Pierre, 
looking 
over 
his 
spectacles 
in 
perplexity 
at 
Prince
Andrew. 
"Well, 
and 
what 
do 
you 
think 
of 
Kutuzov's 
appointment?" 
he
asked.

"I 
was 
very 
glad 
of 
his 
appointment, 
that's 
all 
I 
know," 
replied 
Prince
Andrew.

"And 
tell 
me 
your 
opinion 
of 
Barclay 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Xs7HAb8Wu7IQlv.html">de</a> 
Tolly. 
<a href="/aVzUge/Wq6bvg28.html">In</a> 
Moscow 
they 
are 
saying
heaven 
knows 
what 
about 
him.... 
What 
do 
you 
think 
of 
him?"

"Ask 
them," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew, 
indicating 
the 
officers.
