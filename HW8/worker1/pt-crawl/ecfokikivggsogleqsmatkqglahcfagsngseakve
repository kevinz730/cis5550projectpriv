The
old 
prince 
understood 
from 
this 
official 
report 
that 
our 
army 
had 
been
defeated. 
A 
week 
after 
the 
gazette 
report 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Austerlitz
came 
a 
letter 
from 
Kutuzov 
informing<p>
the 
prince 
of 
the 
fate 
that 
had
befallen 
his 
son.

"Your 
son," 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/FKL39t5zvJ.html">wrote</a> 
Kutuzov, 
"fell 
before 
my 
eyes, 
a 
standard 
in
his 
hand 
and 
at 
the 
head 
of 
a 
regiment-he 
fell 
as 
a 
hero, 
worthy 
of
his 
father 
and 
his 
fatherland. 
To 
the 
great 
regret 
of 
myself 
and 
of<p>
the
whole 
army 
it 
<a href="/aVzUge/SO90O9PUEsy.html">is</a> 
still 
uncertain 
whether 
he 
is 
alive<p>
or 
not. 
I 
comfort
myself 
and 
you 
with 
the 
hope 
that 
your 
son 
is 
alive, 
for 
otherwise
he 
would 
have 
been 
mentioned 
among 
the 
officers 
found<p>
on 
the 
field<p>
of
battle, 
a 
list 
of 
whom 
<a href="/aVzUge/NRO377NPl.html">has</a> 
been 
sent 
me 
under 
flag 
of 
truce."

After 
receiving 
this 
news 
late 
in 
the 
evening, 
when 
he 
was 
alone 
in 
his
study, 
the 
old 
prince 
went 
for 
his 
walk 
as 
usual 
next 
morning, 
but 
he
was 
silent 
with 
his 
steward, 
the 
gardener, 
and 
the 
architect, 
and 
though
he 
looked 
very 
grim 
he 
said 
nothing 
to 
anyone.

When 
Princess 
Mary 
went 
to 
him 
at 
the 
usual<p>
hour 
he 
was 
working 
at 
his
lathe 
and, 
as 
usual, 
did 
not 
look 
round 
at 
her.

"Ah, 
Princess 
Mary!" 
he 
said 
suddenly 
in 
an 
unnatural 
voice,
throwing 
down 
his 
chisel. 
(The 
wheel 
continued 
to 
revolve 
by 
its 
own
impetus, 
and 
Princess 
Mary 
long 
remembered 
the 
dying 
creak 
of 
that
wheel, 
which 
merged 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ex5AyyZE1suDcq7kQqNG.html">in</a> 
her 
memory 
with 
what 
followed.)

She 
approached 
him, 
saw 
his 
face, 
and 
something 
gave 
way 
within 
her. 
Her
eyes 
grew 
dim. 
By 
the 
expression 
of 
her 
father's 
face, 
not 
sad, 
not
crushed, 
but 
angry 
and 
working 
unnaturally, 
she 
saw 
that 
hanging 
over
her 
and 
about 
to 
crush 
her 
was 
some 
terrible 
misfortune,
