he 
had 
seen<p>
and
understood, 
that 
he 
could 
not 
answer 
him.

Everything 
seemed 
so 
futile 
and 
insignificant 
in 
comparison 
with 
the
stern 
and 
solemn 
train 
of 
thought 
that 
weakness 
from 
loss 
of 
blood,
suffering, 
and 
the 
nearness 
of 
death 
aroused 
in 
him. 
Looking 
into
Napoleon's 
eyes 
Prince 
Andrew 
thought 
of 
the 
insignificance 
of
greatness, 
the 
unimportance 
of 
life 
which 
no 
one 
could 
understand, 
and
the 
still 
greater 
unimportance 
of 
death, 
the 
meaning 
of 
which 
no 
one
alive 
could 
understand 
or 
explain.

The 
Emperor 
without 
waiting 
for 
an 
answer 
turned 
away 
and 
said 
to 
one 
of
the 
officers 
as 
he 
went: 
"Have 
these 
gentlemen 
attended 
to 
and 
taken
to 
my 
bivouac; 
let 
my 
doctor, 
Larrey, 
examine 
their 
wounds. 
Au 
revoir,
Prince 
Repnin!" 
and 
he 
spurred 
his 
horse 
and 
galloped 
away.

His 
face 
shone 
with 
self-satisfaction 
and 
pleasure.

The 
soldiers 
who 
had 
carried 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
noticed 
and 
taken 
the
little 
gold 
icon 
Princess 
Mary 
had 
hung 
round 
her 
brother's 
neck, 
but
seeing 
the 
favor 
the 
Emperor 
showed 
the 
prisoners, 
they 
now 
hastened 
to
return 
the 
holy 
image.

Prince 
Andrew 
did 
not 
see 
how 
and 
by 
whom 
it 
was 
replaced, 
but 
the
little 
icon 
with 
its 
thin 
gold 
chain 
suddenly 
appeared 
upon 
his 
chest
outside 
his 
uniform.

"It 
would 
be 
good," 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
glancing 
at 
the 
icon 
his
sister 
had 
hung<p>
round 
his 
neck 
with<p>
such 
emotion 
and 
reverence, 
"it
would 
be 
good 
if 
everything 
were 
<a href="/cZl/kW5XT8UHdX0aJoR.html">as</a> 
clear 
and 
simple 
as 
it 
seems 
to
Mary. 
How 
good 
it 
would 
be 
to 
know 
where 
to 
seek 
for 
help 
in 
this 
life,
and 
what 
to 
expect 
after 
it 
beyond 
the 
grave! 
How 
happy 
and<p>
calm 
I
should 
be 
if 
I 
could 
now 
say: 
'Lord, 
have 
mercy 
on 
me!'... 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/iU2tHdfO2Qqw7.html">But</a> 
to
whom 
should 
I 
say 
that? 
Either 
to 
a 
Power 
indefinable, 
incomprehensible,
which 
I 
not 
only 
cannot 
address 
but 
which 
I 
cannot 
even 
express 
in
words-the 
Great 
All 
or 
Nothing-" 
said 
he 
to 
himself, 
"or 
to
that 
God 
who 
has 
been 
sewn 
into 
this 
amulet 
by 
Mary! 
There 
is 
nothing
certain, 
nothing 
at 
all 
except 
the 
unimportance 
of 
everything 
I
understand, 
and 
the 
greatness 
of 
something 
incomprehensible 
but
all-important."

The 
stretchers 
moved 
on. 
At 
every 
jolt 
he 
again 
felt 
unendurable 
pain;
his 
feverishness 
increased 
and 
he 
grew 
delirious. 
Visions 
of 
his 
father,
wife, 
sister, 
and 
future 
son, 
and 
the 
tenderness 
he 
had 
felt 
the 
night
before 
the 
battle, 
the 
figure 
of 
the 
insignificant 
little 
Napoleon, 
and
above 
all 
this 
the 
lofty 
sky, 
formed 
the 
chief 
subjects 
of 
his 
delirious
fancies.

The 
quiet 
home 
life 
and 
peaceful 
happiness 
of 
Bald 
Hills 
presented
itself 
to 
him. 
He 
was 
already 
enjoying
