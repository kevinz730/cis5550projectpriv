"Peter 
Kirilovich, 
come 
here! 
We 
have 
recognized 
you! 
This 
is
wonderful!" 
she 
cried, 
holding 
out 
her 
hand 
to 
him. 
"What 
are 
you 
doing?
Why 
are 
you 
like 
this?"

Pierre 
took 
her 
outstretched 
hand 
and 
kissed 
it 
awkwardly 
as 
he 
walked
along 
beside 
her 
while 
the 
coach 
still 
moved 
on.

"What<p>
is 
the 
matter, 
Count?" 
asked 
the 
countess 
in 
a 
surprised 
and
commiserating 
tone.

"What? 
What? 
Why? 
Don't 
ask 
<a href="/cZl/vo7Ptam9uIRD1v.html">me,"</a> 
said 
Pierre, 
and 
looked 
round 
at
Natasha 
whose 
radiant, 
happy 
expression-of 
which 
he 
was 
conscious
without 
looking 
at 
her-filled 
him 
with 
enchantment.

"Are 
you 
remaining 
in 
Moscow, 
then?"

Pierre 
hesitated.

"In 
Moscow?" 
he 
said 
in 
a 
questioning 
tone. 
"Yes, 
in 
Moscow. 
Good-by!"

"Ah, 
if 
only 
I 
were 
a 
man! 
I'd 
certainly 
stay 
with 
you. 
How 
splendid!"
said 
Natasha. 
"Mamma, 
if 
you'll 
let 
me, 
<a href="/aVzUge/yG8p.html">I'll</a> 
stay!"

Pierre 
glanced 
absently 
at 
Natasha 
and 
was 
about 
to 
say 
something, 
but
the 
countess 
interrupted 
him.

"You 
were 
at 
the 
battle, 
we 
heard."

"Yes, 
I 
was," 
Pierre 
answered. 
"There 
will 
be 
another 
battle
tomorrow..." 
he 
began, 
but 
Natasha 
interrupted 
him.

"But<p>
what 
is 
the 
matter 
with 
you, 
Count? 
You 
are 
not

yourself...."

"Oh, 
don't 
ask 
me, 
don't 
ask 
me! 
I 
don't

myself. 
Tomorrow... 
But
no! 
Good-by, 
good-by!" 
he 
muttered. 
"It's 
an 
awful 
time!" 
and 
dropping
behind 
the 
carriage 
he 
stepped 
onto 
the 
pavement.

Natasha 
continued 
to 
lean 
out 
of 
the 
window 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
beaming

her

slightly 
quizzical, 
happy 
smile.





CHAPTER 
XVIII

For 
the 
last 
two 
days, 
ever 
since 
leaving 
home, 
Pierre 
had 
been 
living
in 
the 
empty 
house 
of 
his 
deceased 
benefactor, 
Bazdeev. 
This 
is 
how 
it
happened.

When 
he 
woke 
up 
on 
the 
morning 
after 
his 
return 
to 
Moscow 
and 
his
interview 
with 
Count 
Rostopchin, 
he 
could 
not 
for 
some 
time 
make 
out
where 
he 
was 
and 
what 
was 
expected 
of 
him. 
When 
he 
was 
informed 
that
among 
others 
awaiting 
him 
in 
his 
reception 
room 
<a href="/aVzUge/suD4UHdX4suDcq6GBhrH.html">there</a> 
was 
a 
Frenchman
who 
had 
brought 
a 
letter 
from 
his 
wife, 
the 
Countess 
Helene, 
he 
felt
suddenly 
overcome 
by 
that 
sense 
of 
confusion 
and 
hopelessness 
to 
which
he 
was 
apt 
to 
succumb. 
He 
felt 
that 
everything 
was 
now 
at 
an 
end, 
all
was 
in 
confusion 
and 
crumbling 
to 
pieces, 
that 
nobody 
was 
right 
or
wrong, 
the 
future 
held 
nothing, 
and 
there 
was 
no 
escape 
from 
this
position. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NY9D9lLv5g.html">Smiling</a> 
unnaturally 
and 
muttering 
to 
himself, 
he 
first 
sat
down 
on 
the 
sofa 
in 
an 
attitude 
of 
despair, 
then 
rose, 
went 
to 
the 
door
of 
the 
reception 
room 
and 
peeped 
through 
the 
crack, 
returned 
flourishing
his 
arms, 
and 
took 
up 
a 
book. 
His 
major-domo 
came 
in 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mS2fY5hQrxS8OgAj.html">a</a> 
second 
time 
to
say 
that 
the 
Frenchman 
who 
had 
brought 
the 
letter 
from 
the 
countess
was 
very 
anxious 
to 
see 
him 
if 
only 
for 
a 
minute, 
and 
that 
someone 
from
Bazdeev's 
widow 
had 
called 
to 
ask 
Pierre 
to 
take<p>
charge 
of 
her 
husband's
books, 
as 
she 
herself 
was 
leaving 
for 
the 
country.

"Oh, 
yes, 
in 
a 
minute; 
wait... 
or 
no! 
No, 
of 
course... 
go 
and 
say 
I 
will
come 
directly," 
Pierre 
replied 
to 
the 
major-domo.

But 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
man 
had 
left 
the 
room 
Pierre 
took 
up 
his 
hat 
which
was 
lying 
on 
the 
table 
and 
went 
out 
of 
his 
study 
by 
the 
other 
door.
There 
was 
no 
one 
in 
the 
passage. 
He 
went 
along 
the 
whole 
length 
of 
this
passage 
to 
the 
stairs 
and, 
frowning 
and 
rubbing 
his 
forehead 
with
both 
hands, 
went 
down 
as 
far 
as 
the 
first 
landing. 
The 
hall 
porter 
was
standing 
at 
the 
front 
door. 
From 
the 
landing 
where 
Pierre 
stood<p>
there
was 
a 
second 
staircase 
leading 
to 
the 
back 
entrance. 
He 
went 
down 
that
staircase 
and 
out 
into 
the 
yard. 
No 
one 
had 
seen 
him. 
But 
there 
were
some 
carriages 
waiting, 
and 
as 
soon 
as 
Pierre 
stepped<p>
out 
of 
the 
gate
the 
coachmen
