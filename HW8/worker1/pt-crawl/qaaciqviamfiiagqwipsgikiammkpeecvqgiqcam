principles 
laid 
down 
by</h1>me 
must 
be 
strictly
adhered 
to," 
said 
he, 
drumming 
on 
the 
table<p>
with 
his 
bony 
fingers. 
"What
is 
the 
difficulty? 
Nonsense, 
childishness!"

He 
went 
up 
to 
the 
map 
and 
speaking 
rapidly 
began 
proving 
that 
no
eventuality 
could 
alter 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
Drissa 
camp, 
that
everything 
had 
been 
foreseen, 
and 
that 
if 
the 
enemy 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cm7bI42GaVr.html">were</a> 
really 
going 
to
outflank 
it, 
the 
enemy 
would 
inevitably 
be 
destroyed.

Paulucci, 
who 
did 
not 
know 
German, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/JM10WMYlo2A.html">began</a> 
questioning 
him 
in<p>
French.
Wolzogen 
came 
to 
the 
assistance 
of 
his 
chief, 
who 
spoke 
French 
badly,
and 
began 
translating 
for 
him, 
hardly 
able 
to 
keep 
pace 
with 
Pfuel, 
who
was 
rapidly 
demonstrating 
that 
not 
only 
all 
that 
had 
happened, 
but 
all
that 
could 
happen, 
had 
been 
foreseen 
in 
his 
scheme, 
and 
that 
if 
there
were 
now 
any 
difficulties 
the 
whole 
fault 
lay 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
his 
plan
had 
not 
been 
precisely 
executed. 
He 
kept 
laughing 
sarcastically, 
he
demonstrated, 
and 
at 
last 
contemptuously 
ceased 
to 
demonstrate, 
like
a 
mathematician 
who 
ceases 
to 
prove 
in 
various 
ways 
<a href="/aVzUge/Lu1l51UVJhk.html">the</a> 
accuracy 
of
a 
problem 
that 
has 
already 
been 
proved. 
Wolzogen 
took 
his 
place 
and
continued 
to 
explain 
his 
views 
in 
French, 
every<p>
now 
and 
then 
<a href="/cZl/Bh2bI7WG6DbPtL.html">turning</a> 
to
Pfuel 
and 
saying, 
"Is 
it 
not 
so, 
your 
excellency?" 
But 
Pfuel, 
like 
a 
man
heated 
in 
a 
fight 
who 
strikes 
those 
on 
his 
own 
side, 
shouted 
angrily 
at
his<p>
own 
supporter, 
Wolzogen:

"Well, 
of 
course, 
what 
more 
is 
there 
to 
explain?"

Paulucci 
and 
Michaud 
both 
attacked 
Wolzogen 
<a href="/cZl/IE2S0T.html">simultaneously</a> 
in 
French.
Armfeldt 
addressed 
Pfuel 
in 
German. 
Toll 
explained 
to 
Volkonski 
in
Russian. 
Prince 
Andrew 
listened 
and 
observed 
in 
silence.

Of 
all 
these 
men 
Prince 
Andrew 
sympathized 
most 
with 
Pfuel, 
angry,
determined, 
and 
absurdly 
self-confident 
as 
he 
was. 
Of 
all 
those 
present,
evidently 
he 
alone 
was 
not 
seeking 
anything 
for 
himself, 
nursed 
no
hatred 
against 
anyone, 
and 
only 
desired 
that 
the 
plan,
