had 
attended, 
and 
to
invitations 
he 
had 
received 
from 
N.N. 
and 
S.S.

All 
this 
time 
Natasha 
sat 
silent, 
glancing 
up 
at 
him 
from 
under 
her
brows. 
This 
gaze 
disturbed 
and 
confused 
Boris 
more 
and 
more. 
He 
looked
round 
more 
frequently 
toward 
her, 
and 
broke 
off 
in 
what 
he 
was 
saying.
He 
did 
not 
stay 
more 
than 
ten 
minutes, 
then 
rose 
and 
took 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/gv8sCi8PFi5qB.html">his</a> 
leave. 
The
same 
inquisitive, 
challenging, 
and 
rather 
mocking 
eyes 
still 
looked
at 
him. 
After 
his 
first 
visit 
Boris 
said 
to 
himself 
that 
Natasha
attracted 
him 
just 
as 
much 
as 
ever, 
but 
that 
he 
must 
not 
yield 
to 
that
feeling, 
because 
to 
marry 
her, 
a 
girl 
almost 
without 
fortune, 
would
mean 
ruin 
to 
his 
career, 
while 
to 
renew 
their 
former 
relations 
without
intending 
to 
marry 
her 
would 
be<p>
dishonorable. 
Boris 
made 
up 
his 
mind
to 
avoid 
meeting 
Natasha, 
but 
despite 
that 
resolution 
he 
called 
again
a 
few 
days 
later 
and 
began 
calling 
often 
and 
spending 
whole 
days 
at 
the
Rostovs'. 
It 
seemed 
to 
him 
that 
he 
ought 
to 
have 
an 
explanation 
with
Natasha 
and 
tell 
her 
that 
the 
old 
times 
must 
be 
forgotten, 
that 
in
spite 
of 
everything... 
she 
could 
not 
be 
his 
wife, 
that 
he 
had 
no 
means,
and 
they 
would 
never 
let 
her 
marry 
him. 
But 
he 
failed 
to 
do 
so 
and 
felt
awkward 
about 
entering 
on 
such 
an 
explanation.<p>
From 
day 
to 
day 
he
became 
more 
and 
more 
entangled. 
It 
seemed 
to 
her 
mother 
and 
Sonya 
that
Natasha 
was 
in 
love 
with 
Boris 
as 
of 
old. 
She 
sang 
him 
his 
favorite
songs, 
showed 
him 
her 
album, 
making 
him 
write 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UZ7GaVr7XZEHJ3bzE.html">in</a> 
it, 
did 
not 
allow 
him
to 
allude 
to 
the 
past, 
letting<p>
<a href="/cZl/Lx2eI3.html">it</a> 
be 
understood 
how 
delightful 
was 
the
present; 
and 
every 
day 
he 
went 
away 
in 
a 
fog, 
without 
having 
said 
what
he 
meant 
to, 
and 
not 
knowing 
what 
he 
was 
doing 
or 
why 
he 
came, 
or 
how
it 
would 
all 
end. 
He 
left 
off 
visiting 
Helene 
and 
received 
reproachful
notes 
from 
her 
every 
day, 
and 
yet 
he 
continued
