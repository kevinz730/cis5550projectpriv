With 
regard 
to 
supplies 
for 
the 
army, 
Napoleon 
decreed 
that 
all 
the
troops 
in 
turn 
should 
enter 
Moscow 
a 
la 
maraude 
* 
to 
obtain 
provisions
for 
themselves, 
so 
that 
the 
army 
might 
have 
its 
future 
provided 
for.

With 
regard 
to 
religion, 
Napoleon 
ordered 
the 
priests 
to 
be 
brought 
back
and 
services 
to 
be 
again 
performed 
in 
the 
churches.

With 
regard 
to 
commerce 
and 
to 
provisioning 
the 
army, 
the 
following 
was
placarded 
everywhere:

PROCLAMATION

You, 
peaceful 
inhabitants 
of 
Moscow, 
artisans 
and 
workmen 
whom
misfortune 
has 
driven 
from 
the<p>
city, 
and 
you 
scattered 
tillers 
of
the 
soil, 
still 
kept 
out 
in 
the 
fields 
by 
groundless 
fear, 
listen!
Tranquillity 
is 
returning 
to 
this 
capital 
and 
order 
is 
being 
restored 
in
it. 
Your 
fellow 
countrymen 
are 
emerging 
boldly 
from 
their 
hiding 
places
on 
finding 
that 
they 
are 
respected. 
Any 
violence 
to 
them 
or 
to 
their
property 
is 
promptly 
punished. 
His 
Majesty 
the 
Emperor 
and 
King 
protects
them, 
and 
considers 
no 
one 
among 
you 
his 
enemy 
except 
those 
who 
disobey
his 
orders. 
He 
desires 
to 
end 
your 
misfortunes 
and 
restore 
you 
to 
your
homes 
and 
families. 
Respond, 
therefore, 
to 
his 
benevolent 
intentions
and 
come 
to 
us 
without 
fear. 
Inhabitants, 
return 
with 
confidence 
to 
your
abodes! 
You 
will 
soon 
find 
means 
of 
satisfying 
your 
needs. 
Craftsmen
and 
industrious 
artisans, 
return 
to 
your 
work, 
your 
houses, 
your 
shops,
where 
the 
protection 
of 
guards 
awaits 
you! 
You 
shall 
receive 
proper 
pay
for 
your 
work. 
And 
lastly<p>
you 
too, 
peasants, 
come 
from 
the 
forests 
where
you 
are 
hiding 
in 
terror, 
return 
to 
your 
huts 
without 
fear, 
in 
full
assurance 
that 
you 
will 
find 
protection! 
Markets 
are 
established 
in 
the
city 
where<p>
peasants 
can 
bring 
their 
surplus 
supplies 
and 
the 
products 
of
the 
soil. 
The 
government 
has 
taken<p>
the 
following 
steps 
to 
ensure 
freedom
of 
sale 
for 
them: 
(1) 
From 
today, 
peasants, 
husbandmen, 
and 
those
living 
in 
the 
neighborhood 
of 
Moscow 
may 
without 
any 
danger 
bring 
their
supplies 
of 
all 
kinds 
to 
two 
appointed 
markets, 
of 
which 
one 
is 
on
the 
Mokhovaya 
Street 
and 
the 
other 
at 
the 
Provision 
Market. 
(2) 
Such
supplies 
will 
be 
bought 
from 
them 
at 
such 
prices 
as 
seller 
and 
buyer 
may
agree 
on, 
and 
if 
a 
seller 
is 
unable 
to 
obtain 
a 
fair 
price 
he 
will 
be
free 
to 
take 
his 
goods 
back 
to 
his 
village 
and 
no 
one 
may 
hinder 
him
under 
any 
pretense. 
(3) 
Sunday 
and 
Wednesday 
of 
each 
week 
are 
appointed
as 
the 
chief 
market 
days 
and 
to 
that 
end 
a 
sufficient 
number 
of 
troops
will 
be 
stationed 
along 
the 
highroads 
on 
Tuesdays 
and 
Saturdays 
at 
such
distances 
from 
the 
town 
as 
to 
protect 
the 
carts. 
(4) 
Similar 
measures
will 
be 
taken 
that 
peasants 
with 
their 
carts 
and 
horses 
may 
meet 
with 
no
hindrance 
on 
their 
return 
journey. 
(5) 
Steps 
will 
immediately 
be 
taken
to 
re-establish 
ordinary 
trading.

Inhabitants 
of 
the 
city 
and 
villages, 
and 
you, 
workingmen 
and 
artisans,
to 
whatever 
nation 
you 
belong, 
you 
are 
called 
on 
to 
carry 
out 
the
paternal 
intentions 
of 
His 
Majesty 
the 
Emperor 
and 
King 
and 
to
co-operate 
with 
him 
for 
the 
public 
welfare! 
Lay 
your 
respect 
and
confidence 
at 
his 
feet 
and 
do 
not 
delay 
to 
unite 
with 
us!


With 
the 
object 
of 
raising 
the 
spirits 
of 
the 
troops 
and 
of 
the 
people,
reviews 
were 
constantly 
held 
and 
rewards<p>
distributed. 
The 
Emperor
rode 
through 
the 
streets 
to 
comfort 
the 
inhabitants, 
and, 
despite 
his
preoccupation 
with 
state 
affairs, 
himself<p>
visited 
the 
theaters 
that 
were
established 
by 
his 
order.

In 
regard 
to 
philanthropy, 
the 
greatest 
virtue 
of 
crowned
