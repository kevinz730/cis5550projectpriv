Here, 
in 
the 
regiment, 
all 
was 
clear 
and
simple. 
The 
<a href="/aVzUge/BA7QSaz1alHv5yxsz.html">whole</a> 
world 
was 
divided 
into 
two 
unequal 
parts: 
one, 
our
Pavlograd 
regiment; 
the 
other, 
all 
the 
rest. 
And 
the 
rest 
was 
no
concern 
of 
his. 
In 
the 
regiment, 
everything 
was 
definite: 
who 
was
lieutenant, 
who 
captain, 
who 
was 
a 
good 
fellow, 
who 
a 
bad 
one, 
and 
most
of 
all, 
who 
was 
a 
comrade. 
The 
canteenkeeper 
gave 
one

had 
only 
to 
do 
nothing 
that 
was 
considered 
bad 
in 
the 
Pavlograd
regiment 
and, 
when 
given 
an 
order, 
to 
do 
what 
was 
clearly, 
distinctly,
and 
definitely 
ordered-and 
all 
would 
be 
well.

Having 
once 
more 
entered 
into 
the 
definite 
conditions 
of 
this 
regimental
life, 
Rostov 
felt 
the 
joy 
and 
relief 
a 
tired 
man 
feels 
on 
lying 
down 
to
rest.

in 
the
