through 
the 
sticky 
mud 
that 
covered 
the 
planks 
of 
the
bridge. 
Sometimes 
through 
the 
monotonous 
waves 
of 
men, 
like 
a 
fleck 
of
white 
foam 
on 
the 
waves 
of 
the 
Enns, 
an 
officer, 
in 
a 
cloak 
and 
with
a 
type 
of 
face 
different 
from 
that 
of 
the 
men, 
squeezed 
his 
way 
along;
sometimes 
like 
a 
chip 
of 
wood 
whirling 
in 
the 
river,<p>
an 
hussar 
on 
foot,
an 
orderly, 
or 
a 
townsman 
was 
carried 
through 
the 
waves 
of 
infantry;
and 
sometimes 
like 
a 
log 
floating 
down 
the 
river, 
an 
officers' 
or
company's 
baggage 
wagon, 
piled 
high, 
leather 
covered, 
and 
hemmed 
in 
on
all 
sides, 
moved 
across 
the 
bridge.

"It's 
as 
if 
a 
dam 
had 
burst," 
said 
the 
Cossack 
hopelessly. 
"Are
there 
many 
more 
of 
you 
to 
come?"

"A 
million 
all 
but 
one!" 
replied<p>
a 
waggish 
soldier 
in 
a 
torn 
coat,
with 
a 
wink, 
and 
passed 
on 
followed 
by 
another, 
an 
old 
man.

"If 
he" 
(he 
meant 
the 
enemy) 
"begins 
popping 
at 
the 
bridge<p>
now,"
said 
the 
old 
soldier 
dismally 
to 
a 
comrade, 
"you'll 
forget 
to
scratch 
yourself."

That 
soldier 
passed 
on, 
and 
after 
him 
came 
another 
sitting 
on 
a 
cart.

"Where 
the 
devil 
have 
the 
leg 
bands 
been 
shoved 
to?" 
said 
an
orderly, 
running 
behind 
the 
cart 
and 
fumbling 
in 
the 
back 
of 
it.

And 
he 
also 
passed 
on 
with 
the 
wagon. 
Then 
came 
some 
merry 
soldiers 
who
had 
evidently 
been 
drinking.

"And 
then, 
old 
fellow, 
he 
gives 
him 
one 
in 
the 
teeth 
with 
the 
butt
end 
of 
his 
gun..." 
a 
soldier 
whose 
greatcoat 
was 
well 
tucked 
up 
said
gaily, 
with 
a 
wide 
swing 
of 
his 
arm.

"Yes, 
the 
ham 
was 
just 
delicious..." 
answered 
another 
with 
a 
loud
laugh. 
And 
they, 
too, 
passed 
on, 
so 
that 
Nesvitski 
did 
not 
learn 
who
had 
been 
struck 
on 
the 
teeth, 
or 
what 
the 
ham 
had 
to 
do 
with 
it.

"Bah! 
How 
they 
scurry. 
He 
just 
sends 
a 
ball 
and 
they 
think 
they'll
all 
be 
killed," 
a 
sergeant 
was 
saying 
angrily 
and 
reproachfully.

"As 
it 
flies 
past 
me, 
Daddy, 
the 
ball 
I 
mean," 
said 
a 
young 
soldier
with 
an 
enormous 
mouth, 
hardly 
refraining 
from 
laughing, 
"I 
felt 
like
dying 
of 
fright. 
I 
did, 
'pon 
my 
word, 
I 
got 
that 
frightened!" 
said
he, 
as 
if 
bragging 
of 
having 
been 
frightened.

That 
one 
also 
passed. 
Then 
followed 
a 
cart 
unlike 
any 
that 
had 
gone
before. 
It 
was 
a 
German 
cart 
with 
a 
pair 
of 
horses 
led 
by 
a 
German, 
and
seemed 
loaded 
with 
a 
whole 
houseful 
of 
effects. 
A 
fine 
brindled 
cow 
with
a 
large 
udder 
was 
attached 
to 
the 
cart 
behind. 
A 
woman 
with 
an 
unweaned
baby, 
an 
old 
woman, 
and 
a 
healthy 
German 
girl 
with 
bright 
red 
cheeks
were 
sitting 
on
