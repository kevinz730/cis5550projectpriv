of 
what 
she 
was 
doing 
began 
shouting 
in 
angry
haste 
at 
the 
Frenchwoman, 
her 
voice 
breaking: 
"It's 
horrible, 
vile,
inhuman, 
to 
take 
advantage 
of<p>
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZN11tHdfO4ZS.html">weakness..."</a> 
She 
did 
not 
finish.
"Leave 
my 
room," 
she 
exclaimed, 
and 
burst 
into 
sobs.

Next 
day 
the 
prince 
did 
not 
say 
a 
word 
to 
his 
daughter, 
but 
she 
noticed
that 
at 
dinner 
he 
gave 
orders 
that 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
should 
be
served 
first. 
After 
dinner, 
when 
the 
footman 
handed 
coffee 
and 
from
habit 
began 
with 
the 
princess, 
the 
prince 
suddenly 
grew 
furious,
threw 
his 
stick 
at 
Philip, 
and 
instantly 
gave 
instructions 
to 
have 
him
conscripted 
for 
the 
army.

"He 
doesn't 
obey... 
I 
said 
it 
twice... 
and 
he 
doesn't 
obey! 
She
is 
the 
first 
person 
in 
this 
house; 
she's 
my 
best 
friend," 
cried
the 
prince. 
"And 
if 
you 
allow 
yourself," 
he 
screamed 
in 
a 
fury,
addressing 
Princess 
Mary 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
"to 
forget 
yourself 
again
before 
her 
as 
you 
dared 
to 
do 
yesterday, 
I 
will 
show 
you 
who 
is 
master
in 
this 
house. 
Go! 
Don't 
let 
me 
set 
eyes 
on 
you; 
beg 
her 
pardon!"

Princess 
Mary 
asked 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne's 
pardon, 
and 
also 
her
father's 
pardon 
for 
herself 
and 
for 
Philip 
the 
footman, 
who 
had 
begged
for 
her 
intervention.

At 
such 
moments 
something 
like 
a 
pride 
of 
sacrifice 
gathered 
in 
her
soul. 
And 
suddenly 
that 
father 
whom 
she 
had 
judged 
would 
look 
for 
his
spectacles 
in 
her 
presence, 
fumbling 
near 
them 
and 
not 
seeing 
them, 
or
would 
forget 
something 
that 
had 
just 
occurred, 
or 
take 
a 
false 
step 
with
his 
failing 
legs 
and 
turn 
to 
see 
if 
anyone 
had 
noticed 
his 
feebleness,
or, 
worst 
of 
all, 
at 
dinner 
when 
there 
were 
no 
visitors 
to 
excite 
him
would 
suddenly 
fall 
asleep, 
letting 
his 
napkin 
drop 
and 
his 
shaking
head 
sink 
over 
his 
plate. 
"He 
is 
old 
and 
feeble, 
and 
I 
dare 
to 
condemn
him!" 
she 
thought 
at 
such 
moments, 
with 
a 
feeling 
of 
revulsion 
against
herself.





CHAPTER 
III

In 
1811<p>
there 
was 
living 
in 
Moscow 
a 
French 
doctor-Metivier-who 
had
rapidly 
become 
the 
fashion. 
He 
was 
enormously 
tall, 
handsome, 
amiable
as 
Frenchmen 
are, 
and 
was, 
as 
all 
Moscow 
said, 
an 
extraordinarily 
clever
doctor. 
He 
was 
received 
in 
the 
best 
houses 
not 
merely 
as 
a 
doctor, 
but
as 
an 
equal.

Prince 
Nicholas 
had 
always 
ridiculed 
medicine, 
but 
latterly 
on
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne's 
advice 
had 
allowed 
this 
doctor 
to 
visit 
him
and 
had 
grown 
accustomed 
to 
him. 
Metivier 
came 
to 
see<p>
the 
prince 
about
twice 
a 
week.

On 
December 
6-St. 
Nicholas' 
Day 
and 
the 
prince's 
name 
day-all
Moscow 
came 
to 
the 
prince's
