they 
might 
be. 
Whether 
it 
was 
the
teacher's 
fault 
or 
the 
pupil's, 
this 
same 
thing 
happened 
every 
day:
the 
princess' 
eyes 
grew 
dim, 
she 
could 
not 
see 
and 
could 
not 
hear
anything, 
but 
was 
only 
<a href="/cZl/hK9It2AJH8Ztx.html">conscious</a> 
of 
her<p>
stern 
father's 
withered 
face
close 
to 
her, 
of 
his 
breath 
and 
the 
smell 
of 
him, 
and 
could 
think 
only
of 
how 
to 
get 
away 
quickly 
to 
her 
own 
room 
to 
make 
out 
the 
problem 
in
peace. 
The 
old 
man 
was 
beside 
himself: 
moved 
the 
chair 
on 
which 
he 
was
sitting 
noisily 
backward 
and 
forward, 
made 
efforts 
to 
control 
himself
and 
not 
become 
vehement, 
but 
almost 
always 
<a href="/cZl/Wa5iPTJ71oqw.html">did</a> 
become 
vehement, 
scolded,
and 
sometimes 
flung 
the 
exercise 
book 
away.

The 
princess 
gave 
a 
wrong 
answer.

"Well 
now, 
isn't 
she 
a 
fool!" 
shouted 
the 
prince, 
pushing 
the 
book
aside 
and 
turning 
sharply 
away; 
but 
rising 
immediately, 
he 
paced 
up 
and
down, 
lightly 
touched 
his 
daughter's 
hair 
and 
sat 
down 
again.

He 
drew 
up 
his 
chair, 
and 
continued 
to 
explain.

"This 
won't 
do, 
Princess; 
it 
won't 
do," 
said 
he, 
when 
Princess
Mary, 
having 
taken 
and 
closed 
the 
exercise 
book 
with 
the 
next 
day's
lesson, 
was 
about 
to 
leave: 
"Mathematics 
are 
most 
important, 
madam!
I 
don't 
want 
to 
<a href="/aVzUge/kp76v8dkSm.html">have</a> 
you 
like 
our 
silly 
ladies. 
Get 
used 
to 
it 
and
you'll 
like 
it," 
and 
he 
patted 
her 
cheek. 
"It 
will 
drive 
all 
the
nonsense 
out 
of 
your 
head."

She 
turned 
to 
go, 
but 
he 
stopped 
her 
with 
a 
gesture 
and 
took 
an 
uncut
book 
from 
the 
high 
desk.

"Here 
is 
some 
sort 
of 
Key 
to 
the 
Mysteries 
that 
your 
Heloise 
has
sent 
you. 
Religious! 
I 
don't 
interfere 
with 
anyone's 
belief... 
I
have 
looked 
at 
it. 
Take 
it. 
Well, 
now 
go. 
Go."

He 
patted 
her 
on 
the 
shoulder 
and 
himself 
closed 
the 
door 
after 
her.

Princess 
Mary 
went 
back 
to 
her 
room 
with 
the 
sad, 
scared 
expression 
that
rarely 
left 
her 
and 
which 
made 
her 
plain, 
sickly 
face 
yet 
plainer. 
She
sat 
down 
at 
her 
writing 
table, 
on 
which 
stood 
miniature<p>
portraits 
and
which 
was 
littered 
with 
books 
and 
papers. 
The 
princess 
was 
as 
untidy 
as
her 
father 
was 
tidy. 
She 
put 
down 
the<p>
geometry 
book 
and 
eagerly 
broke
the 
seal 
of 
her 
letter. 
It 
was 
from 
her 
most 
intimate 
friend 
from
childhood; 
that 
same 
Julie 
Karagina 
who 
had 
been 
at 
the 
Rostovs'
name-day 
party.

Julie 
wrote 
in 
French:

Dear 
and 
precious 
Friend, 
How 
terrible 
and 
frightful 
a 
thing 
is
separation! 
Though 
I 
tell 
myself 
that 
half 
my 
life 
and 
half 
my 
happiness
are 
wrapped 
up 
in 
you, 
and 
that 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
distance 
separating 
us
our 
hearts 
are 
united 
by 
indissoluble 
bonds, 
my 
heart 
rebels 
against
fate 
and 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
pleasures 
and 
distractions 
around 
me 
I 
cannot
overcome 
a 
certain 
secret 
sorrow 
that 
has 
been 
in 
my 
heart 
ever 
since
we 
parted. 
Why 
are 
we 
not 
together 
as 
we 
were 
last 
summer, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/YI1suxK18NROku.html">in</a> 
your 
big
study, 
on 
the 
blue 
sofa, 
the 
confidential 
sofa? 
Why 
cannot 
I 
now, 
as
three 
months 
ago, 
draw 
fresh<p>
moral 
strength 
from 
your 
look, 
so 
gentle,
calm, 
and 
penetrating, 
a 
look 
I 
loved 
so 
well 
and 
seem 
to 
see 
before 
me
as 
I 
write?

Having 
read 
thus 
far, 
Princess 
Mary 
sighed 
and 
glanced 
into 
the 
mirror
which 
stood 
on 
her 
right. 
It 
reflected 
a 
weak, 
ungraceful 
figure 
and
thin 
face.<p>
Her 
eyes,<p>
always 
sad, 
now 
looked 
with 
particular 
hopelessness
at 
her 
reflection 
in 
the 
glass. 
"She 
flatters 
me," 
thought 
the
princess, 
turning 
away 
and 
continuing 
to 
read. 
But 
Julie 
did 
not 
flatter
her 
friend, 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hO2YWUw3C9.html">princess'</a> 
eyes-large, 
deep 
and 
luminous 
(it 
seemed
as 
if 
at 
times 
there 
radiated 
from 
them 
shafts 
of 
warm
