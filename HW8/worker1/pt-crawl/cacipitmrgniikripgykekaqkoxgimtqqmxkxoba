Paris,

reached. 
The

Napoleon 
himself

no

all

Napoleon

they

Deprived 
of

his

he

CHAPTER 
IV

The 
flood 
of 
nations 
begins 
to 
subside 
into 
its 
normal 
channels. 
The
waves 
of 
the 
great 
movement 
abate, 
and 
on 
the 
calm 
surface 
eddies 
are
formed 
in 
which 
float 
the 
diplomatists, 
who 
imagine 
that 
they 
have
caused 
the 
floods 
to 
abate.

But 
the 
smooth 
sea 
again 
suddenly 
becomes 
disturbed. 
The 
diplomatists
think 
that 
their 
disagreements 
are 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
fresh 
pressure
of 
natural 
forces; 
they 
anticipate 
war 
between 
their 
sovereigns; 
the
position 
seems 
to 
them 
insoluble. 
But 
the 
wave 
they 
feel 
to 
be 
rising
