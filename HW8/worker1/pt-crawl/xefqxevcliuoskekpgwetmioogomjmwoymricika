and 
the 
solitude</h1>which 
refreshed 
her 
at 
Bald 
Hills-and
she 
had 
none 
of 
the 
advantages 
and 
pleasures 
of 
city 
life. 
She<p>
did 
not
go 
out 
into 
society; 
everyone 
knew 
that 
her 
father 
would 
not<p>
let 
her
go 
anywhere 
without 
him, 
and 
his 
failing 
health 
prevented 
his 
going 
out
himself, 
so 
that 
she 
was 
not 
invited 
to 
dinners 
and 
evening 
parties. 
She
had 
quite 
abandoned<p>
the 
hope 
of 
getting 
married. 
She 
saw 
the 
coldness
and 
malevolence 
with 
which 
the 
old 
prince 
received 
and 
dismissed 
the
young 
men, 
possible 
suitors, 
who 
sometimes 
appeared 
at 
their 
house. 
She
had 
no 
friends: 
during 
this 
visit 
to 
Moscow 
she 
had 
been 
disappointed 
in
the 
two 
who 
had 
been 
nearest 
to 
her. 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
with 
whom
she 
had 
never 
been 
able 
to 
be 
quite 
frank, 
had 
now 
become 
unpleasant 
to
her, 
and 
for 
various 
reasons 
Princess 
Mary 
avoided 
her. 
Julie, 
with 
whom
she 
had 
corresponded 
for 
the 
last 
five 
years, 
was 
in 
Moscow, 
but 
proved
to 
be 
quite 
alien 
to 
her 
when 
they 
met. 
Just 
then 
Julie, 
who 
by 
the
death 
of 
her 
brothers 
had 
become 
one 
of 
the 
richest 
heiresses 
in 
Moscow,
was 
in 
the 
full 
whirl 
of 
society 
pleasures. 
She 
was 
surrounded<p>
by 
young
men 
who, 
she 
fancied, 
had 
suddenly 
learned 
to 
appreciate 
her 
worth.
Julie 
was 
at 
that 
stage 
in 
the 
life 
of 
a 
society 
woman 
when 
she 
feels
that 
her 
last 
chance 
of 
marrying 
has 
come 
and 
that 
her 
fate 
must 
be
decided<p>
now 
or 
never. 
On 
Thursdays 
Princess 
Mary 
remembered 
with 
a
mournful 
smile 
that 
she 
now 
had 
no 
one 
to 
write 
to, 
since 
Julie-whose
presence 
gave 
her 
no 
pleasure 
was 
here 
and 
they 
met 
every 
week. 
Like 
the
old 
emigre 
who 
declined 
to 
marry 
the 
lady 
with 
whom 
he<p>
had 
spent 
his
evenings 
for 
years, 
she 
regretted 
Julie's 
presence 
and 
having 
no 
one
to 
write 
to. 
In 
Moscow 
Princess 
Mary 
had 
no 
one 
to 
talk 
to, 
no 
one 
to
whom 
to 
confide 
her 
sorrow, 
and 
much 
sorrow 
fell 
to 
her 
lot 
just 
then.
The 
time 
for 
Prince 
Andrew's 
return 
and 
marriage 
was 
approaching, 
but
his 
request 
to 
her 
to 
prepare 
his 
father 
for 
it 
had 
not 
been 
carried
out; 
in 
fact, 
it 
seemed 
as 
if 
matters 
were 
quite 
hopeless, 
for 
at 
every
mention 
of 
the 
young 
Countess 
Rostova 
the 
old 
prince 
(who 
apart 
from
that 
was 
usually 
in 
a 
bad 
temper) 
lost 
control 
of 
himself. 
Another
lately 
added 
sorrow 
arose 
from 
the 
lessons 
she 
gave 
her 
six 
year-old
nephew. 
To 
her 
consternation 
she 
detected 
in 
herself 
in 
relation 
to
little 
Nicholas 
some 
symptoms 
of 
her 
father's 
irritability. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tB1yf8C0UJpiB.html">However
often</a> 
she 
told 
herself 
that 
she 
must 
not 
get 
irritable 
when 
teaching 
her
nephew, 
almost 
every 
time 
that, 
pointer<p>
in 
hand, 
she 
sat 
down 
to 
show
him 
the 
French 
alphabet, 
she 
so 
longed 
to 
pour 
her 
own 
knowledge 
quickly
and 
easily 
into 
the 
child-who 
was 
already 
afraid 
that 
Auntie 
might 
at
any 
moment 
get 
angry-that 
at 
his 
slightest 
inattention 
she 
trembled,
became 
flustered 
and 
heated, 
raised 
her 
voice, 
and 
sometimes 
pulled 
him
by 
the 
arm 
and 
put 
him 
in 
the<p>
corner. 
Having 
put 
him 
in 
the 
corner
she 
would 
herself 
begin 
to 
cry 
over 
her 
cruel, 
evil 
nature, 
and 
little
Nicholas, 
following 
her 
example, 
would 
sob, 
and 
without 
permission 
would
leave 
his 
corner, 
come 
to 
her, 
pull 
her 
wet 
hands 
from 
her 
face, 
and
comfort 
her. 
<a href="/cZl/xX2z6Jk3Cr.html">But</a> 
what 
distressed 
the 
princess 
most 
of 
all 
was 
her
father's 
irritability, 
which 
was 
always 
directed 
against 
her 
and 
had
of 
late 
amounted 
to 
cruelty. 
Had 
he 
forced 
her 
to 
prostrate 
herself 
to
the 
ground 
all 
night, 
had 
he 
beaten 
her 
or 
made 
her 
fetch 
wood 
or 
water,
it 
would 
never 
have 
entered 
her 
mind 
to 
think 
her 
position 
hard; 
but
this 
loving 
despot-the 
more 
cruel 
because 
he 
loved 
her 
and 
for 
that
reason 
tormented 
himself 
and 
her-knew 
how 
not 
merely 
to 
hurt 
and
humiliate 
her 
deliberately, 
<a href="/nocrawl/c8Rhi6R/ta3Ujvc8V9.html">but</a> 
to 
show 
her 
that 
she 
was 
always 
to 
blame
for
