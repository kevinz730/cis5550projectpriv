all 
what 
is 
glory? 
The</h1>same 
love 
of 
others,
a 
desire 
to 
do 
something 
for 
them, 
a 
desire 
for 
their 
approval.-So 
I
lived 
for 
others, 
and 
not 
almost, 
but 
quite, 
ruined 
my 
life. 
And 
I 
have
become 
calmer 
since 
I 
began 
to 
live 
only 
for 
myself."

"But 
what 
do 
you 
mean 
by 
living 
only 
for 
yourself?" 
asked 
Pierre,
growing 
excited. 
"What 
about 
your 
son, 
your 
sister, 
and 
your
father?"

"But 
that's 
just 
the 
same 
as 
myself-they 
are 
not 
others,"
explained 
Prince 
Andrew. 
"The 
others, 
one's 
neighbors, 
le 
prochain,
as 
you 
and 
Princess 
Mary 
call 
it, 
are 
the 
chief 
source 
of 
all 
error 
and
evil. 
Le 
prochain-your 
Kiev 
peasants 
to 
whom 
you 
want 
to 
do 
good."

And 
he 
looked 
at 
Pierre 
with 
a 
mocking, 
challenging 
expression. 
He
evidently 
wished 
to 
draw 
him 
on.

"You 
are 
joking," 
replied 
Pierre, 
growing 
more 
and 
more 
excited.
"What 
error 
or 
evil 
can 
there 
be 
in 
my 
wishing 
to 
do 
good, 
and 
even
doing 
a 
little-though 
<a href="/cZl/qj9eXK5ZNkA6pXQvm.html">I</a><p>
did<p>
very 
little 
and 
did 
it 
very 
badly? 
What
evil 
can 
there 
be<p>
in 
it 
if 
unfortunate 
people, 
our 
serfs, 
people 
like
ourselves, 
were 
growing 
up 
and 
dying 
with 
no 
idea 
of 
God 
and 
truth
beyond 
ceremonies 
and 
meaningless 
prayers 
<a href="/cZl/KA8qrwB3aAKED9eyxg.html">and</a> 
are 
now 
instructed 
in
a 
comforting 
belief 
in 
future 
life, 
retribution,
