to 
the 
ditch,</h1>struck 
his
horse 
with 
his 
spurs, 
and 
giving 
it 
the<p>
rein 
leaped 
lightly 
over. 
Only
a 
little 
earth 
crumbled 
from 
the 
bank 
under 
the 
horse's 
hind 
hoofs.
Turning 
the 
horse 
sharply, 
he 
again 
jumped 
the 
ditch, 
and 
deferentially
addressed 
the 
horseman 
with 
the 
white 
plumes, 
evidently 
suggesting
that 
he 
should 
do 
the 
same. 
The 
rider, 
whose 
figure 
seemed 
familiar
to 
Rostov 
and 
involuntarily 
riveted 
his 
attention, 
made 
a 
gesture 
of
refusal 
with 
his 
head 
and 
hand 
and 
by 
that 
gesture 
Rostov 
instantly
recognized 
his 
lamented 
and 
adored 
monarch.

"But 
it 
can't 
be 
he, 
alone 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
<a href="/cZl/Xo8fnBp1EPTad8Cr.html">this</a> 
empty 
field!"
thought 
Rostov. 
At 
that 
moment 
Alexander 
turned 
his 
head 
and 
Rostov
saw 
the 
beloved 
features 
that 
were 
so 
deeply 
engraved 
on 
his 
memory. 
The
Emperor 
was 
pale, 
his 
cheeks 
sunken 
and 
his 
eyes 
hollow, 
but 
the 
charm,
the 
mildness 
of 
his 
features, 
was 
all 
the 
greater. 
Rostov 
was 
happy
in 
the 
assurance 
that 
the 
rumors 
about 
the 
Emperor 
being 
wounded 
were
false. 
He 
was 
happy 
to 
be 
seeing 
him. 
He 
knew 
that 
he 
might 
and 
even
ought 
to 
go 
straight 
to 
him 
and 
give 
the 
message<p>
Dolgorukov 
had 
ordered
him 
to 
deliver.

But 
as 
a 
youth 
in 
love 
trembles, 
is 
unnerved, 
and 
dares 
not 
utter 
the
thoughts 
he 
has 
dreamed 
of 
for 
nights, 
but 
looks 
around 
for 
help 
or 
a
chance 
of 
delay 
and 
flight 
when 
the 
longed-for 
moment 
comes 
and 
he 
is
alone 
with 
her, 
so 
Rostov, 
now 
that 
he 
had 
attained 
what 
he 
had 
longed
for 
more 
than 
anything 
else 
in 
the 
world, 
did 
not 
know 
how 
to 
approach
the 
Emperor, 
and 
a 
thousand 
reasons 
occurred 
to 
him 
why 
it 
would 
be
inconvenient, 
unseemly, 
and 
impossible 
to 
do 
so.

"What! 
It 
is 
as 
if 
I 
were 
glad 
of 
a 
chance 
to 
take 
advantage 
of
his 
being 
alone 
and 
despondent! 
A 
strange 
face 
may 
seem 
unpleasant 
or
painful 
to 
him 
at 
this 
moment 
of 
sorrow; 
besides, 
what 
can 
I 
say 
to 
him
now, 
when 
my 
heart 
fails 
me 
and 
my 
mouth 
feels 
dry 
at 
the 
mere 
sight
of 
him?" 
Not 
one 
of 
the 
innumerable 
speeches 
addressed 
to 
the 
Emperor
that 
he 
had 
composed 
in 
his 
imagination 
could 
he 
now 
recall. 
Those
speeches 
were 
intended 
for<p>
quite 
other 
conditions, 
they 
were 
for 
the
most 
part 
to 
be 
spoken 
at 
a 
moment 
of 
victory 
and 
triumph, 
generally
when 
he 
was 
dying 
of 
wounds 
and 
the 
sovereign 
had 
thanked 
him 
for 
heroic
deeds, 
and 
while 
dying 
he 
expressed 
the 
love 
his 
actions 
had 
proved.

"Besides 
how 
can 
I 
ask 
the 
Emperor 
for 
his 
instructions 
for 
the 
right
flank 
now 
that 
it 
is 
nearly 
four 
o'clock 
and 
the 
battle 
is 
lost?
No, 
certainly 
I 
must 
not 
approach 
him, 
I 
must 
not 
intrude 
on 
his
reflections. 
Better 
die<p>
a 
thousand 
times 
than 
risk 
receiving 
an 
unkind
look 
or 
bad 
opinion 
from 
him," 
Rostov 
decided; 
and 
sorrowfully 
and
with 
a 
heart 
full 
despair 
he 
rode 
away, 
continually 
looking 
back 
at 
the
Tsar, 
who 
still 
remained 
in 
the 
same 
attitude 
of 
indecision.

While 
Rostov 
was 
thus 
arguing 
with 
himself 
and 
riding 
sadly 
away,
Captain 
von 
Toll 
chanced 
to 
ride 
to 
the 
same 
spot, 
and 
seeing 
the
Emperor 
at 
once 
rode 
up 
to 
him, 
offered 
his 
services, 
and 
assisted 
him
to 
cross 
the 
ditch 
on 
foot. 
The 
Emperor, 
wishing 
to 
rest 
and 
feeling
unwell, 
sat 
down 
under 
an 
apple 
tree 
and 
von 
Toll 
remained 
beside 
him.
Rostov 
from 
a 
distance 
saw 
with 
envy 
and 
remorse 
how 
von 
Toll 
spoke
long 
and 
warmly 
to 
the 
Emperor 
and 
how 
the 
Emperor, 
evidently 
weeping,
covered 
his 
eyes 
with 
his 
hand 
and 
pressed 
von 
Toll's 
hand.

"And 
I 
might 
have 
been 
in 
his 
place!" 
thought 
Rostov, 
and 
hardly
restraining 
his 
tears 
of 
pity 
for 
the 
Emperor, 
he 
rode 
on 
in 
utter
despair, 
not 
knowing 
where 
to 
or 
why 
he 
was 
now 
riding.
