that

is</h1>well. 
When 
I 
was 
driving
here 
today, 
the 
nearer 
I 
got 
to 
the 
house 
the 
more 
anxious 
I 
grew. 
As 
I
entered 
the 
anteroom 
I 
heard 
Andrusha's 
peals 
of 
laughter 
and 
that 
meant
that 
all 
was 
well."

"I 
know! 
I 
know 
that 
feeling," 
said 
Nicholas. 
"But 
I 
mustn't 
go
there-those 
stockings 
are 
to 
be 
a 
surprise 
for 
me."

Pierre 
went 
to 
the 
children, 
and 
the 
shouting 
and 
laughter 
grew 
still
louder.

"Come, 
Anna 
Makarovna," 
Pierre's 
voice 
was 
heard 
saying, 
"come 
here 
into
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room 
and 
at 
the 
word 
of 
command, 
'One, 
two,' 
and
when 
I 
say 
'three'... 
You 
stand 
here, 
and 
you 
in 
my 
arms-well 
now! 
One,
two!..." 
said 
Pierre, 
and 
a 
silence 
followed: 
"three!" 
and 
a 
rapturously
breathless 
cry 
of 
children's 
voices 
filled 
the 
room. 
"Two, 
two!" 
they
shouted.

This 
meant 
two 
stockings, 
which 
by 
a 
secret 
process 
known 
only 
to
herself 
Anna 
Makarovna 
used 
to 
knit 
at 
the 
same 
time 
on 
the 
same
needles, 
and 
which, 
when 
they 
were 
ready, 
she 
always 
triumphantly 
drew,
one 
out 
of 
the 
other, 
in 
the 
children's 
presence.





CHAPTER 
XIV

Soon 
after 
this 
the 
children 
came 
in 
to<p>
say 
good 
night. 
They 
kissed
everyone, 
the 
tutors 
and 
governesses 
made 
their 
bows, 
and 
they 
went 
out.
Only 
young 
Nicholas 
and 
his 
tutor 
remained. 
Dessalles 
whispered 
to 
the
boy 
to 
come 
downstairs.

"No, 
Monsieur 
Dessalles, 
I 
will 
ask 
my 
aunt 
to 
let 
me 
stay," 
replied
Nicholas 
Bolkonski 
also 
in 
a 
whisper.

"Ma 
tante, 
please 
let 
me 
stay," 
said 
he, 
going 
up 
to 
his 
aunt.

His 
face 
expressed 
entreaty, 
agitation, 
and 
ecstasy. 
Countess 
Mary
glanced 
at 
him 
and 
turned 
to 
Pierre.

"When 
you 
are 
here 
he 
can't 
tear 
himself 
away," 
she 
said.

"I 
will 
bring 
him 
to 
you 
directly, 
Monsieur 
Dessalles. 
Good 
night!"
said 
Pierre, 
giving 
his 
hand 
to 
the 
Swiss 
tutor, 
and 
he 
turned 
to 
young
Nicholas 
with 
a 
smile. 
"You 
and 
I 
haven't 
seen 
anything 
of 
one 
another
yet.... 
How 
like 
he 
is 
growing, 
Mary!" 
he 
added, 
addressing 
Countess
Mary.

"Like 
my 
father?" 
asked 
the 
boy, 
flushing 
crimson 
and 
looking 
up 
at
Pierre 
with 
bright, 
ecstatic 
eyes.

Pierre 
nodded, 
and 
went 
on 
with 
what 
he 
had 
been 
saying 
when 
the
children 
had 
interrupted. 
Countess 
Mary 
sat 
down 
doing 
woolwork; 
Natasha
did 
not 
take 
her 
eyes 
off 
her 
husband. 
Nicholas 
and 
Denisov 
rose, 
asked
for 
their 
pipes, 
smoked, 
went 
to 
fetch 
more 
tea 
from 
Sonya-who 
sat 
weary
but 
resolute 
at 
the 
samovar-and 
questioned 
Pierre. 
The 
curly-headed,
delicate 
boy 
sat 
with 
shining 
eyes 
unnoticed 
in 
a 
corner, 
starting
every 
now 
and 
then 
and 
muttering 
something 
to 
himself, 
and 
evidently
experiencing 
a<p>
new 
and 
powerful 
emotion 
as 
he 
turned 
his 
curly 
head,
with<p>
his 
thin 
neck 
exposed 
by 
his 
turn-down 
collar, 
toward 
the 
place
where 
Pierre 
sat.

The 
conversation 
turned 
on<p>
the 
contemporary 
gossip 
about 
those 
in 
power,
in 
which 
most 
people 
see 
the 
chief 
interest 
of 
home 
politics. 
Denisov,
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
government 
on 
account 
of 
his 
own 
disappointments
in 
the 
service, 
heard 
with 
pleasure 
of 
the 
things 
done 
in 
Petersburg
which 
seemed 
to 
him 
stupid, 
and 
made 
forcible 
and 
sharp 
comments 
on 
what
Pierre 
told 
them.

"One 
used 
to 
have 
to 
be 
a 
German-now 
one 
must 
dance 
with 
Tatawinova
and 
Madame 
Kwuedener, 
and 
wead 
Ecka'tshausen 
and 
the 
bwethwen. 
Oh, 
they
should 
let 
that 
fine<p>
fellow 
Bonaparte 
loose-he'd 
knock 
all 
this 
nonsense
out 
of 
them! 
Fancy 
giving 
the 
command 
of 
the 
Semenov 
wegiment 
to 
a
fellow 
like 
that 
Schwa'tz!" 
he 
cried.

Nicholas, 
though 
free 
from 
Denisov's 
readiness 
to 
find 
fault 
with
everything, 
also 
thought 
that 
discussion 
of 
the 
government 
was 
a 
very
serious 
and 
weighty 
matter, 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
A 
had 
been 
appointed
Minister 
of 
This 
and 
B
