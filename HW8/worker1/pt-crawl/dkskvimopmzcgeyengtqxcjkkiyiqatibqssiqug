And 
the 
owner 
of 
the 
manly 
voice, 
evidently 
an 
infantry 
officer,
laughed.

"Yes, 
one 
is 
afraid," 
continued 
the 
first 
speaker, 
he 
of 
the
familiar 
voice. 
"One 
is 
afraid 
of 
the 
unknown, 
that's 
what 
it 
is.
Whatever 
we 
may 
say 
about 
the 
soul 
going 
to 
the 
sky... 
we 
know 
there 
is
no 
sky 
but 
only 
an 
atmosphere."

The 
manly 
voice 
again 
interrupted 
the 
artillery 
officer.

"Well, 
stand 
us 
some 
of 
your 
herb 
vodka, 
Tushin," 
it 
said.

"Why," 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"that's 
the 
captain 
who<p>
stood 
up
in 
the 
sutler's 
hut 
without 
his 
boots." 
He 
recognized 
the 
agreeable,
philosophizing 
voice 
with 
pleasure.

"Some 
herb 
vodka? 
Certainly!" 
said 
Tushin. 
"But 
still, 
to
conceive 
a 
future 
life..."

He 
did 
not 
finish. 
Just 
then 
there 
was 
a 
whistle 
in 
the 
air; 
nearer 
and
nearer, 
faster 
and 
louder, 
louder 
and 
faster, 
a 
cannon 
ball, 
as 
<a href="/cZl/Qc8mJ71Uo.html">if</a> 
it
had 
not 
finished 
saying 
what 
was 
necessary, 
thudded 
into 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Da5Z0Nec3oRCc.html">the</a> 
ground 
near
the 
shed 
with 
super 
human 
force, 
throwing 
up 
a 
mass 
of 
earth. 
The 
ground
seemed 
to 
groan 
at 
the 
terrible 
impact.

And 
immediately 
Tushin, 
with 
a 
short 
pipe 
in 
the 
corner 
of 
his 
mouth
and 
his 
kind, 
intelligent 
face 
rather 
pale, 
rushed 
out 
of 
the 
shed
followed 
by 
the 
owner 
of 
the 
manly 
voice, 
a 
dashing 
infantry 
officer 
who
hurried 
off 
to 
his 
company, 
buttoning 
up 
his 
coat 
as 
he 
ran.





CHAPTER 
XVII

Mounting 
his 
horse 
again 
Prince 
Andrew 
lingered 
with 
the 
battery,
looking 
at 
the 
puff 
from 
the 
gun 
that 
had 
sent 
the 
ball. 
His 
eyes
ran 
rapidly 
over 
the 
wide 
space, 
but 
he 
only 
saw 
that 
the 
hitherto
motionless 
masses 
of 
the 
French 
now 
swayed 
and 
that 
there 
really 
was
a 
battery 
to 
their 
left. 
The 
smoke 
above 
it 
had 
not 
yet 
dispersed. 
Two
mounted 
Frenchmen, 
probably 
adjutants, 
were 
galloping 
up 
the 
hill. 
<a href="/aVzUge/jS1VWVhi1fvg3.html">A
small</a> 
but 
distinctly 
visible 
enemy 
column 
was 
moving 
down 
the 
hill,
probably 
to 
strengthen 
the 
front 
line. 
The 
smoke 
of 
the 
first 
shot 
had
not 
yet 
dispersed 
before 
another 
puff 
appeared, 
followed 
by 
a 
report.
The 
battle 
had 
begun! 
Prince 
Andrew 
turned 
his 
horse 
and 
galloped 
back
to 
Grunth 
to 
find 
Prince 
Bagration. 
He 
heard 
the 
cannonade 
behind 
him
growing 
louder 
and 
more 
frequent. 
Evidently<p>
our 
guns 
had 
begun 
to 
reply.
From 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
slope, 
where 
the 
parleys 
had 
taken 
place, 
came
the 
report 
of 
musketry.

Lemarrois 
had 
just 
arrived 
at 
a 
gallop 
with 
Bonaparte's 
stern 
letter,
and 
Murat, 
humiliated 
and 
anxious 
to 
expiate 
his 
fault, 
had 
at 
once
moved 
his 
forces 
to 
attack 
the 
center 
and 
outflank<p>
both 
the 
Russian
wings, 
hoping 
before 
evening 
and 
<a href="/cZl/Nz6YyaBP3SEu2IoNM.html">before</a> 
the 
arrival 
of 
the 
Emperor 
to
crush 
the 
contemptible 
detachment 
that 
stood 
before 
him.

"It 
has 
begun. 
Here 
it<p>
is!" 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
feeling 
the
blood 
rush 
to 
his 
heart. 
"But 
where 
and 
how 
will 
my 
Toulon 
present
itself?"

Passing 
between 
the 
companies 
that 
had 
been 
eating 
porridge 
and 
drinking
vodka 
a 
quarter 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZV5hW0bZDWZ8GFXfk.html">of</a> 
an 
hour 
before, 
he 
saw 
everywhere 
the 
same 
rapid
movement 
of 
soldiers 
forming 
ranks 
and 
getting 
their 
muskets 
ready,
and 
on 
all 
their 
faces 
he 
recognized
