peasant 
carts 
that 
had</h1>come 
in 
from 
their
estates 
and 
which 
many 
people 
envied 
proved 
to 
be 
extremely 
valuable 
and
they 
were 
offered<p>
enormous 
sums 
of 
money 
for 
them. 
Not 
only 
were 
huge
sums<p>
offered 
<a href="/aVzUge/Wk68gle0TkvQH.html">for</a> 
the 
horses 
and<p>
carts, 
but 
on 
the 
previous 
evening 
and
early 
in 
the 
morning 
of 
the 
first 
of 
September, 
orderlies 
and<p>
servants
sent 
by 
wounded 
officers 
came 
to 
the 
Rostovs' 
and 
wounded 
men 
dragged
themselves 
there 
from 
the 
Rostovs' 
and 
from 
neighboring 
houses 
where
they 
were 
accommodated, 
entreating 
the 
servants 
to 
try 
to 
get 
them
a 
lift 
out 
of 
Moscow. 
The 
major-domo 
to 
whom 
these 
entreaties 
were
addressed, 
though 
he 
was 
sorry 
for 
the 
wounded, 
resolutely 
refused,
saying 
that 
he 
dare 
not 
even 
mention 
the 
matter 
to 
the 
count. 
Pity 
these
wounded 
men<p>
as 
one 
might, 
it 
was 
evident 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/itU7CT29bqaJj.html">that</a> 
if 
they 
were 
given 
one
cart 
there 
would 
be 
no 
reason 
to 
refuse 
another, 
or 
all 
the 
carts 
and
one's 
own 
carriages 
as 
well. 
Thirty 
carts 
could 
not 
save 
all 
the 
wounded
and 
in 
the 
general 
catastrophe 
one 
could 
not 
disregard 
oneself 
and 
one's
own 
family. 
So 
thought 
the 
major-domo 
on 
his 
master's 
behalf.

On 
waking 
up 
that 
morning 
Count 
Ilya 
Rostov 
left 
his 
bedroom 
softly, 
so
as 
not 
to 
wake 
the 
countess 
who 
had 
fallen 
asleep 
only 
toward 
morning,
and 
came 
out 
to 
the 
porch 
in 
his 
lilac 
silk 
dressing 
gown. 
In 
the 
yard
stood 
the 
carts 
ready 
corded. 
The 
carriages 
were 
at 
the 
front 
porch.
The 
major-domo 
stood 
at 
the 
porch 
talking 
to 
an 
elderly 
orderly 
and 
to
a 
pale 
young 
officer 
with 
a 
bandaged 
arm. 
On 
seeing 
the 
count 
the
major-domo 
made 
a 
significant 
and 
stern 
gesture 
to 
them 
both 
to 
go 
away.

"Well, 
Vasilich, 
is 
everything 
ready?" 
asked 
the 
count, 
and 
stroking 
his
bald 
head 
he 
looked<p>
good-naturedly 
at 
the 
officer 
and 
the 
orderly 
and
nodded 
to 
them. 
(He 
liked 
to 
see 
new 
faces.)

"We 
can 
harness 
at 
once, 
your 
excellency."

"Well, 
that's 
right. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
countess 
wakes 
we'll 
be 
off, 
God
willing! 
What 
is 
it, 
gentlemen?" 
he 
added, 
turning 
to 
the 
officer. 
"Are
you 
staying 
in 
my 
house?"

The 
officer 
came 
nearer 
and 
suddenly 
his 
face 
flushed 
crimson.

"Count, 
be 
so 
good 
as 
to 
allow 
me... 
for 
God's 
sake, 
to 
get 
into 
some
corner 
of 
one 
of 
your 
carts!
