No

laughter, 
or 
smiles 
even, 
were 
seen 
among 
all
these 
men. 
They 
evidently 
all 
made 
an 
effort 
to 
hold 
themselves 
at 
the
height 
the 
situation<p>
demanded. 
And 
all 
these 
groups, 
while 
talking
among 
themselves, 
tried 
to 
keep 
near 
the 
commander 
in 
chief<p>
(whose
bench 
formed 
the 
center 
of 
the 
gathering) 
and 
to 
speak 
so 
that<p>
he 
might
overhear 
them. 
The 
commander 
in 
chief 
listened 
to 
what 
was 
being 
said
and 
sometimes 
asked 
them 
to 
repeat 
their 
remarks, 
but 
did 
not 
himself
take 
part 
in 
the 
conversations 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cg8tTZW1wUl0s.html">or</a> 
express 
any 
opinion. 
After 
hearing
what 
was 
being 
said 
by 
one 
or 
other 
of 
these 
groups 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZV5hW0bZDWZ8GFXfk.html">he</a> 
generally 
turned
away 
with 
an 
air 
of 
disappointment, 
as 
though 
they 
were 
not 
speaking 
of
anything 
he 
wished 
to 
hear. 
Some 
discussed 
the 
position 
that 
had 
been
chosen, 
criticizing 
not 
the 
position 
itself 
so 
much 
as 
the 
mental
capacity 
of 
those 
who 
had 
chosen 
it. 
Others 
argued 
that 
a 
mistake 
had
been 
made 
earlier 
and 
that 
a 
battle 
should 
have 
been 
fought 
two 
days
before. 
Others 
again 
spoke 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Salamanca,
