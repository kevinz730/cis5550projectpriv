her 
talk</h1>with 
Dron 
and 
at 
the 
meeting, 
had 
actually 
had 
so 
bad 
an 
effect
that 
Dron 
had 
finally 
given 
up 
the 
keys 
and 
joined 
the 
peasants 
and 
had
not 
appeared 
when 
Alpatych 
sent 
for 
him; 
and 
that 
in 
the 
morning 
when
the 
princess 
gave 
orders 
to 
harness 
for 
her 
journey, 
the 
peasants 
had
come 
in 
a 
large 
crowd 
to 
the 
barn 
and 
sent 
word 
that 
they 
would 
not 
let
her 
leave 
the 
village: 
that 
there 
was 
an 
order 
not 
to 
move, 
and 
that
they 
would 
unharness 
the 
horses. 
Alpatych 
had 
gone 
out 
to 
admonish 
them,
but 
was 
told 
(it 
was 
chiefly 
Karp 
who 
did 
the 
talking, 
Dron 
not 
showing
himself 
in 
the 
crowd) 
that 
they 
could 
not 
let 
the 
princess 
go, 
that
there 
was 
an 
order 
to 
the 
contrary, 
but 
that 
if 
she 
stayed 
they<p>
would
serve 
her 
as 
before 
and 
obey 
her 
in 
everything.

At 
the 
moment 
when 
Rostov 
and 
Ilyin 
were 
galloping 
along 
the 
road,
Princess 
Mary, 
despite 
the 
dissuasions 
of 
Alpatych, 
her 
nurse, 
and 
the
maids, 
had 
given 
orders 
to 
harness 
and 
intended 
to 
start, 
but 
when 
the
cavalrymen 
were 
espied 
they 
were 
taken 
for 
Frenchmen, 
the 
coachman 
ran
away, 
and 
the 
women 
in 
the 
house 
began 
to 
wail.

"Father! 
Benefactor! 
God 
has 
sent 
you!" 
exclaimed 
deeply 
moved 
voices 
as
Rostov 
passed 
through 
the 
anteroom.

Princess 
Mary 
was 
sitting 
helpless 
and 
bewildered 
in 
the 
large 
sitting
room, 
when 
Rostov 
was 
shown 
in. 
She 
could 
not 
grasp 
who 
he 
was 
and 
why
he 
had 
come, 
or 
what 
was 
happening 
to 
her. 
When 
she 
saw 
his 
Russian
face, 
and 
by 
his 
walk 
and 
the 
first 
words 
he 
uttered 
recognized 
him 
as 
a
man 
of 
her 
own 
class, 
she 
glanced 
at 
him 
with 
her 
deep 
radiant 
look 
and
began 
speaking 
in 
a 
voice 
that 
faltered 
and 
trembled 
with 
emotion. 
This
meeting 
immediately 
struck 
Rostov 
as 
a 
romantic 
event. 
"A 
helpless 
girl
overwhelmed 
with 
grief, 
left 
to 
the 
mercy 
of<p>
coarse, 
rioting 
peasants!
And 
what 
a 
strange 
fate 
sent 
me 
here! 
What 
gentleness 
and 
nobility 
there
are 
in 
her 
features 
and 
expression!" 
thought 
he 
as 
he 
looked 
at 
her 
and
listened 
to 
her 
timid 
story.

When 
she 
began 
to 
tell 
him 
that 
all 
this 
had 
happened 
the 
day 
after 
her
father's 
funeral, 
her 
voice 
trembled. 
She 
turned 
away, 
and 
then, 
as 
if
fearing 
he 
might 
take 
her 
words 
as 
meant 
to 
move 
him 
to 
pity, 
looked 
at
him 
with 
an 
apprehensive 
glance 
of 
inquiry. 
There 
were 
tears 
in 
Rostov's
eyes. 
Princess 
Mary 
noticed 
this 
and 
glanced 
gratefully 
at 
him 
with 
that
radiant 
look 
which 
caused 
the 
plainness 
of 
her 
face 
to 
be 
forgotten.

"I 
cannot 
express, 
Princess, 
how<p>
glad 
I 
am 
that 
I 
happened 
to 
ride 
here
and 
am 
able 
to 
show 
my 
readiness 
to 
serve 
you," 
said 
Rostov, 
rising. 
"Go
when 
you 
please, 
and 
I 
give 
you 
my 
word 
of 
honor 
that 
no 
one 
shall 
dare
to 
cause 
you 
annoyance 
if 
only 
you 
will 
allow 
me 
to 
act 
as 
your 
escort."
And 
bowing<p>
respectfully, 
as 
if 
to 
a 
lady 
of 
royal 
blood, 
he 
moved 
toward
the 
door.

Rostov's 
deferential 
tone 
seemed 
to 
indicate 
that 
though 
he 
would
consider 
himself 
happy 
to 
be 
acquainted 
with 
her, 
he 
did 
not 
wish 
to
take 
advantage 
of 
her 
misfortunes 
to 
intrude 
upon 
her.

Princess 
Mary 
understood 
this 
and 
appreciated 
his 
delicacy.

"I 
am 
very, 
very 
grateful 
to 
you," 
she<p>
said 
in 
French, 
"but 
I 
hope 
it
was 
all 
a 
misunderstanding 
and 
that 
no 
one 
is 
to 
blame 
for 
it." 
She
suddenly 
began 
to 
cry.

"Excuse 
me!" 
she 
said.

Rostov, 
knitting 
his 
brows, 
left 
the 
room 
with 
another 
low 
bow.





CHAPTER 
XIV

"Well, 
is 
she<p>
pretty? 
Ah, 
friend-my 
pink 
one 
is 
delicious; 
her 
name 
is
Dunyasha...."

But 
on 
glancing 
at 
Rostov's 
face 
Ilyin 
stopped 
short. 
He 
saw 
that 
his
hero 
and 
commander 
was 
following 
quite 
a 
different 
train 
of 
thought.

Rostov 
glanced 
angrily 
at 
Ilyin 
and 
without 
replying 
strode 
off 
with
rapid 
steps 
to 
the 
village.

"I'll 
show 
them; 
I'll 
give 
it 
to 
them, 
the 
brigands!" 
said 
he 
to
himself.

Alpatych 
at 
a 
gliding 
trot, 
only 
just 
managing 
not 
to 
run, 
kept 
up 
with
him 
with 
difficulty.

"What 
decision 
have 
you 
been 
pleased 
to 
come 
to?" 
said 
he.

Rostov 
stopped 
and, 
clenching 
his 
fists, 
suddenly 
and 
sternly 
turned
