Where 
would 
he</h1>live?
Was 
he 
going 
to 
rebuild? 
When 
was 
he 
going 
to 
Petersburg 
and 
would 
he
mind 
taking 
a 
parcel 
for 
someone?-he 
replied: 
"Yes, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ak2v5mbEd1ahj.html">perhaps,"</a> 
or, 
"I
think 
so," 
and 
so 
on.

He 
had 
heard 
that 
the 
Rostovs 
were 
at 
Kostroma 
but 
the 
thought 
of
Natasha 
seldom 
occurred 
to 
him. 
If 
it 
did 
it 
was 
only 
as 
a 
pleasant
memory 
of 
the 
distant<p>
past. 
He 
felt 
himself 
not 
only 
free 
from 
social
obligations 
but 
also 
from 
that 
feeling 
which, 
it 
seemed 
to 
him, 
he 
had
aroused 
in 
himself.

On 
the 
third 
day 
after 
his 
arrival 
he 
heard 
from 
the 
Drubetskoys 
that
Princess 
Mary 
was 
in 
Moscow. 
The 
death, 
sufferings, 
and 
last 
days 
of
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
often 
occupied 
Pierre's 
thoughts 
and 
now 
recurred 
to
him 
with 
fresh 
vividness. 
Having 
heard 
at 
dinner 
that 
Princess 
Mary
was 
in 
Moscow 
and 
living 
in 
her 
house-which 
had 
not 
been 
burned-in
Vozdvizhenka 
Street, 
he 
drove 
that 
same 
evening 
to 
see 
her.

On 
his 
way 
to 
the 
house 
Pierre 
kept 
thinking 
of 
Prince 
Andrew, 
of 
their
friendship, 
of 
his 
various 
meetings 
with 
him, 
and 
especially 
of 
the 
last
one 
at 
Borodino.

"Is 
it 
possible 
that 
he 
died 
in 
the 
bitter 
frame 
of 
mind 
he 
was 
then 
in?
Is 
it 
possible 
that 
the 
meaning 
of 
life 
was 
not 
disclosed 
to 
him
before 
he 
died?" 
thought 
Pierre. 
He 
recalled 
Karataev 
and 
his 
death 
and
involuntarily 
began 
to 
compare 
these 
two 
men, 
so 
different, 
and 
yet 
so
similar 
in 
that 
they 
had 
both 
lived 
and 
both 
died 
and 
in 
the 
love 
he
felt 
for 
both 
of 
them.
