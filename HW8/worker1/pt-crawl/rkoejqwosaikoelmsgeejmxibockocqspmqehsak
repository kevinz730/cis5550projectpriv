horsemen 
galloped 
up 
to<p>
the 
opposite 
flank, 
and
at 
the 
head 
of 
them 
Rostov 
recognized 
Napoleon. 
It 
could 
be 
no 
one
else. 
He 
came 
at 
a 
gallop, 
wearing<p>
a 
small 
hat, 
a 
blue 
uniform 
open 
over
a 
white 
vest, 
and 
the 
St. 
Andrew 
ribbon 
over 
his 
shoulder. 
He 
was 
riding
a 
very 
fine 
thoroughbred 
gray 
Arab 
horse 
with 
a 
crimson 
gold-embroidered
saddlecloth. 
On 
approaching 
Alexander 
he 
raised 
his 
hat, 
and 
as 
he 
did
so, 
Rostov, 
with 
his 
cavalryman's 
eye, 
could 
not 
help 
noticing
that 
Napoleon 
did 
not 
sit 
well 
or 
firmly 
in 
the 
saddle. 
The 
battalions
shouted 
"Hurrah!" 
and 
"Vive 
l'Empereur!" 
Napoleon 
said
something 
to 
Alexander, 
and 
both 
Emperors 
dismounted 
and 
took 
each
other's 
hands. 
Napoleon's 
face 
wore 
an 
unpleasant 
and 
artificial
smile. 
Alexander 
was 
saying 
something 
affable 
to 
him.

In 
spite 
of 
the 
trampling 
of 
the 
French 
gendarmes' 
horses, 
which
were 
pushing 
back 
the 
crowd, 
Rostov 
kept 
his 
eyes 
on 
every 
movement
of 
Alexander
