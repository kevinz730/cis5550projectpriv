tried 
to 
talk
of 
other 
things 
and 
to 
look 
in 
other 
directions, 
thought 
only 
of 
what
was 
there 
on 
the 
hilltop, 
and 
kept 
constantly 
looking 
at 
the 
patches
appearing 
on 
the 
skyline, 
which 
they 
knew 
to<p>
be 
<a href="/cZl/UrT8C9b1.html">the</a> 
enemy's 
troops.
The 
weather 
had 
cleared 
again 
since 
noon 
and 
<a href="/cZl/Ly7t1f4hK.html">the</a> 
sun 
was 
descending
brightly 
upon 
the 
Danube 
and 
the 
dark 
hills 
around 
it. 
It 
was 
calm, 
and
at 
intervals 
the 
bugle 
calls 
and 
the 
shouts 
of 
the 
enemy 
could 
be 
heard
from 
the 
hill. 
There 
was 
no 
one 
now 
between 
the 
squadron 
and 
the 
enemy
except 
a 
few 
scattered 
skirmishers. 
An 
empty 
space 
of 
some 
seven 
hundred
yards 
was 
all 
that 
separated 
them. 
The 
enemy 
ceased 
firing, 
and 
that
stern, 
threatening, 
inaccessible, 
and 
intangible 
line 
which 
separates
two 
hostile 
armies 
was 
all 
the 
more 
clearly 
felt.

"One 
step 
beyond<p>
that 
boundary 
line 
which 
resembles 
the 
line 
dividing
the 
living 
from 
the 
dead 
lies 
uncertainty, 
suffering, 
and 
death. 
And
what 
is 
there? 
Who 
is 
there?-there 
beyond 
that 
field, 
that 
tree, 
that
roof 
lit 
up 
by 
the 
sun? 
No 
one 
knows, 
but 
one 
wants 
to 
know. 
You 
fear
and 
yet 
long 
to 
cross<p>
that 
line, 
and 
know 
that 
sooner 
or 
later 
it 
must
be 
crossed 
and 
you 
will 
have 
to 
find 
out 
what 
is 
there, 
just 
as 
you 
will
inevitably 
have 
to 
learn 
what 
lies 
the 
other 
side 
of 
death. 
But 
you 
are
strong, 
healthy, 
cheerful, 
and 
excited, 
and 
are 
surrounded 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/CF8pAy3cLYU4Z.html">by</a> 
other 
such
excitedly 
animated 
and 
healthy 
men." 
So 
thinks, 
or 
at 
any 
rate
feels, 
anyone 
who 
comes 
in 
sight 
of 
the 
enemy, 
and 
that 
feeling 
gives
a 
particular 
glamour 
and 
glad 
keenness 
of 
impression 
to 
everything 
that
takes 
place 
at 
such 
moments.

On 
the 
high 
ground 
where 
the 
enemy 
was, 
the 
smoke 
of 
a 
cannon 
rose,
and 
a 
ball 
flew 
whistling 
over 
the 
heads 
of 
the 
hussar 
squadron. 
The
officers 
who 
had 
been 
standing 
together 
rode 
off 
to 
their<p>
places. 
The
hussars 
began 
carefully 
aligning 
their 
horses. 
Silence 
fell 
on 
the 
whole
squadron. 
All 
were 
looking 
at 
the 
enemy 
in 
front 
and 
at 
the 
squadron
commander, 
awaiting 
the 
word 
of 
command. 
A 
second 
and 
a 
third 
cannon
ball 
flew 
past. 
Evidently 
they 
were 
firing 
<a href="/cZl/fF76zlSDj1rFtA.html">at</a> 
the 
hussars, 
but 
the 
balls
with 
rapid 
rhythmic 
whistle 
flew 
over 
the 
heads 
of
