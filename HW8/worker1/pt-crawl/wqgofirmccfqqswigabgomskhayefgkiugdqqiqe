by 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jJ2zWn6AF9mbEd.html">that</a></h1>shout, 
if
only 
to 
express 
his 
rapture 
fully.

The 
Tsar 
stopped 
a 
few 
minutes 
in 
front 
of 
the 
hussars 
as 
if 
undecided.

"How 
can 
the 
Emperor 
be 
undecided?" 
thought 
Rostov, 
but 
then 
even
this 
indecision 
appeared 
to 
him 
majestic 
and 
enchanting, 
like 
everything
else 
the 
Tsar 
did.

That 
hesitation 
lasted 
only 
an 
instant. 
The 
Tsar's 
foot, 
in 
the 
narrow
pointed 
boot 
then 
fashionable, 
touched 
the 
groin 
of 
the 
bobtailed 
bay
mare 
he 
rode, 
his 
hand 
in 
a 
white 
glove 
gathered 
up 
the 
reins, 
and 
he
moved 
off 
accompanied 
by 
an 
irregularly 
swaying 
sea 
of 
aides-de-camp.
Farther 
and 
farther 
he 
rode 
away, 
stopping 
at 
other 
regiments, 
till 
at
last 
only 
his 
white 
plumes 
were 
visible 
to 
Rostov 
from 
amid 
the 
suites
that 
surrounded 
the 
Emperors.

Among 
the 
gentlemen 
of 
the 
suite, 
Rostov 
noticed 
Bolkonski, 
sitting
his 
horse 
indolently 
and 
carelessly. 
Rostov 
recalled 
their 
quarrel 
of
yesterday 
and 
the 
question 
presented 
itself 
whether 
he 
ought 
or 
ought
not 
to 
challenge 
Bolkonski. 
"Of 
course 
not!" 
he 
now 
thought. 
"Is
it 
worth 
thinking 
or 
speaking 
of 
it 
at 
such 
a 
moment? 
At 
a 
time 
of 
such
love, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xA8viB9t0HAb.html">such</a> 
rapture, 
and 
such 
self-sacrifice, 
what 
do 
any 
of 
our 
quarrels
and 
affronts 
matter? 
I 
love 
and 
forgive 
everybody 
now."

When 
the 
Emperor 
had 
passed 
nearly 
all 
the 
regiments, 
the 
troops 
began
a 
ceremonial 
march 
past 
him, 
and 
Rostov 
on 
Bedouin, 
recently 
purchased
from 
Denisov, 
rode 
past 
too, 
at 
the 
rear 
of 
his 
squadron-that 
is,
alone 
and 
in 
full 
view 
of 
the 
Emperor.

Before 
he 
reached 
him, 
Rostov, 
who 
was 
a 
splendid 
horseman, 
spurred
Bedouin 
twice 
and 
successfully 
put 
him 
to 
the 
showy 
trot 
in 
which 
the
animal 
went 
when 
excited. 
Bending 
his 
foaming 
muzzle 
to 
his 
chest, 
his
tail 
extended, 
Bedouin, 
as 
if 
also 
conscious 
of 
the 
<a href="/cZl/qi6zvJ6ej1tsa.html">Emperor's</a> 
eye
upon 
him, 
passed 
splendidly, 
lifting 
his 
feet 
with 
a 
high 
and 
graceful
action, 
as 
if 
flying 
through 
the 
air 
without 
touching 
the 
ground.

Rostov 
himself, 
his 
legs 
well 
back 
and 
his 
stomach 
drawn 
in 
and 
feeling
himself 
one 
with 
his 
horse, 
rode 
past 
the 
Emperor 
with 
<a href="/cZl/PK5ZUI0EXJo9ON.html">a</a> 
frowning 
but
blissful 
face 
"like 
a 
vewy 
devil," 
as 
Denisov 
expressed 
it.

"Fine 
fellows, 
the 
Pavlograds!" 
remarked 
the 
Emperor.

"My 
God, 
how 
happy 
I 
should 
be 
if 
he 
ordered 
me 
to 
leap<p>
into 
the 
fire
this 
instant!" 
thought 
Rostov.

When 
the 
review 
was 
over, 
the 
newly 
arrived 
officers, 
and 
also
Kutuzov's, 
collected 
in 
groups 
and 
began 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
awards,
about 
the 
Austrians 
and 
their 
uniforms, 
about 
their 
lines, 
about
Bonaparte, 
and 
how 
badly 
the 
latter 
would 
fare 
now, 
especially 
if 
the
Essen 
corps 
arrived 
and 
Prussia 
took 
our 
side.

But 
the 
talk 
in 
every 
group 
was 
chiefly 
about 
the 
Emperor 
Alexander. 
His
every 
word 
and 
movement 
was 
described 
with 
ecstasy.

They 
all 
had 
but 
one 
wish: 
to 
advance 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
against 
the
enemy 
under 
the 
Emperor's 
command. 
Commanded 
by 
the 
Emperor 
himself
they 
could
