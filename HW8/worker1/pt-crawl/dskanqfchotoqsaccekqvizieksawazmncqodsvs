CHAPTER 
X

Natasha 
had 
married 
in 
the 
early 
spring 
of 
1813, 
and 
in 
1820 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UZ7GaVr7XZEHJ3bzE.html">already</a> 
had
three 
daughters 
besides 
a 
son 
for 
whom 
she 
had 
longed 
and 
whom 
she 
was
now 
nursing. 
She 
had 
grown 
stouter 
and 
broader, 
so 
that 
it 
was 
difficult
to 
recognize 
in 
this 
robust, 
motherly 
woman 
the 
slim, 
lively 
Natasha 
of
former 
days. 
Her 
features 
were 
more 
defined 
and 
had 
a 
calm, 
soft,
and 
serene 
expression. 
In 
her 
face 
there 
was 
none<p>
of 
the 
ever-glowing
animation 
that 
had 
formerly 
burned 
there 
and 
constituted 
its 
charm.
Now 
her 
face 
and 
body 
were 
often 
all 
that 
one 
saw, 
and 
her 
soul 
was
not 
visible 
at 
all. 
All 
that 
struck 
the 
eye 
was 
a 
strong, 
handsome, 
and
fertile 
woman. 
The 
old 
fire 
very 
rarely 
kindled 
in 
her 
face 
now. 
That
happened 
only 
when, 
as 
was 
the 
case 
that 
day, 
her 
husband 
returned 
home,
or 
a 
sick 
child 
was 
<a href="/cZl/jRO3YXnB5A5mDKi.html">convalescent,</a> 
or 
when 
she 
and 
Countess 
Mary 
spoke 
of
Prince 
Andrew 
(she 
never 
mentioned 
him 
to 
her 
husband, 
who 
she 
imagined
was 
jealous 
of 
Prince 
Andrew's 
memory), 
<a href="/aVzUge/fF3Gbiq6WMNlO3L.html">or</a> 
on 
the 
rare 
occasions 
when
something 
happened 
to 
induce 
her 
to 
sing, 
a 
practice 
she 
had 
quite
abandoned 
since 
her 
marriage. 
At 
the 
rare 
moments 
when 
the 
old 
fire
did 
kindle 
in 
her 
handsome, 
fully 
developed 
body 
she 
was 
even 
more
attractive 
than 
in 
former 
days.

Since 
their 
marriage 
Natasha 
and 
her 
husband 
had 
lived 
in<p>
Moscow, 
in
Petersburg, 
on 
their 
estate 
near 
Moscow, 
or 
with 
her 
mother, 
that 
is 
to
say, 
in 
Nicholas' 
house. 
The 
young 
Countess 
Bezukhova 
was 
not 
often 
seen
in 
society, 
and 
those 
who 
met 
her 
there 
were 
not 
pleased 
with 
her
and 
found 
her 
neither 
attractive 
nor 
amiable. 
Not 
that 
Natasha 
liked
solitude-she 
did 
not 
know 
whether 
she 
liked 
it 
or 
not, 
she 
even 
thought
that 
she 
did 
not-but 
with 
her 
pregnancies, 
her 
confinements, 
the 
nursing
of 
her 
children, 
and 
sharing 
every 
moment 
of 
her 
husband's 
life, 
she 
had
demands 
on 
her 
time 
which 
could 
be 
satisfied 
only 
by 
renouncing 
society.
All 
who 
had 
known 
Natasha 
before 
her 
marriage 
wondered 
at 
the 
change
in 
her 
as 
at 
something 
extraordinary.
