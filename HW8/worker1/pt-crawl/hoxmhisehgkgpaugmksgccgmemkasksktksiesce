have

Turkey 
and 
should 
not 
have 
been 
through 
with 
that 
war.
Everything 
in 
haste, 
but 
more 
haste, 
less 
speed. 
Kamenski 
would 
have
been 
lost 
if 
he 
had 
not 
died. 
He 
stormed 
fortresses 
with 
thirty 
thousand
men. 
It 
is 
not 
difficult 
to<p>
capture 
a 
fortress 
but 
it 
is 
difficult 
to
win 
a 
campaign. 
For 
that, 
not 
storming 
and 
attacking 
but 
patience 
and
time 
are 
wanted. 
Kamenski 
sent 
soldiers 
to 
Rustchuk, 
but 
I 
only 
employed
these 
two 
things 
and 
took 
more 
fortresses 
than 
Kamenski 
and 
made 
them
Turks 
eat 
horseflesh!" 
He 
swayed 
his 
head. 
"And 
the 
French 
shall 
too,
believe 
me," 
he 
went 
on, 
growing 
warmer 
and 
beating 
his 
chest, 
"I'll
make 
them 
eat 
horseflesh!" 
And 
tears 
again 
dimmed<p>
his 
eyes.

 
 
 
<a href="/cZl/dG51mk.html"></a> 
* 
"Everything 
comes 
in 
time 
to 
him 
who 
knows 
how 
to 
wait."


"But 
shan't 
we 
have 
to 
accept 
battle?" 
remarked 
Prince 
Andrew.

"We 
shall 
if 
everybody 
wants 
it; 
it 
can't 
be 
helped.... 
But 
believe
me, 
my 
dear 
boy, 
there 
is 
nothing 
stronger 
than 
those 
two: 
patience 
and
time, 
they 
will 
do 
it 
all. 
But 
the 
advisers 
n'entendent 
pas 
de 
cette
oreille, 
voila 
le 
mal. 
* 
Some 
want 
a 
thing-others 
don't. 
What's 
one 
to
do?" 
he 
asked, 
evidently 
expecting 
an 
answer. 
"Well, 
what 
do 
you 
want
us 
to 
<a href="/aVzUge/SDF43ezc3JedQ.html">do?"</a> 
he 
repeated 
and 
his 
eye 
shone 
with 
a 
deep, 
shrewd 
look.
"I'll 
tell 
you 
what 
to 
do," 
he 
continued, 
as 
Prince 
Andrew 
still 
did 
not
reply: 
"I 
will 
tell 
you 
what 
to 
do,<p>
and 
what 
I 
do. 
Dans 
le 
doute, 
mon
cher," 
he 
paused, 
"abstiens-toi" 
*(2)-he 
articulated 
the 
French 
proverb
deliberately.

 
 
 
 
 
* 
"Don't 
see 
it 
that 
way, 
that's 
the 
trouble."

 
 
 
 
 
* 
(2) 
"When 
in 
doubt, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
do 
nothing."


"Well, 
good-by, 
my 
dear 
fellow; 
remember 
that 
with 
all 
my 
heart 
I 
share
your 
sorrow, 
and 
that 
for 
you 
I 
am 
not 
a 
Serene 
Highness, 
nor 
a 
prince,
nor 
a 
commander 
in 
chief, 
but 
a 
father! 
If 
you 
want 
anything 
come
straight 
to 
me. 
Good-by, 
my 
dear 
boy."

Again 
he 
embraced 
and 
kissed 
Prince 
Andrew, 
but 
before 
the 
latter
had 
left 
the 
room 
Kutuzov 
gave 
a 
sigh 
of 
relief 
and 
went 
on 
with 
his
unfinished 
novel, 
Les 
Chevaliers 
du 
Cygne 
by 
Madame 
de 
Genlis.

Prince 
Andrew 
could 
not 
have 
explained 
how 
or 
why 
it 
was, 
but 
after 
that
interview 
with 
Kutuzov 
he 
went 
back 
to 
<a href="/cZl/tQp9Yvhw6iOfK3lFuWA.html">his</a> 
regiment 
reassured 
as 
to
the 
general 
course 
of 
affairs 
and 
as 
to 
the 
man 
to 
whom 
it 
had 
been
entrusted. 
The 
more 
he 
realized 
the 
absence 
of 
all<p>
personal 
motive 
in
that 
old 
man-in 
whom 
there 
seemed 
to 
remain 
only 
the 
habit 
of 
passions,
and 
in 
place 
of 
an 
intellect 
(grouping 
events 
and 
drawing 
conclusions)
only 
the 
capacity 
calmly 
to 
contemplate 
the 
course 
of 
events-the 
more
reassured 
he 
was 
that 
everything 
would 
be 
as 
<a href="/aVzUge/mx1EnBVm2o0EoOV.html">it</a> 
should. 
"He 
will 
not
bring 
in 
any 
plan 
of 
his 
own. 
He 
will 
not 
devise<p>
or 
undertake
anything," 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"but 
he 
will 
hear 
everything, 
remember
everything, 
and 
put 
everything 
in 
its 
place. 
He 
will 
not 
hinder
anything 
useful 
nor 
allow 
anything 
harmful. 
He 
understands 
that 
there 
is
something 
<a href="/aVzUge/vx1R08LZ.html">stronger</a> 
and 
more 
important 
than 
his 
own 
will-the<p>
inevitable
course 
of 
events, 
and 
he 
can 
see 
them 
and 
grasp 
their 
significance,
and 
seeing<p>
that 
significance 
can 
refrain 
from 
meddling 
and 
renounce 
his
personal 
wish 
directed 
to 
something 
else. 
And 
above 
all," 
thought 
Prince
Andrew, 
"one 
believes 
in 
him 
because 
he's 
Russian, 
despite 
the 
novel
by 
Genlis 
and 
the 
French 
proverbs, 
and 
because 
his 
voice 
shook 
when 
he
said: 
'What 
they 
have 
brought 
us 
to!' 
and 
had 
a 
sob 
in 
it 
when 
he 
said
he 
would 
'make 
them 
eat 
horseflesh!'"

On 
such 
feelings, 
more 
or 
less 
dimly 
shared 
by 
all, 
the 
unanimity 
and
general 
approval 
were 
founded 
with 
which, 
despite 
court 
influences, 
the
popular 
choice 
of 
Kutuzov 
as 
commander 
in 
chief 
was 
received.





CHAPTER 
XVII

After 
the 
Emperor 
had 
left 
Moscow, 
life 
flowed 
on 
there 
in 
its 
usual
course, 
and 
its 
course 
was 
so 
very 
usual 
that 
it 
was 
difficult 
to
remember 
the 
recent 
days 
of 
patriotic 
elation 
and 
ardor, 
hard 
to 
believe
that 
Russia 
was 
really
