instigation, 
gathered 
round 
the
clavichord 
and 
harp. 
Julie 
by 
general 
request 
played 
first. 
After 
she
had 
played 
a 
little 
air 
with 
variations 
on 
the<p>
harp, 
she 
joined 
the
other 
young 
ladies 
in 
begging 
Natasha 
and 
Nicholas, 
who 
were 
noted 
for
their 
musical 
talent, 
to 
sing 
something. 
Natasha, 
who 
was 
treated 
as
though 
she 
were 
grown 
up, 
was 
evidently 
very 
proud 
of 
this 
<a href="/cZl/eI3e7.html">but</a> 
at 
the
same 
time 
felt 
shy.

"What 
shall 
we 
sing?" 
she 
said.

"'The 
Brook,'" 
suggested 
Nicholas.

"Well, 
then, 
let's 
be 
quick. 
Boris, 
come 
here," 
said 
Natasha.
"But 
where 
is 
Sonya?"

She 
looked 
round 
and 
seeing 
that 
her 
friend 
was 
not 
in 
the 
room 
ran 
to
look 
for 
her.

Running 
into 
Sonya's 
room 
and 
not 
finding 
her 
there, 
Natasha 
ran 
to
the 
nursery, 
but 
Sonya 
was 
not 
there 
either. 
Natasha 
concluded 
that
she 
must 
be 
on 
the 
chest 
in 
the 
passage. 
The 
chest 
in 
the 
passage 
was
the 
place 
of 
mourning 
for 
the 
younger 
female 
generation 
in 
the 
Rostov
household. 
And 
there 
in 
fact 
was 
Sonya 
lying 
face 
downward 
on 
Nurse's
dirty 
feather 
bed 
on 
the 
top 
of 
the 
chest, 
crumpling 
her 
gauzy 
pink
dress 
under 
her, 
hiding 
her 
face 
with 
her 
slender 
fingers, 
and 
sobbing
so 
convulsively 
that 
her 
bare 
little 
shoulders 
shook. 
Natasha's
face, 
which 
had 
been 
so 
radiantly 
happy 
all 
that 
saint's 
day, 
suddenly
changed: 
her 
eyes 
became 
fixed, 
and 
then 
a 
shiver 
passed 
down 
her 
broad
neck 
and 
the 
corners 
of 
<a href="/aVzUge/Tk8Ll5rJpLp9d.html">her</a> 
mouth 
drooped.

"Sonya! 
What 
is 
it? 
What 
is 
the 
matter?... 
Oo... 
Oo... 
Oo...!" 
And
Natasha's 
large 
mouth 
widened, 
making 
her 
look 
quite 
ugly, 
and 
she
began 
to 
wail 
like 
a 
baby 
without
