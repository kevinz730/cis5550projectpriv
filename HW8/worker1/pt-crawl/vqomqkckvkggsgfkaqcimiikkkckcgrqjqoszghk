princess 
any
more.</h1>But 
after 
her 
visit 
the 
old 
countess 
spoke 
of 
her 
several 
times 
a
day.

She 
sang 
her 
praises, 
insisted 
that 
her 
son 
must 
call 
on 
her, 
expressed
a 
wish 
to 
see 
her 
often, 
but 
yet 
always 
became 
ill-humored 
when 
she
began 
to 
talk 
about 
her.

Nicholas 
tried 
to 
keep 
silence 
when 
his 
mother 
spoke 
of 
the 
princess,
but 
his 
silence 
irritated 
her.

"She 
is 
a 
very 
admirable 
and 
excellent 
young 
woman," 
said 
she, 
"and 
you
must 
go 
and 
call 
on 
her. 
You 
would 
at 
least 
be 
seeing 
somebody, 
and 
I
think 
it 
must 
be 
dull 
for 
you 
only 
seeing 
us."

"But 
I 
don't 
in 
the 
least 
want 
to, 
Mamma."

"You 
used 
to 
want 
to, 
and 
now 
you 
don't. 
Really 
I 
don't 
understand 
you,
my 
dear. 
One 
day 
you 
are 
dull, 
and 
the 
next 
you 
refuse 
to 
see 
anyone."

"But 
I 
never 
said 
I 
was 
dull."

"Why, 
you 
said 
yourself 
you 
don't 
want 
even 
to 
see 
her. 
She 
is 
a 
very
admirable 
young 
woman 
and 
you 
always 
liked 
her, 
but 
now 
suddenly 
you
have 
got 
some 
notion 
or 
other 
in 
your 
head. 
You 
hide 
everything 
from
me."

"Not 
at 
all, 
Mamma."

"If 
I 
were 
asking 
you 
to 
do 
something 
disagreeable 
now-but 
I 
only 
ask
you 
to 
return 
a 
call. 
One 
would 
think 
mere 
politeness 
required 
it....
Well, 
I 
have 
asked 
you, 
and 
now 
I 
won't 
interfere 
any 
more 
since 
you
have 
secrets 
from 
your 
mother."

"Well, 
then, 
I'll 
go 
if 
you 
wish 
it."

"It 
doesn't 
matter 
to 
me. 
I 
only 
wish 
it 
for 
your 
sake."

Nicholas 
sighed, 
bit 
his 
mustache, 
and 
laid 
out 
the 
cards 
for 
a
patience, 
trying 
to 
divert 
his 
mother's 
attention 
to 
another 
topic.

The 
same 
conversation 
was 
repeated 
next 
day 
and 
the 
day 
after, 
and 
the
day 
<a href="/aVzUge/Lp16inBE1vwOfd.html">after</a> 
that.

After 
her 
visit 
to 
the 
Rostovs 
and 
her 
unexpectedly 
chilly 
reception 
by
Nicholas, 
Princess 
Mary 
confessed 
to 
herself 
that 
she 
had 
been 
right
