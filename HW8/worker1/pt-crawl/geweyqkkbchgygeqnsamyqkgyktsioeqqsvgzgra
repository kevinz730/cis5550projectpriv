"If</h1>you 
allow 
yourself 
in 
my 
drawing 
room..." 
whispered 
Helene, 
but
Pierre 
did 
not 
reply 
and 
went 
out 
of 
the 
room.

Anatole 
followed 
him 
with 
his 
usual 
jaunty 
step 
but 
his 
face 
betrayed
anxiety.

Having 
entered 
his 
study 
Pierre 
closed 
the 
<a href="/cZl/kQ69HPeSU6XZWkd.html">door</a> 
and 
<a href="/cZl/lg7mk5rqw7Yg.html">addressed</a> 
Anatole
without 
looking 
at 
him.

"You 
promised 
Countess 
Rostova 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vh5UTE21.html">to</a> 
marry 
her 
and 
were 
about 
to 
elope 
with
her, 
is 
that 
so?"

"Mon 
cher," 
answered 
Anatole 
(their 
whole 
conversation 
was 
in 
French),
"I 
don't 
consider 
myself 
bound 
to 
answer 
questions 
put 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/giG6iw9DduKC8i.html">to</a> 
me<p>
in 
that
tone."

Pierre's 
face, 
already 
pale, 
became 
distorted 
by 
fury. 
He 
seized 
Anatole
by 
the 
collar 
of 
his 
uniform 
with 
his 
big 
hand 
and 
shook 
him 
from 
side
to 
<a href="/cZl/dA2tQI5SC4.html">side</a> 
till 
Anatole's 
face
