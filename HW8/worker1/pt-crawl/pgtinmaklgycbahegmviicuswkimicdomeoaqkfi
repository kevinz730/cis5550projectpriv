In 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
day 
Murat 
sent 
his 
adjutant 
to 
Napoleon 
to 
demand
reinforcements.

Napoleon 
sat 
at 
the 
foot 
of 
the 
knoll, 
drinking 
punch, 
when 
Murat's
adjutant 
galloped 
up 
with 
an 
assurance 
that 
the 
Russians 
would 
<a href="/aVzUge/zT6w1mAz6Qz.html">be</a> 
routed
if 
His 
Majesty 
would 
let 
him 
have 
another 
division.

"Reinforcements?" 
said 
Napoleon 
in 
a 
tone 
of 
stern 
surprise, 
looking 
at
the 
adjutant-a 
handsome 
lad 
with 
long 
black 
curls 
arranged 
like 
Murat's
own-as 
though 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
his 
words.

"Reinforcements!" 
thought 
Napoleon 
to 
himself. 
"How 
can 
they 
need
reinforcements 
when 
they 
already 
have 
half 
the 
army 
directed 
against 
a
weak, 
unentrenched 
Russian 
wing?"

"Tell 
the 
King 
of 
Naples," 
said 
he 
sternly, 
"that 
it 
is 
not 
noon 
yet,
and 
I 
don't 
yet 
see 
my 
chessboard 
clearly. 
Go!..."

The 
handsome 
boy 
adjutant 
with 
the 
long 
hair 
sighed 
deeply 
without
removing 
his 
hand 
from 
his 
hat 
and 
galloped 
back 
to 
where 
men 
were 
being
slaughtered.

Napoleon 
rose 
and 
having 
summoned 
Caulaincourt 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/gSO9NPT7QD3O.html">Berthier</a> 
began
talking 
to 
them 
<a href="/aVzUge/mbm6iCtOt1bvO1.html">about</a> 
matters 
unconnected 
with 
the 
battle.

In 
the 
midst 
of 
this 
conversation, 
which 
was 
beginning 
to 
interest
Napoleon, 
Berthier's 
eyes 
turned 
to 
look 
at 
a 
general 
with 
a 
suite, 
who
was 
galloping 
toward 
the 
knoll 
on 
a 
lathering 
horse. 
It 
was 
Belliard.
Having 
dismounted 
he 
went 
up 
to 
the 
Emperor 
with 
rapid 
strides 
and 
in
a 
loud 
voice 
began 
boldly 
demonstrating 
the 
necessity 
of 
sending
reinforcements. 
He 
swore 
on 
his 
honor 
that 
the 
Russians 
were<p>
lost 
if 
the
Emperor 
would 
give 
another 
division.

Napoleon 
shrugged 
his 
shoulders 
and
