all 
differences 
of 
faith, 
understood</h1>the 
full
importance 
of 
the 
rite 
now 
being 
performed 
and 
even 
approved 
of 
it. 
He
now 
approached 
the 
sick 
man 
with 
the 
noiseless 
step 
of 
one 
in 
full 
vigor
of 
life, 
with 
his 
delicate<p>
white<p>
fingers 
raised 
from 
the 
green 
quilt 
the
hand 
that 
was 
free, 
and 
turning 
sideways 
felt 
the 
pulse 
and 
reflected
a 
moment. 
The 
sick 
man 
was 
given 
something 
to 
drink, 
there 
was 
a
stir 
around 
him, 
then 
the 
people 
resumed 
their 
places 
and 
the 
service
continued. 
During 
this 
interval 
Pierre 
noticed 
that 
Prince 
Vasili
left 
the 
chair 
on 
which 
he 
had 
been 
leaning, 
and-with 
an 
air
which 
intimated 
that 
he 
knew 
what 
he 
was 
about 
and 
if 
others 
did 
not
understand 
him 
it 
was 
so 
much 
the 
worse 
for 
them-did 
not 
go 
up 
to 
the
dying 
man, 
but 
passed 
by 
him, 
joined 
the 
eldest 
princess, 
and 
moved
with 
her 
to 
the 
side 
of 
the 
room 
where 
stood 
the 
high 
bedstead 
with 
its
silken 
hangings. 
On 
leaving 
the 
bed 
both 
Prince 
Vasili 
and 
the 
princess
passed 
out 
by 
a 
back 
door, 
but 
returned 
to 
their 
places 
one 
after 
the
other 
before 
the 
service 
was 
concluded. 
Pierre 
paid 
no 
more 
attention
to 
this 
occurrence 
than 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
what 
went 
on, 
having 
made 
up 
his
mind 
once 
for 
all 
that 
what 
he 
saw 
happening 
around 
him 
that 
evening 
was
in 
some 
way 
essential.

The 
chanting 
of 
the 
service 
ceased, 
and 
the 
voice 
of 
the 
priest 
was
heard 
respectfully 
congratulating 
the 
dying 
man 
on 
having 
received 
the
sacrament. 
The 
dying 
man 
lay 
as 
lifeless 
and 
immovable 
as 
before. 
Around
him 
everyone 
began 
to 
stir: 
steps 
were 
audible 
and 
whispers, 
among 
which
Anna 
Mikhaylovna's 
was 
the 
most 
distinct.

Pierre<p>
heard 
her 
say:

"Certainly 
he 
must 
be 
moved 
onto 
the 
bed; 
here 
it 
will 
be
impossible..."

The 
sick 
man 
was 
so 
surrounded 
by 
doctors, 
princesses, 
and 
servants
that 
Pierre 
could 
no 
longer 
see 
the 
reddish-yellow 
face 
with 
its 
gray
mane-which, 
though 
he 
saw 
other 
faces 
as 
well, 
he 
had 
not 
lost 
sight
of 
for 
a 
single 
moment 
during 
the 
whole 
service. 
He 
judged 
by 
the
cautious 
movements 
of 
those 
who 
crowded 
round 
the 
invalid<p>
chair 
that
they 
had 
lifted 
the 
dying 
man 
and 
were 
moving 
him.

"Catch 
hold 
of 
my 
arm 
or 
you'll 
drop 
him!" 
he 
heard 
one 
of 
the
servants 
say 
in 
a 
frightened 
whisper. 
"Catch 
hold 
from 
underneath.
Here!" 
exclaimed 
different 
voices; 
and 
the 
heavy 
breathing 
of 
the
bearers 
and 
the 
shuffling 
of 
their 
feet 
grew 
more 
hurried, 
as 
if 
the
weight 
they 
were 
carrying 
were 
too 
much 
for 
them.

As 
the 
bearers, 
among 
whom 
was 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
passed 
the 
young 
man
he 
caught 
a 
momentary 
glimpse 
between 
their 
heads 
and 
backs 
of 
the 
dying
man's 
high, 
stout, 
uncovered 
chest 
and 
powerful 
shoulders, 
raised 
by
those 
who 
were 
holding 
him 
under 
the 
armpits, 
and 
of 
his 
gray, 
curly,
leonine 
head. 
This 
head, 
with 
its 
remarkably 
broad 
brow 
and 
cheekbones,
its 
handsome, 
sensual 
mouth, 
and 
its 
cold, 
majestic 
expression, 
was
not 
disfigured 
by<p>
the 
approach 
of 
death. 
It 
was 
the 
same 
as 
Pierre
remembered 
it 
three 
months 
before, 
when 
the 
count 
had 
sent 
him 
to
Petersburg. 
But 
now 
this 
head 
was 
swaying 
helplessly 
with 
the 
uneven
movements 
of 
the 
bearers, 
and 
the 
cold 
listless 
gaze 
fixed 
itself 
upon
nothing.

After 
a 
few 
minutes' 
bustle 
beside 
the 
high 
bedstead, 
those 
who 
had
carried 
the 
sick 
man 
dispersed. 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
touched 
Pierre's
hand 
and 
said, 
"Come." 
Pierre 
went 
with 
her 
to 
the 
bed 
on 
which 
the
sick 
man 
had 
been 
laid 
in 
a 
stately 
pose 
in 
keeping 
with 
the 
ceremony
just 
completed. 
He 
lay 
with 
his 
head 
propped 
<a href="/aVzUge/Eo4YfX8yG2mrwmb.html">high</a> 
on 
the 
pillows. 
His
hands 
were 
symmetrically 
placed 
on 
the 
green 
silk 
quilt, 
the 
palms
downward. 
When 
Pierre 
came 
up 
the 
count 
was 
gazing 
straight 
at 
him, 
but
with 
a 
look 
the 
significance 
of 
which 
could 
not 
be 
understood 
by 
mortal
man. 
Either 
this 
look 
meant 
nothing 
but 
that 
as 
long 
as 
one 
has
