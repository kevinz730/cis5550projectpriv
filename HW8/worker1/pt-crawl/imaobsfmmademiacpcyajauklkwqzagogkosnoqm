arsenic 
she 
had</h1>stealthily
procured. 
After 
swallowing 
a 
little 
she 
had 
been 
so 
frightened 
that 
she
woke 
Sonya 
and 
told 
her 
what 
she 
had 
done. 
The 
necessary 
antidotes 
had
been 
administered 
in 
time 
and 
she 
was 
now 
out 
of 
danger, 
though 
still 
so
weak 
that 
it 
was 
out 
of 
the 
question 
to 
move 
her 
to 
the 
country, 
and
so 
the 
countess 
had 
been 
sent 
for. 
Pierre 
saw 
the 
distracted 
count, 
and
Sonya, 
who 
had 
a 
tear-stained 
face, 
but 
he 
could 
not 
see 
Natasha.

Pierre 
dined 
at 
the 
club 
that 
day 
and 
heard 
on 
all 
sides 
gossip 
about
the 
attempted 
abduction 
of 
Rostova. 
He 
resolutely 
denied 
these
rumors, 
assuring 
everyone 
that 
nothing 
had 
happened 
except 
that 
his
brother-in-law 
had 
proposed 
to 
her 
and 
been 
refused. 
It 
seemed 
to
Pierre 
that 
it 
was 
his 
duty 
to 
conceal 
the 
whole 
affair 
and 
re-establish
Natasha's 
reputation.

He 
was 
awaiting 
Prince 
Andrew's 
return 
with 
dread 
and<p>
went 
every 
day 
to
the<p>
old 
prince's 
for 
news 
of 
him.

Old 
Prince 
Bolkonski 
heard 
all 
the 
rumors 
current 
in 
the 
town 
from
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
and 
had 
read 
the 
note 
to 
Princess 
Mary 
in 
which
Natasha 
had 
broken 
off 
her 
engagement. 
He 
seemed<p>
in 
better<p>
spirits 
than
usual 
and 
awaited 
his 
son 
with 
great 
impatience.

Some 
days 
after 
Anatole's 
departure 
Pierre 
received 
a 
note 
from 
Prince
Andrew, 
informing 
him 
of 
his 
<a href="/cZl/up4Xs5AF1tTZW.html">arrival</a> 
and 
asking<p>
him 
to 
come 
to 
see 
him.

As 
soon 
as 
he 
reached 
Moscow, 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
received 
from 
his
father 
Natasha's 
note 
to 
Princess 
Mary 
breaking 
off 
her 
engagement
(Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
had 
purloined 
it 
from 
Princess 
Mary 
and 
given
it 
to 
the 
old 
prince), 
and 
he 
heard 
from 
him 
the 
story 
of 
Natasha's
elopement, 
with 
additions.

Prince 
Andrew 
had 
arrived 
in 
the 
evening 
and 
Pierre 
came 
to 
see 
him 
next
morning. 
Pierre 
expected<p>
to 
find 
Prince 
Andrew 
in 
almost 
the 
same 
state
as 
Natasha<p>
and 
was 
therefore 
surprised 
on 
entering 
the 
drawing 
room
to 
hear 
him 
in 
the 
study 
talking 
in 
a 
loud 
animated 
voice 
about 
some
intrigue 
going 
on 
in 
Petersburg. 
The 
old 
prince's 
voice 
and 
another 
now
and 
then 
interrupted 
him. 
Princess 
Mary 
came 
out 
to 
meet 
Pierre. 
She
sighed, 
looking 
toward 
the 
door 
of 
the 
room 
where 
Prince<p>
Andrew 
was,
evidently 
intending 
to 
express 
her 
sympathy 
with 
his 
sorrow, 
but 
Pierre
saw 
by 
her 
face 
that 
she 
was 
glad 
both 
at 
what 
had 
happened 
and 
at 
the
way 
her 
brother 
had 
taken 
the 
news 
of 
Natasha's 
faithlessness.

"He 
says 
he 
expected 
it," 
she<p>
remarked. 
"I 
know 
his 
pride 
will 
not 
let
him 
express 
his 
feelings, 
but 
still 
he 
has 
taken 
it 
better, 
far 
better,
than 
I 
expected. 
Evidently 
it 
had 
to 
be...."

"But 
is 
it 
possible 
that 
all 
is 
really 
ended?" 
asked 
Pierre.

Princess 
Mary 
looked 
at 
him 
with 
astonishment. 
She 
did 
not 
understand
how 
he 
could 
ask 
such 
a 
question. 
Pierre 
went 
into 
the 
study. 
Prince
Andrew, 
greatly 
changed 
and 
plainly 
in 
better 
health, 
but 
with 
a 
fresh
horizontal 
wrinkle 
between 
his 
brows, 
stood 
in 
civilian 
dress 
facing
his 
father 
and 
Prince 
Meshcherski, 
warmly 
disputing 
and 
vigorously
gesticulating. 
The 
conversation 
was 
about 
Speranski-the 
news 
of 
whose
sudden 
exile 
and 
alleged 
treachery 
had 
just 
reached 
Moscow.

"Now 
he 
is 
censured<p>
and 
accused 
by 
all 
who 
were 
enthusiastic 
about 
him
a 
month 
ago," 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
saying, 
"and 
by 
those 
who 
were 
unable 
to
understand 
his 
aims.
