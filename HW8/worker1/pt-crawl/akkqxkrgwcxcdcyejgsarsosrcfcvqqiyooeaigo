of

assistants. 
On 
the
square 
in 
front 
of 
the 
Bazaar 
were 
drummers 
beating 
the 
muster 
call.
But 
the 
roll 
of 
the 
drums 
did 
not 
make 
the 
looting 
soldiers<p>
run 
in 
the
direction 
of 
the 
drum 
as 
formerly, 
but 
made 
them, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
run
farther 
away. 
Among 
the 
soldiers 
in 
the 
shops 
and 
passages 
some 
men 
were
to 
be 
seen 
in 
gray 
coats, 
with 
closely 
shaven<p>
heads. 
Two 
officers, 
one
with 
a 
scarf 
over 
his 
uniform 
and 
mounted 
on 
a 
lean, 
dark-gray 
horse,
the 
other 
in 
an 
overcoat 
and 
on 
foot, 
stood 
at 
the 
corner 
of 
Ilyinka
Street, 
talking. 
A 
third 
officer 
galloped 
up 
to 
them.

"The 
general 
orders 
them 
all 
to 
be 
driven 
out 
at 
once, 
without 
fail.
This 
is 
outrageous! 
Half 
the 
men 
have 
dispersed."

"Where 
are 
you 
off 
to?... 
<a href="/cZl/rJ9U3bXmQ1hQrxS.html">Where?..."</a> 
he 
shouted 
to 
three 
infantrymen
without 
muskets 
who, 
holding 
up 
the 
skirts 
of 
their 
overcoats, 
were
slipping 
past 
him 
into 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/aq4oqP3EXJo5td.html">Bazaar</a> 
passage. 
"Stop, 
you 
rascals!"

"But 
how 
are 
you 
going 
to 
stop 
them?" 
replied 
another 
officer. 
"There 
is
no 
getting 
them 
together. 
The 
army 
should 
push 
on 
before 
the 
rest 
bolt,
that's 
all!"

"How 
can 
one 
push 
on? 
They 
are 
stuck 
there, 
wedged 
on 
the 
bridge, 
and
don't 
move. 
Shouldn't 
we 
put 
a 
cordon 
round 
to 
prevent 
the 
rest 
from
running 
away?"

"Come, 
go 
in 
there 
and 
drive 
them 
out!" 
shouted 
the 
senior
