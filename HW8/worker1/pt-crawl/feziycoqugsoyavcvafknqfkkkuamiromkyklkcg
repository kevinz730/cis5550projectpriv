"Are</h1>you 
afraid, 
then?" 
said 
Pierre.

"What 
else 
do 
you 
expect?" 
answered 
the 
soldier. 
"She 
has 
no 
mercy, 
you
know! 
When 
she 
comes 
spluttering 
down, 
out 
go 
your 
innards. 
One 
can't
help 
being 
afraid," 
he 
said 
laughing.

Several 
of 
the 
men, 
with 
bright 
kindly 
faces, 
stopped 
beside 
Pierre.
They 
seemed 
not 
to 
have 
expected 
him 
to 
talk 
like 
anybody 
else, 
and 
the
discovery 
that 
he 
did 
so 
delighted 
them.

"It's<p>
the 
business 
of 
us 
soldiers. 
But 
in 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/fv7H72qsa.html">gentleman</a> 
it's 
wonderful!
There's 
a 
gentleman 
for 
you!"

"To 
your 
places!" 
cried 
the 
young 
officer 
to 
the 
men 
gathered 
round
Pierre.

The 
young 
officer 
was 
evidently 
exercising 
his 
duties 
for 
the 
first 
or
second 
time 
and 
therefore 
treated 
both 
his 
superiors 
and 
the 
men 
with
great 
precision 
and 
formality.

The 
booming 
cannonade 
and 
the 
fusillade 
of 
musketry 
were 
growing 
more
intense 
over 
the 
whole 
field, 
especially 
to 
the 
left 
where 
Bagration's
fleches 
were, 
but 
where 
Pierre 
was 
the 
smoke 
of 
the 
firing 
made 
it
almost 
impossible 
to 
distinguish 
anything. 
Moreover, 
his 
whole
attention 
was 
engrossed 
by 
watching 
the 
family 
circle-separated 
from 
all
else-formed 
by 
the 
men 
in 
the 
battery. 
His 
first 
unconscious 
feeling 
of
joyful 
animation 
produced 
by<p>
the 
sights 
and 
sounds 
of 
the 
battlefield
was 
now 
replaced 
by 
another, 
especially 
since 
he 
had 
seen 
that 
soldier
lying 
alone 
in 
the 
hayfield. 
Now, 
seated 
on 
the 
slope 
of 
the 
trench, 
he
observed 
the 
faces 
of 
those 
around 
him.

By 
ten 
o'clock 
some 
twenty 
men 
had 
already 
been 
carried 
away 
from 
the
battery; 
two 
guns 
were 
smashed 
and 
cannon 
balls 
fell 
more 
and 
more
frequently 
on 
the 
battery 
and 
spent 
bullets 
buzzed 
and 
whistled 
around.
But 
the 
men 
in 
the 
battery 
seemed 
not 
to 
notice 
this, 
and 
merry 
voices
and 
jokes 
were 
heard 
on<p>
all 
sides.

"A 
live 
one!" 
shouted 
a 
man 
as 
a 
whistling 
shell 
approached.

"Not 
this 
way! 
To 
the 
infantry!" 
added 
another 
with 
loud 
laughter,
seeing 
the 
shell 
fly 
past 
and
