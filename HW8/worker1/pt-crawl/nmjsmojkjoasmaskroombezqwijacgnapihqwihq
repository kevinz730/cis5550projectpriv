me<p>
go 
to 
that 
wat?" 
(an 
officer 
nicknamed
"the 
rat") 
he<p>
said, 
rubbing 
his 
forehead 
and 
whole 
face 
with 
both
hands. 
"Just 
fancy, 
he 
didn't 
let 
me 
win 
a 
single 
cahd, 
not 
one
cahd."

He 
took 
the 
lighted 
pipe 
that 
was 
offered 
to 
him, 
gripped 
it 
in 
his
fist,<p>
and 
tapped 
it 
on 
the 
floor, 
making 
the 
sparks 
fly, 
while 
he
continued 
to 
shout.

"He 
lets 
one 
win 
the 
singles 
and 
collahs 
it 
as 
soon 
as 
one 
doubles 
it;
gives 
the 
singles 
and 
snatches 
the 
doubles!"

He 
scattered 
the 
burning 
tobacco, 
smashed 
the 
pipe, 
and 
threw 
it 
away.
Then 
he 
remained 
silent 
for 
a 
while, 
and 
all 
at 
once 
looked 
cheerfully
with 
his 
glittering, 
black 
eyes 
at 
Rostov.

"If 
at 
least 
we 
had 
some 
women 
here; 
but 
there's 
nothing 
foh 
one
to 
do 
but 
dwink. 
If 
we 
could 
only 
get 
to 
fighting 
soon. 
Hullo, 
who's
there?" 
he 
said, 
turning 
to 
the 
door 
as 
he 
heard 
a 
tread 
of 
heavy
boots 
and 
the 
clinking 
of 
spurs 
that 
came 
to 
a 
stop, 
and 
a 
respectful
cough.

"The 
squadron 
quartermaster!" 
said 
Lavrushka.

Denisov's 
face 
puckered 
still 
more.

"Wetched!" 
he 
muttered, 
throwing 
down 
a 
purse 
with 
some 
gold 
in 
it.
"Wostov, 
deah 
fellow, 
just 
see 
how 
much 
there 
is 
left 
and 
shove 
the
purse 
undah 
the 
pillow," 
he 
said, 
and 
went 
out 
to 
the 
quartermaster.

Rostov 
took 
the 
money 
and, 
mechanically 
arranging 
the 
old<p>
and 
new 
coins
in 
separate 
piles, 
began 
counting 
them.

"Ah! 
Telyanin! 
How 
d'ye 
do? 
They 
plucked 
me 
last 
night," 
came
Denisov's 
voice 
from 
the 
next 
room.

"Where? 
At 
Bykov's, 
at 
the 
rat's... 
I 
knew 
it," 
replied 
a 
piping
voice, 
and 
Lieutenant 
Telyanin, 
a 
small 
officer 
of 
the 
same 
squadron,
entered 
the 
room.

Rostov 
thrust 
the 
purse 
under 
the 
pillow 
and 
shook 
the 
damp 
little 
hand
which 
was 
offered 
him. 
Telyanin 
for 
some 
reason 
had 
been 
transferred
from 
the 
Guards 
just 
before 
this 
campaign. 
He 
behaved 
very 
well 
in 
the
regiment 
but 
was 
not 
liked; 
Rostov 
especially 
detested 
him 
and 
was
unable 
to 
overcome 
or 
conceal 
his 
groundless 
antipathy 
to 
the 
man.

"Well, 
young 
cavalryman, 
how 
is 
my 
Rook 
behaving?" 
he 
asked. 
(Rook
was 
a 
young 
horse 
Telyanin 
had 
sold 
to 
Rostov.)

The 
lieutenant 
never 
looked 
the 
man 
he 
was 
speaking 
to 
straight 
in 
the
face; 
his 
eyes 
continually 
wandered 
from 
one 
object 
to 
another.

"I 
saw 
you 
riding 
this 
morning..." 
he 
added.

"Oh, 
he's 
all 
right, 
a 
good 
horse," 
answered 
Rostov, 
though 
the
horse 
for 
which 
he 
had 
paid 
seven 
hundred 
rubbles 
was 
not 
worth 
half
that 
sum. 
"He's<p>
begun 
to 
go 
a 
little 
lame 
on 
the 
left 
foreleg," 
he
added.

"The 
hoof's 
cracked! 
That's 
nothing. 
I'll 
teach 
you 
what 
to 
do
and 
show 
you 
what 
kind 
of 
rivet 
to 
use."

"Yes, 
please 
do," 
said 
Rostov.

"I'll 
show 
you, 
I'll 
show 
you! 
It's 
not 
a 
secret. 
And 
it's 
a
horse 
you'll<p>
thank 
me 
for."

"Then 
I'll 
have 
it 
brought 
round," 
said 
Rostov 
wishing 
to 
avoid
Telyanin, 
and 
he 
went 
out 
to 
give 
the 
order.

In 
the 
passage 
Denisov, 
with 
a 
pipe, 
was 
squatting 
on 
the 
threshold
facing 
the 
quartermaster 
who 
was 
reporting 
to 
him. 
On 
seeing 
Rostov,
Denisov 
screwed 
up 
his 
face 
and 
pointing 
over 
his 
shoulder 
with 
his
thumb 
to 
the 
room 
where 
Telyanin 
was 
sitting, 
he 
frowned 
and 
gave 
a
shudder 
of 
disgust.

"Ugh! 
I 
don't 
like 
that 
fellow," 
he 
said, 
regardless 
of 
the
quartermaster's 
presence.

Rostov 
shrugged 
his 
shoulders 
as 
much 
as 
to 
say: 
"Nor<p>
do 
I, 
but
what's 
one 
to 
do?" 
and, 
having 
given 
his 
order, 
he 
returned 
to
Telyanin.

Telyanin 
was 
sitting 
in 
the 
same 
indolent 
pose 
in 
which 
Rostov 
had
left 
him, 
rubbing 
his 
small 
white 
hands.

"Well 
there 
certainly
