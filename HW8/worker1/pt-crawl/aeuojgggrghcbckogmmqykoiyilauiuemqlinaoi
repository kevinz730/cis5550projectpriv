left 
on 
the

and</h1>again 
went
into 
details 
concerning 
the 
estate 
management, 
asking 
for 
instructions.

"Am 
I<p>
to 
let 
the 
troops 
have 
the 
oats, 
and 
to<p>
take 
a 
receipt 
for 
them?
We 
have 
still 
six 
hundred 
quarters 
left," 
he 
inquired.

"What 
am 
I 
to 
say 
to 
him?" 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
looking 
down 
on 
the
old 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/aYs6UHdX4up8EnBVm.html">man's</a> 
bald 
head 
shining 
in 
the 
sun 
and 
seeing 
by 
the 
expression 
on
his 
face 
that 
the 
old 
man 
himself 
understood 
how<p>
untimely 
such 
questions
were 
and 
only 
asked 
them 
to 
allay 
his 
grief.

"Yes, 
let 
them 
have 
it," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew.

"If 
you 
noticed 
some 
disorder 
in 
the 
garden," 
said 
Alpatych, 
"it 
was
impossible 
to 
prevent 
it. 
Three 
regiments 
have 
been 
here 
and 
spent
the 
night, 
dragoons 
mostly. 
I 
took 
down 
the 
name 
and 
rank 
of 
their
commanding 
officer, 
to 
hand 
in 
a 
complaint 
about 
it."

"Well, 
and 
what 
are<p>
you 
going 
to 
do? 
Will 
you 
stay 
here 
if 
the 
enemy
occupies 
the 
place?" 
asked 
Prince 
Andrew.

Alpatych 
turned 
his 
face 
to 
Prince 
Andrew, 
looked 
at 
him, 
and 
suddenly
with 
a 
solemn 
gesture 
raised 
his 
arm.

"He 
is 
my 
refuge! 
His 
will 
be 
done!" 
he 
exclaimed.

A 
group 
of 
bareheaded 
peasants 
was 
approaching 
across 
the 
meadow 
toward
the 
prince.

"Well, 
good-by!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
bending 
over 
to 
Alpatych. 
"You
must 
go 
away 
too, 
take 
away 
what 
you 
can 
and 
tell 
the 
serfs 
to 
go 
to 
the
Ryazan 
estate 
or 
to 
the 
one 
near 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UMG3t5uq4VWVhi.html">Moscow."

Alpatych</a> 
clung 
to 
Prince 
Andrew's 
leg 
and 
burst 
into 
sobs. 
Gently
disengaging 
himself, 
the 
prince 
spurred 
his 
horse 
and 
rode 
down 
the
avenue 
at 
a 
gallop.

The 
old 
man 
was 
still 
sitting 
in 
the 
ornamental 
garden, 
like 
a 
fly
impassive 
on 
the 
face 
of 
a 
loved 
one 
who 
is 
dead, 
tapping 
the 
last 
on
which 
he 
was 
making 
the 
bast 
shoe, 
and 
two 
little 
girls, 
running 
out
from 
the 
hot 
house 
carrying 
in 
their 
skirts 
plums 
they 
had 
plucked 
from
the 
trees 
there, 
came 
upon 
Prince 
Andrew. 
On 
seeing 
the 
young 
master,
the 
elder 
one 
with 
frightened 
look 
clutched 
her 
younger 
companion 
by 
the
hand 
and 
hid 
with 
her 
behind 
a 
birch 
tree, 
not 
stopping 
to 
pick 
<a href="/aVzUge/XB1ddue81ujvI.html">up</a> 
some
green 
plums 
they 
had 
dropped.

Prince 
Andrew 
turned 
away 
with 
startled 
haste, 
unwilling 
to 
let 
them
see 
that 
they 
had 
been 
observed. 
He 
was 
sorry 
for 
the 
pretty 
frightened
little 
girl, 
was 
afraid 
of 
looking 
at 
her, 
and 
yet 
felt 
an 
irresistible
desire 
to 
do 
so. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tH8CmeS2COCd0dBoY.html">A</a> 
new 
sensation 
of 
comfort 
and 
relief 
came 
over 
him
when, 
seeing 
these 
girls, 
he 
realized 
the 
existence 
of 
other 
human
interests 
entirely 
aloof 
from 
his 
own 
and 
just 
as 
legitimate 
as 
those
that 
occupied 
him. 
Evidently 
these 
girls 
passionately 
desired 
one
thing-to 
carry 
away 
and 
eat 
those 
green 
plums 
without 
being 
caught-and
Prince 
Andrew 
shared 
their 
wish 
for 
the 
success 
of 
their 
enterprise. 
He
could 
not 
resist 
looking 
at 
them 
once 
more. 
Believing 
their 
danger 
past,
they 
sprang 
from 
their 
ambush 
and, 
chirruping 
something 
in 
their 
shrill
little 
voices 
and 
holding 
up 
their 
skirts, 
their 
bare 
little 
sunburned
feet 
scampered 
merrily 
and 
quickly 
across 
the 
meadow 
grass.

Prince 
<a href="/aVzUge/EX9s94vSr.html">Andrew</a> 
was 
somewhat 
refreshed 
by 
having 
ridden 
off 
the 
dusty
highroad 
along 
which
