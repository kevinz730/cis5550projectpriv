need</h1>much 
more 
powerful 
methods. 
It 
is
now 
necessary 
that 
man, 
governed 
by 
his 
senses, 
should 
find 
in 
virtue
a 
charm 
palpable 
to 
those 
senses. 
It 
is 
impossible 
to 
eradicate 
the
passions; 
but 
we 
must 
strive 
to 
direct 
them 
to 
a 
noble 
aim, 
and 
it 
is
therefore 
necessary 
that 
everyone 
should 
be 
able 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hj8EbhW1ej1.html">to</a> 
satisfy 
his 
passions
within 
the 
limits 
of 
virtue. 
Our 
order 
should 
provide 
means 
to 
that 
end.

"As 
soon 
as 
we 
have 
a 
certain 
number 
of 
worthy 
men 
in 
every 
state,
each 
of 
them 
again 
training 
two 
others 
and 
all 
<a href="/cZl/MsT32QJprO1.html">being</a> 
closely 
united,
everything 
will 
be 
possible 
for 
our 
order, 
which 
has 
already 
in 
secret
accomplished 
much 
for 
the 
welfare 
of 
mankind."

This 
speech 
not 
only 
made 
a 
strong 
impression, 
but 
created 
excitement 
in
the 
lodge. 
The 
majority 
of 
the 
Brothers, 
seeing 
in 
it 
dangerous 
designs
of 
Illuminism, 
* 
met 
it 
with 
a 
coldness 
that 
surprised 
Pierre. 
The 
Grand
Master 
began 
answering 
him, 
and 
Pierre 
began 
developing 
his 
views 
with
more 
and 
more 
warmth. 
It 
was 
long 
since 
there 
had 
been 
so 
stormy 
a
meeting. 
Parties 
were 
formed, 
some 
accusing 
Pierre 
of 
Illuminism, 
others
supporting 
him.<p>
At 
that 
meeting 
he 
was 
struck 
for 
the 
first 
time 
by
the 
endless 
variety 
of 
men's 
minds, 
which 
prevents 
a 
truth 
from 
ever
presenting 
itself 
identically 
to 
two 
persons. 
Even 
those 
members
who 
seemed 
to 
be 
on 
his 
side 
understood 
him 
in 
their 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Pw66IgdEd9vE.html">own</a> 
way 
with
limitations 
and 
alterations 
he 
could 
not 
agree 
to, 
as 
what 
he 
always
wanted 
most 
was 
to 
convey 
his 
thought 
to 
others 
just 
as 
he
