not 
possibly 
take 
part 
in 
a 
battle. 
As 
long 
as
Nicholas 
alone 
was 
in 
danger 
the 
countess 
imagined 
that 
she 
loved 
her
first-born 
more 
than 
all 
her 
other 
children 
and 
even 
reproached 
herself
for 
it; 
but 
when 
her 
youngest: 
the 
scapegrace 
who 
had 
been 
bad 
at
lessons, 
was 
always 
breaking 
things 
in 
the 
house 
and 
making 
himself 
a
nuisance 
to 
everybody, 
that 
snub-nosed 
Petya 
with 
his 
merry 
black 
eyes
and 
fresh 
rosy 
cheeks 
where 
soft 
down 
was 
just 
beginning 
to 
show-when
he 
was 
thrown 
amid 
those 
big, 
dreadful, 
cruel 
men 
who 
were 
fighting
somewhere 
about 
something 
and 
apparently 
finding 
pleasure 
in 
it-then
his 
mother 
thought 
she 
loved 
him 
more,<p>
much 
more, 
than 
all 
her 
other
children. 
The 
nearer 
the 
time 
came 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jc5dK2tvJE4FKLE.html">for</a> 
Petya 
to 
return, 
the 
more 
<a href="/aVzUge/Wk68gle0TkvQH.html">uneasy
grew</a> 
the 
countess. 
She 
began 
to 
think 
she 
would 
never 
live 
to 
see 
such
happiness. 
The 
presence 
of 
Sonya, 
of 
her 
beloved 
Natasha, 
or 
even 
of
her 
husband 
irritated 
her. 
"What 
do 
I 
want 
with 
them? 
I 
want<p>
no 
one 
but
Petya," 
she 
thought.

At 
the 
end 
of 
August 
the 
Rostovs 
received 
another 
letter 
from 
<a href="/cZl/lx79pDix5pbE.html">Nicholas.
He</a> 
wrote 
from 
the 
province<p>
of 
Voronezh 
where 
he 
had 
been 
sent 
to 
procure
remounts, 
but 
that 
letter 
did 
not 
set 
the 
countess 
at 
ease. 
Knowing 
that
one 
son 
was 
out 
of 
danger 
she 
became 
the 
more 
anxious 
about 
Petya.

Though 
by 
the 
twentieth 
of 
August 
nearly 
all 
the 
Rostovs' 
acquaintances
had 
left 
Moscow, 
and 
though 
everybody 
tried 
to 
persuade 
the 
countess 
to
get 
away 
as 
quickly<p>
as 
possible, 
she 
would 
not 
hear 
of 
leaving 
before
her 
treasure, 
her 
adored 
Petya, 
returned. 
On 
the 
twenty-eighth 
of 
August
he 
arrived. 
The 
passionate 
tenderness 
with 
which 
his 
mother 
received 
him
did 
not 
please 
the 
sixteen-year-old 
officer. 
Though 
she 
concealed 
from
him 
her 
intention 
of 
keeping 
him 
under 
her 
wing, 
Petya 
guessed 
her
designs, 
and 
instinctively 
fearing 
that 
he 
might 
give 
way 
to 
emotion
when 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Br2GaVr7Ta0.html">with</a> 
her-might 
"become 
womanish" 
as 
he 
termed 
it 
to 
himself-he
treated 
her 
coldly, 
avoided 
her, 
and 
during 
his 
stay 
in 
Moscow 
attached
himself 
exclusively 
to 
Natasha 
for 
whom 
he 
had 
always 
had 
a 
particularly
brotherly 
tenderness, 
almost 
lover-like.

Owing 
to 
the 
count's 
customary 
carelessness 
nothing 
was 
ready 
for 
their
departure
