thinking 
awhile, 
and</h1>then
went 
into 
the 
maids' 
room. 
There 
an 
old 
maidservant 
was 
grumbling 
at
a 
young 
girl 
who 
stood 
panting, 
having 
just 
run 
in 
through 
the 
cold 
from
the 
serfs' 
quarters.

"Stop 
playing-there's 
a 
time 
for 
everything," 
said 
the 
old
woman.

"Let 
her 
alone, 
Kondratevna," 
said 
Natasha. 
"Go, 
Mavrushka,
go."

Having 
released 
Mavrushka, 
Natasha 
crossed 
the 
dancing 
hall 
and 
went
to 
the 
vestibule. 
There 
an 
old 
footman 
and 
two 
young 
ones 
were 
playing
cards. 
They 
broke 
off 
and 
rose 
as 
she 
entered.

"What 
can<p>
I 
do 
with 
them?" 
thought 
Natasha.

"Oh, 
Nikita, 
please 
go... 
where 
can 
I 
send 
him?... 
Yes, 
go 
to 
the
yard 
and 
fetch 
a 
fowl, 
please, 
a 
cock, 
and 
you, 
Misha, 
bring 
me 
<a href="/aVzUge/bj5pWxqu9.html">some
oats."

"Just</a> 
a 
few 
oats?" 
said 
Misha, 
cheerfully 
and 
readily.

"Go, 
go 
quickly," 
the 
old 
man 
urged 
him.

"And 
you, 
Theodore, 
get 
me 
a 
piece 
of 
chalk."

On 
her 
way 
past 
the 
butler's 
pantry 
she 
told 
them 
to 
set 
a 
samovar,
though 
it 
was 
not 
at 
all 
the 
time 
for 
tea.

Foka, 
the 
butler, 
was 
the 
most 
ill-tempered 
person 
in 
the 
house.
Natasha 
liked 
to 
test 
her 
power 
over 
him. 
He 
distrusted 
the 
order 
and
asked 
whether 
the 
samovar 
was 
really 
wanted.

"Oh 
dear, 
what 
a 
young 
lady!" 
said 
Foka, 
pretending 
to 
frown 
at
Natasha.

No 
one 
in 
the 
house 
sent 
people 
about 
or 
gave 
them 
as 
much 
trouble 
as
Natasha 
did. 
She 
could 
not 
see 
people 
unconcernedly, 
but 
had 
to 
send
them 
on 
some 
errand. 
She 
seemed 
to 
be 
trying<p>
whether 
any 
of 
them 
would
get 
angry 
or 
sulky 
with 
her; 
but 
the 
serfs 
fulfilled 
no 
one's 
orders
so 
readily 
as 
they 
did 
hers. 
"What 
can 
I 
do, 
where 
can 
I 
go?"
thought 
she, 
as 
she 
went 
slowly 
along 
the 
passage.

"Nastasya 
Ivanovna, 
what 
sort 
of 
children 
shall 
I 
have?" 
she 
asked
the 
buffoon, 
who 
was 
coming 
toward 
her 
in 
a 
woman's 
jacket.

"Why, 
fleas, 
crickets, 
grasshoppers," 
answered 
the 
buffoon.

"O 
Lord, 
O 
Lord, 
it's 
always 
the 
same! 
Oh, 
where 
am 
I 
to 
go? 
What
am 
I 
to 
do 
with 
myself?" 
And 
tapping 
with 
her 
heels, 
she 
ran 
quickly
upstairs 
to 
see 
Vogel 
and 
his 
wife 
who 
lived 
on 
the 
upper 
story.

Two 
governesses 
were 
sitting 
with 
the 
Vogels 
at 
a 
table, 
on 
which 
were
plates 
of 
raisins, 
walnuts, 
and 
almonds. 
The 
governesses 
were 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oq7hpfx9gJL.html">discussing
whether</a> 
it 
was 
cheaper 
to 
live 
in 
Moscow 
or 
Odessa. 
Natasha 
sat 
down,
listened 
to 
their 
talk 
with 
a 
serious 
and 
thoughtful 
air, 
and 
then 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NY9D9lLv5g.html">got
up</a> 
again.

"The 
island 
of 
Madagascar," 
she 
said, 
"Ma-da-gas-car," 
she
repeated, 
articulating 
each 
syllable 
distinctly, 
and, 
not 
replying<p>
to
Madame 
Schoss 
who 
asked 
her 
what 
she 
was 
saying, 
she 
went 
out 
of 
the
room.

Her 
brother 
Petya 
was 
upstairs 
too; 
with 
the 
man 
in 
attendance 
on 
him
he 
was 
preparing 
fireworks 
to 
let 
off 
that 
night.

"Petya! 
Petya!" 
she 
called 
to 
him. 
"Carry 
me 
downstairs."

Petya 
ran 
up 
and 
offered 
her 
his 
back.<p>
She 
jumped 
on 
it, 
putting 
her
arms 
round 
his 
neck, 
and 
he 
pranced 
along 
with 
her.

"No, 
don't... 
the 
island 
of 
Madagascar!" 
she 
said, 
and 
jumping 
off
his 
back 
she 
went 
downstairs.

Having 
as 
it 
were 
reviewed 
her 
kingdom, 
tested 
her 
power, 
and 
made
sure 
that 
everyone 
was 
submissive, 
but 
that 
all 
the 
same 
it 
was 
dull,
Natasha 
betook 
herself 
to 
the 
ballroom, 
picked 
up 
her 
guitar, 
sat 
down
in 
a 
dark 
corner 
behind 
a 
bookcase, 
and 
began 
to 
run 
her 
fingers 
over
the 
strings 
in 
the 
bass, 
picking 
out 
a 
passage 
she 
<a href="/cZl/FvO6hai1bvg.html">recalled</a> 
from 
an
opera 
she 
had 
heard 
in 
Petersburg 
with 
Prince 
Andrew. 
What 
she 
drew 
from
the 
guitar 
would 
have 
had 
no 
meaning 
for 
other 
listeners, 
but 
in 
her
imagination 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
reminiscences 
arose 
from 
those 
sounds.
She 
sat 
behind 
the 
bookcase 
with 
her 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
a 
streak 
of 
light
escaping 
from 
the 
pantry 
door 
and 
listened 
to 
herself 
and 
pondered. 
She
was 
in 
a 
mood 
for 
brooding 
on 
the 
past.

Sonya 
passed 
to 
the 
pantry 
with 
a 
glass 
in 
her 
hand. 
Natasha 
glanced
at 
her 
and 
at 
the 
crack 
in 
the 
pantry 
door, 
and 
it 
seemed 
to 
her 
that
she 
remembered
