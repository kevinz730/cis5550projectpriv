tells 
me 
he 
never 
met 
a
more 
cunning 
or 
subtle 
diplomatist-you

a 
combination

French
adroitness 
and 
Italian 
play-acting! 
Do 
you 
know 
the 
tale 
about 
him 
and
Count 
Markov? 
Count 
Markov 
was 
the 
only 
man 
who 
knew 
how 
to 
handle
him. 
You 
know 
the 
story 
of 
the 
handkerchief? 
It<p>
is 
delightful!"

And 
the 
talkative 
Dolgorukov, 
turning 
now 
to 
Boris, 
now 
to 
Prince
Andrew, 
told 
how 
Bonaparte 
wishing 
to 
test 
Markov, 
our 
ambassador,
purposely 
dropped 
a 
handkerchief 
in 
front 
of 
him 
and 
stood 
looking
at 
Markov, 
probably 
expecting 
Markov 
to 
pick 
it 
up 
for 
him, 
and 
how
Markov 
immediately 
dropped 
his 
own 
beside 
it 
and 
picked 
it 
up 
without
touching 
Bonaparte's.

"Delightful!" 
said 
Bolkonski. 
"But
