CHAPTER 
XXXVI

Prince 
Andrew's 
regiment 
was 
among 
the 
reserves 
which 
till 
after 
one
o'clock 
were 
stationed 
inactive 
behind 
Semenovsk, 
under 
heavy 
artillery
fire. 
Toward 
two 
o'clock 
the 
regiment, 
having 
already 
lost 
more 
than
two 
hundred 
men, 
was 
moved 
forward 
into 
a 
trampled 
oatfield 
in 
the 
gap
between 
Semenovsk 
and 
the 
Knoll 
Battery, 
where 
thousands 
of 
men 
perished
that 
day 
and 
on 
which 
an 
intense, 
concentrated 
fire 
from 
several 
hundred
enemy 
guns 
was 
directed 
between 
one 
and 
two 
o'clock.

Without 
moving 
from 
that 
spot 
or 
firing 
a 
single 
shot 
the 
regiment 
here
lost 
another 
third 
of 
its 
men. 
From 
in 
front 
and 
especially 
from 
the
right, 
in 
the 
unlifting 
smoke 
the 
guns 
boomed, 
and 
out 
of 
the 
mysterious
domain 
of 
smoke 
that 
overlay 
the 
whole 
space 
in 
front, 
quick 
hissing
cannon 
balls 
and 
slow 
whistling 
shells 
flew 
unceasingly. 
At 
times, 
as
if 
to 
allow 
them 
a 
respite, 
a 
quarter 
of 
an 
hour 
passed 
during 
which
the 
cannon 
balls 
and 
shells 
all 
flew 
overhead, 
but 
sometimes 
several 
men
were 
torn 
from 
the 
regiment 
in 
a 
minute 
and 
the 
slain 
were 
continually
being 
dragged 
away 
and 
the 
wounded 
carried 
off.

With 
each 
fresh 
blow 
less<p>
and 
less 
chance 
of 
life 
remained 
for 
those
