(The 
wheel 
continued 
to 
revolve 
by 
its 
own
impetus, 
and 
Princess 
Mary 
long 
remembered 
the 
dying 
creak 
of 
that
wheel, 
which 
merged 
in 
her 
memory 
with 
what 
followed.)

She 
approached 
him, 
saw 
his 
face, 
and 
something 
gave 
way 
within 
her. 
Her
eyes 
grew 
dim. 
By 
the 
expression 
of 
her 
father's 
face, 
not 
sad, 
not
crushed, 
but 
angry 
and 
working 
unnaturally, 
she 
saw 
that 
hanging 
over
her 
and 
about 
to 
crush 
her<p>
was 
some 
terrible 
misfortune, 
the 
worst
in 
life, 
one 
she 
had 
not 
yet 
experienced, 
irreparable 
and
incomprehensible-the 
death 
of 
one 
she 
loved.

"Father! 
Andrew!"-said 
the 
ungraceful, 
awkward 
princess 
with 
such
an 
indescribable 
charm 
of 
sorrow 
and 
self-forgetfulness 
that 
her 
father
could 
not 
bear 
her 
look 
but 
turned 
away 
with 
a 
sob.

"Bad 
news! 
He's 
not 
among 
the 
prisoners 
nor 
among 
the 
killed!
Kutuzov 
writes..." 
and 
he 
screamed 
as 
piercingly 
as 
if 
he 
wished 
to
drive 
the 
princess 
away 
by 
that 
scream... 
"Killed!"

The 
princess 
did 
not 
fall 
down 
or 
faint. 
She 
was 
already 
pale, 
but 
on
hearing 
these 
words 
her 
face 
changed 
and 
something 
brightened 
in 
her
beautiful, 
radiant 
eyes. 
It 
was 
as 
if 
joy-a 
supreme 
joy 
apart 
from 
the
joys 
and<p>
sorrows 
of 
this 
world-overflowed 
the 
great 
grief 
within 
her.
She 
forgot 
all 
fear 
of 
her 
father, 
went 
up 
to 
him, 
took 
his 
hand, 
and
drawing 
him 
down 
put 
her 
arm 
round 
his 
thin, 
scraggy 
neck.

"Father," 
she 
said, 
"do 
not 
turn 
away 
from 
me, 
let 
us 
weep
together."

"Scoundrels! 
Blackguards!" 
shrieked 
the 
old 
man, 
turning 
his 
face
away 
from 
her. 
"Destroying 
the 
army, 
destroying 
the 
men! 
And 
why? 
Go,
go 
and 
tell 
Lise."

The 
princess 
sank 
helplessly 
into 
an 
armchair 
beside 
her 
father 
and
wept. 
She 
saw 
her 
brother 
now 
as 
he 
had 
been 
at 
the 
moment 
when 
he 
took
leave 
of 
her 
and 
of 
Lise, 
his 
look 
tender 
yet 
proud. 
She 
saw 
him 
tender
and 
amused 
as 
he 
was 
when 
he 
put 
on 
the 
little 
icon. 
"Did 
he 
believe?
Had 
he 
repented 
of 
his 
<a href="/cZl/Zt6JCLL4lmT1jDLTN.html">unbelief?</a> 
Was 
he 
now 
there? 
There 
in 
the 
realms
of 
eternal 
peace 
and 
blessedness?" 
she 
thought.

"Father, 
tell 
me 
how 
it 
happened," 
she 
asked 
through 
her<p>
tears.

"Go! 
Go! 
Killed 
in 
battle, 
where 
the 
best 
of 
<a href="/aVzUge/lv63BnCGW6Lpf.html">Russian</a> 
men 
and
Russia's 
glory 
were 
led 
to 
destruction. 
Go, 
Princess 
Mary. 
Go 
and 
tell
Lise. 
I 
will 
follow."

When 
Princess 
Mary 
returned 
from 
her 
father, 
the 
little 
princess 
sat
working 
and 
looked 
up 
with 
that 
curious 
expression 
of 
inner, 
happy 
calm
peculiar 
to 
pregnant 
women. 
It 
was 
evident 
that 
her 
eyes 
did 
not 
see
Princess 
Mary 
but 
were 
looking 
within... 
into 
herself... 
at 
something
joyful 
and 
mysterious<p>
taking 
place 
within 
her.

"Mary," 
she 
said, 
moving 
away 
from 
the 
embroidery 
frame 
and 
lying
back, 
"give 
me 
your 
hand." 
She 
took 
her 
sister-in-law's 
hand 
and
held 
it 
below 
her 
waist.

Her 
eyes 
were 
smiling 
expectantly, 
her 
downy 
lip 
rose 
and 
remained
lifted 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hO2YWUw3C9.html">in</a> 
childlike 
happiness.

Princess 
Mary 
knelt 
down 
before 
her 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Qb3pAy2w7pVEYz.html">hid</a> 
her 
face 
in 
the 
folds 
of 
her
sister-in-law's 
dress.

"There, 
there! 
Do<p>
you 
feel 
it? 
I 
feel 
so 
strange. 
And 
do 
you 
know,
Mary, 
I 
am 
going 
to 
love 
him 
very 
much," 
said 
Lise, 
looking 
with
bright 
and 
happy 
eyes 
at 
her<p>
sister-in-law.

Mary 
could 
not 
lift
