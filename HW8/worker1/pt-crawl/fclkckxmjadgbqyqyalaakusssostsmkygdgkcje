the 
porter,</h1>who 
had 
followed 
Makar 
Alexeevich, 
stopped 
him
in 
the 
vestibule 
and 
tried 
to 
take 
the 
pistol 
from 
him. 
Pierre, 
coming
out 
into 
the 
corridor, 
looked 
with 
pity 
and 
repulsion 
at 
the 
half-crazy
old 
man. 
Makar 
Alexeevich, 
frowning 
with 
exertion, 
held 
on 
to 
the 
pistol
and 
screamed 
hoarsely, 
evidently 
with 
some 
heroic<p>
fancy 
in 
his 
head.

"To 
arms! 
Board 
them! 
No, 
you 
shan't 
get 
it," 
he 
yelled.

"That 
will 
do, 
please, 
that 
will 
do. 
Have 
the 
goodness-please, 
sir, 
to
let 
go! 
Please, 
sir..." 
pleaded 
Gerasim, 
trying 
carefully 
to 
steer 
Makar
Alexeevich 
by 
the 
elbows 
back 
to 
the 
door.

"Who 
are 
you? 
Bonaparte!..." 
shouted 
Makar 
Alexeevich.

"That's 
not 
right, 
sir. 
Come 
to 
your 
room, 
please, 
and 
rest. 
Allow 
me 
to
have 
the 
pistol."

"Be 
off, 
thou 
base 
slave! 
Touch 
me 
not! 
See 
this?" 
shouted 
Makar
Alexeevich, 
brandishing 
the 
pistol. 
"Board 
them!"

"Catch 
hold!" 
whispered 
Gerasim 
to 
the 
porter.

They 
seized 
Makar 
Alexeevich 
by 
the 
arms 
and 
dragged 
him 
to 
the 
door.

The 
vestibule 
was 
filled 
with 
the 
discordant 
sounds 
of 
a 
struggle 
and 
of
a 
tipsy, 
hoarse 
voice.

Suddenly 
a 
fresh 
sound, 
a 
piercing 
feminine 
scream, 
reverberated 
from
the 
porch 
and 
the 
cook 
came 
running 
into 
the 
vestibule.

"It's 
them! 
Gracious 
heavens! 
O 
Lord, 
four 
of 
them, 
horsemen!" 
she
cried.

Gerasim 
and 
the 
porter 
let 
Makar 
Alexeevich 
go, 
and 
in 
the 
now 
silent
corridor 
the 
sound 
of 
several 
hands 
knocking 
at 
the 
front 
door 
could 
be
heard.

Pierre, 
having 
decided 
that 
until 
he 
had 
carried 
out 
his 
design 
he 
would

neither
