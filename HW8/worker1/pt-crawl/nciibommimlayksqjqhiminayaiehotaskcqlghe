<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UMG3t5uq4VWVhi.html">his</a> 
death.

When 
Michael 
Ivanovich 
went 
in 
there 
were 
tears 
in 
the 
prince's 
eyes
evoked 
by 
the 
memory 
of 
the 
time 
when 
the 
paper 
he 
was 
now 
reading 
had
been 
written. 
He 
took 
the 
letter 
from 
Michael 
Ivanovich's 
hand, 
put 
it
in 
his 
pocket, 
folded 
up 
his 
papers, 
and 
called 
in 
Alpatych 
who 
had 
long
been 
waiting.

The 
prince 
had 
a 
list 
of 
things 
to 
be 
bought 
in 
Smolensk 
and, 
walking
up 
and 
down 
the 
room 
past 
Alpatych 
who 
stood 
by 
the 
door, 
he 
gave 
his
instructions.

"First, 
notepaper-do 
you 
hear? 
Eight 
quires, 
like 
this 
sample,
gilt-edged... 
it 
must 
be 
exactly 
like 
the 
sample. 
Varnish, 
sealing 
wax,
as 
in 
Michael 
Ivanovich's 
list."

He 
paced 
up 
and 
down 
for 
a 
while 
and 
glanced 
<a href="/cZl/tE3iLv7to9sVlKw.html">at</a> 
his 
notes.

"Then 
hand 
to 
the 
governor 
in 
person 
a 
letter 
about 
the 
deed."

Next, 
bolts 
for 
the 
doors 
of 
the 
new 
building 
were 
wanted 
and 
had 
to 
be
of 
a 
special 
shape 
the 
prince 
had 
himself 
designed, 
and 
a 
leather 
case
had 
to 
be 
ordered 
to 
keep 
the 
"will" 
in.

The 
instructions 
to 
Alpatych 
took 
over 
two 
hours 
and 
still 
the 
prince
did 
not 
let 
him 
go. 
He 
sat 
down, 
sank 
into 
thought, 
closed 
his 
eyes, 
and
dozed<p>
off. 
Alpatych 
made 
a 
slight 
movement.

"Well, 
go, 
go! 
If 
anything 
more 
is 
wanted 
I'll 
send 
after 
you."

Alpatych 
went 
out. 
The 
prince 
again 
went 
to 
his 
bureau, 
glanced 
into 
it,
fingered 
his 
papers, 
closed 
the 
bureau 
again, 
and 
sat 
down 
at 
the 
table
to 
write 
to 
the 
governor.

It 
was 
already 
late 
when 
he 
rose 
after 
sealing 
the 
letter. 
He 
wished
to 
sleep, 
but 
he 
knew 
he 
would 
not 
be 
able 
to 
<a href="/aVzUge/oC5mGGRm7vxtj7Qb.html">and</a> 
that 
most 
<a href="/aVzUge/pN4NiMWg9I0.html">depressing
thoughts</a> 
came 
to
