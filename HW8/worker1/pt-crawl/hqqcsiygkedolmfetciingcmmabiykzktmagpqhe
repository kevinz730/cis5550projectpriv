the

angel-as</h1>she
called 
her 
nephew-and 
playing 
with 
him.

Near 
the 
altar 
of 
the 
church 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
there 
<a href="/aVzUge/MK2hBn0t8ZVa.html">was</a> 
a 
chapel 
over 
the
tomb 
of 
the 
little 
princess, 
and 
in 
this 
chapel 
was 
a 
marble 
monument
brought 
from 
Italy, 
representing 
an 
angel 
with<p>
outspread 
wings 
ready 
to
fly 
upwards. 
The 
angel's 
upper 
lip 
was 
slightly 
raised 
as 
though
about 
to 
smile, 
and 
once 
on 
coming 
out 
of 
the 
chapel 
Prince 
Andrew 
and
Princess 
Mary 
admitted 
to 
one 
another 
that 
the 
angel's 
face 
reminded
them 
strangely 
of 
the 
little 
princess. 
But 
what 
was 
still 
stranger,
though 
of 
this 
Prince 
Andrew 
said 
nothing 
to 
his 
sister, 
was 
that 
in 
the
expression 
the 
sculptor 
had 
happened 
to 
give 
the 
angel's 
face, 
Prince
Andrew 
read 
the 
same 
mild 
reproach 
he 
had 
read 
on 
the 
face 
of 
his 
dead
wife: 
"Ah, 
why 
have 
you 
done 
this 
to 
me?"

Soon 
after 
Prince 
Andrew's 
return 
the 
old 
prince 
made 
over 
to 
him 
a
large 
estate, 
Bogucharovo, 
about 
twenty-five 
miles 
from 
Bald 
Hills.
Partly 
because 
of 
the 
depressing 
memories 
associated 
with 
Bald 
Hills,
partly 
because 
Prince 
Andrew 
<a href="/aVzUge/GL6CNkX5CS0ugXx.html">did</a> 
not 
always 
feel 
equal 
to 
bearing 
with
his 
father's 
peculiarities, 
and 
partly 
because 
he 
needed 
solitude,
Prince 
Andrew 
made 
use 
of 
Bogucharovo, 
began 
building 
and 
spent 
most 
of
his 
time 
there.

After 
the 
Austerlitz 
campaign 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
firmly 
resolved 
not
to 
continue 
his 
military 
service, 
and 
when 
the 
war 
recommenced
and 
everybody 
had 
to 
serve, 
he 
took 
a 
post 
under 
his 
father 
in 
the
recruitment 
so 
as 
to 
avoid 
active 
service. 
The 
old 
prince 
and 
his 
son
seemed 
to 
have 
changed 
roles 
since 
the 
campaign 
of 
1805. 
The 
old 
man,
roused 
by 
activity, 
expected 
the 
best 
results 
from 
the 
new 
campaign,
while 
Prince 
Andrew 
on 
the 
contrary, 
taking 
no 
part 
in 
the 
war 
and
secretly 
regretting 
this, 
saw 
only 
the 
dark 
side.

On 
February 
26, 
1807, 
the 
old 
prince 
set 
off 
on 
one 
of 
his 
circuits.
Prince 
Andrew 
remained 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
as 
usual 
during 
his 
father's
absence. 
Little 
Nicholas 
had 
been 
unwell 
for 
four 
days. 
The 
coachman 
who
had 
driven 
the 
old 
prince 
to 
town 
returned 
bringing 
papers 
and 
letters
for 
Prince 
Andrew.

Not 
finding 
the 
young 
prince 
in 
his 
study 
the 
valet 
went 
with 
the
letters 
to 
Princess 
Mary's 
apartments, 
but 
did 
not 
find<p>
him 
there. 
He
was 
told 
that 
the 
prince 
had 
gone 
to 
the 
nursery.

"If 
you 
please, 
your 
excellency, 
Petrusha 
has 
brought 
some 
papers,"
said 
one 
of 
the 
nursemaids 
to 
Prince 
Andrew 
who 
was 
sitting 
on 
a
child's 
little 
chair 
while, 
frowning 
and 
with 
trembling 
hands, 
he
poured 
drops 
from 
a 
medicine 
bottle 
into 
a 
wineglass 
half 
full 
of 
water.

"What 
is 
it?" 
he 
said 
crossly, 
and, 
his 
hand 
shaking
unintentionally, 
he 
poured 
too 
many 
drops 
into 
the 
glass. 
He 
threw 
the
mixture 
onto 
the 
floor 
and 
asked 
for 
some 
more 
water. 
The 
maid 
brought
it.

There 
were 
in 
the 
room 
a 
child's 
cot, 
two 
boxes, 
two 
armchairs, 
a
table, 
a 
child's 
table, 
and 
the 
little 
chair 
on 
which 
Prince 
Andrew
was 
sitting. 
The 
curtains 
were 
drawn, 
and 
a 
single 
candle 
was 
burning 
on
the 
table, 
screened 
by 
a 
bound 
music 
book 
so 
that 
the 
light 
did 
not 
fall
on 
the 
cot.

"My 
dear," 
said 
Princess 
Mary, 
addressing 
her 
brother 
from 
beside
the 
cot 
where 
she 
was 
standing, 
"better 
wait 
a 
bit... 
later..."

"Oh, 
leave 
off, 
you 
always 
talk 
nonsense 
and 
keep 
putting 
things
off-and 
this 
is 
what 
comes 
of 
it!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
in 
an
exasperated 
whisper, 
evidently 
meaning 
to 
wound 
his 
sister.

"My 
dear, 
really... 
it's 
better 
not 
to 
wake 
him... 
he's 
asleep,"
said 
the 
princess 
in 
a 
tone 
of 
entreaty.

Prince 
Andrew 
got 
up 
and 
went 
on 
tiptoe 
up 
to 
the 
little 
bed, 
wineglass
