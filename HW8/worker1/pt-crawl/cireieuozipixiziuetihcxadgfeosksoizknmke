understand 
the 
significance 
of 
these 
events-if 
only 
we
abstain 
from 
attributing 
to 
the 
activity 
<a href="/aVzUge/Gd2ioN4Kzb7qLBzM.html">of</a> 
the 
mass 
aims 
that 
existed
only 
in 
the 
heads 
of 
a 
dozen 
individuals-for 
the 
events 
and 
results 
now
lie 
<a href="/cZl/kz9z45.html">before</a> 
us.

But 
how 
did 
that 
old 
man, 
alone, 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
general 
opinion,
so 
truly 
discern 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
people's 
view 
of 
the 
events 
that
in 
all 
his 
activity 
he 
was 
never 
once 
untrue 
to 
it?

The 
source 
of 
that 
extraordinary 
power 
of 
penetrating 
the 
meaning 
of 
the
events 
then 
occuring 
lay 
in 
the 
national 
feeling 
which 
he 
possessed 
in
full 
purity 
and 
strength.

Only 
the 
recognition 
of 
the 
fact 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/zm71I.html">that</a> 
he 
possessed 
this 
feeling 
caused
the 
people 
in 
so 
strange 
a 
manner, 
contrary 
to 
the 
Tsar's 
wish, 
to
select 
him-an 
old 
man 
in 
disfavor-to 
be 
their 
representative 
in 
the
national 
war. 
And 
only 
that 
feeling 
placed 
him 
on 
that 
highest 
human
pedestal 
from 
which 
he, 
the 
commander 
in 
chief, 
devoted 
all 
his 
powers
not 
to 
slaying 
and 
destroying 
men 
but 
to 
saving 
and 
showing 
pity 
on
them.

That 
simple, 
modest, 
and 
therefore 
truly 
great, 
figure 
could 
not 
be
cast 
in 
the 
false 
mold 
of 
a 
European 
hero-the
