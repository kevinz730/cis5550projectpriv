of 
battle 
with 
the 
pale 
and 
terrified 
Ober-Hofmarschal
Count 
Tolstoy, 
who 
had 
ridden 
out 
to 
the 
battlefield 
with 
others 
in
the 
Emperor's 
suite. 
One 
officer 
told 
Rostov 
that 
he 
<a href="/cZl/Ga6ws1ogilO4rhMF.html">had</a> 
seen 
someone
from 
headquarters 
behind 
the 
village 
to 
the 
left, 
and 
thither 
Rostov
rode, 
not 
hoping 
to 
find 
anyone 
but 
merely 
to 
ease 
his 
conscience. 
When
he 
had 
ridden 
about 
two 
miles 
and 
had 
passed 
the 
last 
of 
the 
Russian
troops, 
he 
saw, 
near 
a 
kitchen 
garden 
with 
a 
ditch 
round 
it, 
two 
men
on 
horseback 
facing 
the 
ditch. 
One 
with 
a 
white 
plume 
in 
his 
hat 
seemed
familiar 
to 
Rostov; 
the 
other 
on 
a 
beautiful 
chestnut 
horse 
(which
Rostov 
fancied 
he 
had 
seen 
before) 
rode 
up 
to 
the 
ditch, 
struck 
his
horse 
with 
his 
spurs, 
and 
giving 
it 
the 
rein 
leaped 
lightly 
over. 
Only
a 
little 
earth 
crumbled 
from 
the 
bank 
under 
the 
horse's 
hind<p>
hoofs.
Turning 
the 
horse 
sharply, 
he 
again 
jumped 
the 
ditch, 
and 
deferentially
addressed 
the 
horseman 
with 
the 
white 
plumes, 
evidently 
suggesting
that 
he 
should 
do 
the 
same. 
The 
rider, 
whose 
figure 
seemed 
familiar
to 
Rostov 
and 
involuntarily 
riveted 
his 
attention, 
made 
a 
gesture 
of
refusal 
with 
his 
head 
and 
hand 
and 
by 
that 
gesture 
Rostov 
instantly
recognized 
his 
lamented 
and 
adored 
monarch.

"But 
it 
can't 
be 
he, 
alone 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
this 
empty 
field!"
thought<p>
Rostov. 
At 
that 
moment 
Alexander 
turned 
his 
head 
and 
Rostov
saw 
the 
beloved 
features 
that 
were 
<a href="/aVzUge/kH5ieWTn1Qc1on.html">so</a> 
deeply 
engraved 
on 
his 
memory. 
The
Emperor 
was 
pale, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/HhG4Uijd0SC.html">his</a> 
cheeks 
sunken 
and 
his 
eyes 
hollow, 
but 
the 
charm,
the 
mildness 
of 
his 
features, 
was 
all 
the 
greater. 
Rostov 
was 
happy
in 
the 
assurance 
that 
<a href="/aVzUge/uqv2NY3epgGc3jl.html">the</a> 
rumors 
about 
the 
Emperor 
being 
wounded 
were
false. 
He 
was 
happy 
to 
be 
seeing 
him. 
He 
knew 
that 
he 
might 
and 
even
ought 
to 
go 
straight 
to 
him 
and 
give 
the 
message 
Dolgorukov 
had 
ordered
him 
to 
deliver.

But 
as 
a 
youth 
in 
love 
trembles, 
is 
unnerved, 
and 
dares 
not 
utter 
<a href="/aVzUge/Gd2ioN4Kzb7qLBzM.html">the
thoughts</a> 
he 
has 
dreamed 
of 
for 
nights, 
but 
looks 
around 
for 
help 
or 
a
chance 
of
