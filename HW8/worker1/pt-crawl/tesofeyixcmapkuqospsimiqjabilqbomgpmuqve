A 
gave 
a 
resultant 
equal 
to 
a 
thousand 
times 
A-the
historian 
is 
again 
obliged 
to 
fall 
back 
on 
power-the 
force 
he 
had
denied-and 
to 
recognize 
it 
as 
the 
resultant 
of 
the 
forces, 
that 
is, 
he
has 
to 
admit 
an 
unexplained 
force 
acting 
on 
the 
resultant. 
And 
that 
is
just 
what 
the 
universal 
historians 
do, 
and 
consequently 
they 
not 
only
contradict 
the 
specialist 
historians 
but 
contradict 
themselves.

Peasants 
having 
no 
clear 
idea 
of 
the 
cause 
of 
rain, 
say, 
according 
to
whether 
they 
want 
rain 
or 
fine 
weather: 
"The 
wind 
has 
blown 
the 
clouds
away," 
or, 
"The 
wind 
has 
brought 
up 
the 
clouds." 
And 
in 
the 
same 
way 
the
universal 
historians 
sometimes, 
when 
it 
pleases 
them 
and 
fits 
in 
with
their 
theory, 
say 
that 
power 
is 
the 
result 
of 
events, 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/RA1HAJD2FWU8mcR.html">sometimes,
when</a> 
they 
want 
to 
prove 
something 
else, 
say 
that 
power 
produces 
events.

A 
third 
class 
of 
historians-the 
so-called 
historians 
of
culture-following 
the 
path 
laid 
down 
by 
the 
<a href="/cZl/al5bOIDr0VWVhi1U.html">universal</a> 
historians 
who
sometimes 
accept 
writers 
and 
ladies 
as 
forces 
producing 
events-again
take 
that 
force 
to 
be 
something 
quite 
different. 
They 
see 
it 
in 
what 
is
called 
culture-in 
mental 
activity.

The 
historians 
of 
culture 
are 
quite 
consistent 
in 
regard 
to 
their
progenitors, 
the 
writers 
of 
universal 
histories, 
for 
if 
historical
events 
may 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
certain 
persons 
treated 
one
another 
in 
such 
and 
such 
ways, 
why 
not<p>
explain 
them 
by 
the 
fact 
that
such 
and 
such 
people 
wrote 
such 
and 
such 
books? 
Of 
the 
immense 
number 
of
indications 
accompanying 
every 
vital 
phenomenon, 
these 
historians 
select
the 
indication 
of 
intellectual 
activity 
and 
say 
that 
this 
indication 
is
the 
cause. 
But 
despite 
their 
endeavors 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
cause 
of 
events
lies 
in 
intellectual 
activity, 
only 
by 
a 
great 
stretch 
can 
one 
admit
that 
there 
is 
any 
connection 
between 
intellectual 
activity 
and 
the
movement
