The 
other
generals, 
however, 
understood 
it</h1>and, 
leaving 
aside 
the 
question 
of
Moscow, 
spoke 
of 
the 
direction 
the 
army 
should 
take 
in 
its 
retreat.
Malasha, 
who 
kept 
her 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
what 
was 
going 
on 
before 
her,
understood 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
council 
differently. 
It 
seemed 
to 
her 
that
it<p>
was 
only 
a 
personal 
struggle 
between 
"Granddad" 
and 
"Long-coat" 
as
she 
termed 
Bennigsen. 
She 
saw 
that 
they 
grew 
spiteful 
when 
they 
spoke 
to
one 
another, 
and 
in 
her 
heart 
she 
sided 
with 
"Granddad."<p>
In 
the 
midst 
of
the 
conversation 
she 
noticed 
"Granddad" 
give 
Bennigsen 
a 
quick, 
subtle
glance, 
and 
then 
to 
her 
joys 
she 
saw 
that 
"Granddad" 
said 
something 
to
"Long-coat" 
which 
settled 
him. 
Bennigsen 
suddenly 
reddened 
and 
paced
angrily 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room. 
What 
so 
affected 
him 
was 
Kutuzov's 
calm
and 
quiet 
comment 
on 
the 
advantage 
or 
disadvantage 
of 
Bennigsen's
proposal 
to<p>
move 
troops 
by 
night 
from 
the 
right 
to 
the 
left 
flank 
to
attack 
the 
French 
right 
wing.

"Gentlemen," 
said 
Kutuzov, 
"I 
cannot 
approve 
of 
the 
count's 
plan. 
Moving
troops 
in 
close 
proximity 
to 
an 
enemy 
is 
always 
dangerous, 
and 
military
history 
supports 
that 
view. 
For 
instance..." 
Kutuzov 
seemed 
to 
reflect,
searching 
for 
an 
example, 
then 
with 
a 
clear, 
naive 
look 
at 
Bennigsen 
he
added: 
"Oh 
yes; 
take 
the 
battle 
of 
Friedland, 
which 
I 
think 
the 
count
well 
remembers, 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/LQ8pDix3OpC0cmeax.html">which</a> 
was... 
not 
fully 
successful, 
only 
because 
our
troops 
were 
rearranged 
too 
near 
the 
enemy...."

There 
followed 
a 
momentary 
pause, 
which 
seemed 
very 
long 
to 
them<p>
all.

The 
discussion 
recommenced, 
but<p>
pauses 
frequently 
occurred 
and 
they 
all
felt 
that 
there 
was 
no 
more 
to 
be 
said.

During 
one 
of 
these 
pauses 
Kutuzov 
heaved 
a 
deep 
sigh 
as 
if 
preparing 
to
speak. 
They 
all 
looked 
at 
him.

"Well, 
gentlemen, 
I 
see 
that 
it 
is 
I 
who 
will 
have 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
broken
crockery," 
said 
he, 
and 
rising 
slowly 
he 
moved 
to 
the 
table. 
"Gentlemen,
I 
have 
heard 
your 
views. 
Some 
of 
you 
will 
not 
agree 
with 
me. 
But 
I," 
he
paused, 
"by 
the 
authority 
entrusted 
to 
me 
by 
my 
Sovereign 
and 
country,
order 
a 
retreat."

After 
that 
the 
generals 
began 
to 
disperse 
with<p>
the 
solemnity 
and
circumspect 
silence 
of 
people 
who 
are 
leaving, 
after 
a 
funeral.

Some 
of 
the 
generals, 
in 
low 
tones 
and 
in 
a 
strain 
very 
different 
from
the 
way 
they<p>
had 
spoken 
during 
the 
council, 
communicated 
something 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UJ1pbE40b.html">to
their</a> 
commander 
in 
chief.

Malasha, 
who 
had 
long 
been 
expected 
for 
supper, 
climbed 
carefully
backwards 
down 
from 
the 
oven, 
her 
bare 
little 
feet 
catching 
at 
its
projections, 
and 
slipping 
between 
the 
legs 
of 
the 
generals 
she 
darted
out 
of 
the 
room.

When 
he 
had 
dismissed 
the 
generals 
Kutuzov 
sat 
a 
long 
time 
with 
his
elbows 
on 
the 
table, 
thinking 
always 
of 
the 
same 
terrible 
question:
"When, 
when 
did 
the 
abandonment 
of 
Moscow 
become 
inevitable? 
When 
was
that 
done 
which 
settled 
the 
matter? 
And 
who 
was 
to 
blame 
for 
it?"

"I 
did 
not 
expect 
this," 
said 
he 
to 
his 
adjutant 
Schneider 
when 
the
latter 
came 
in 
late 
that 
night.<p>
"I 
did 
not 
expect 
this! 
I 
did 
not 
think
this 
would 
happen."

"You 
should 
take 
some 
rest, 
your 
Serene 
Highness," 
replied 
Schneider.

"But 
no! 
They 
shall 
eat 
horseflesh 
yet, 
like 
the 
Turks!" 
exclaimed
Kutuzov 
without 
replying, 
striking 
the 
table
