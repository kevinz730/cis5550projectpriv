suddenly 
cried 
in 
an
agitated<p>
voice,</h1>evidently 
picturing 
vividly 
to 
himself 
from 
Prince
Andrew's 
story 
the 
condition 
Russia 
was 
in. 
"But 
give 
me 
time, 
give 
me
time!" 
he 
said 
with 
a 
grim 
look, 
evidently 
not 
wishing 
to 
continue 
this
agitating 
conversation, 
and 
added: 
"I 
sent 
for 
you 
to 
keep 
you 
with 
me."

"I 
thank 
your 
Serene 
Highness, 
but 
I 
fear 
I 
am 
no 
longer 
fit 
for 
the
staff," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
a 
smile 
which 
Kutuzov 
noticed.

Kutuzov 
glanced 
inquiringly 
at 
him.

"But 
above 
all," 
added 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"I 
have 
grown 
used 
to 
my 
regiment,
am 
fond 
of 
the 
officers, 
and 
I 
fancy 
the 
men 
also 
like 
me. 
I 
should<p>
be
sorry 
to 
leave 
the 
regiment. 
If 
I 
decline 
the 
honor 
of 
being 
with 
you,
believe 
me..."
