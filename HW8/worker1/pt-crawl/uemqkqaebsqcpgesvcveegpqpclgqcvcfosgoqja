retreat 
during 
the 
finest</h1>period 
of 
summer 
and 
with 
sufficient 
supplies
was 
a 
very 
simple 
and 
agreeable 
business.

It 
was 
only 
at 
headquarters 
that 
there 
was 
depression, 
uneasiness, 
and
intriguing; 
in 
the 
body 
of 
the 
army 
they 
did 
not 
ask 
themselves 
where
they 
were 
going 
or 
why. 
If 
they 
regretted 
having 
to 
retreat, 
it 
was 
only
because 
they 
had 
to 
leave 
billets 
they 
had 
grown 
accustomed 
to, 
or 
some
pretty 
young 
Polish 
lady. 
If 
the 
thought 
that 
things 
looked 
bad 
chanced
to 
enter 
anyone's 
head, 
he 
tried 
to 
be 
as 
cheerful 
as 
befits 
a 
good
soldier 
and 
not 
to 
think 
of 
the 
general 
trend 
of 
affairs, 
but 
only 
of
the 
task 
nearest 
to 
hand. 
First 
they 
camped 
gaily 
before 
Vilna, 
making
acquaintance 
with 
the 
Polish 
landowners, 
preparing 
for 
reviews 
and 
being
reviewed 
by 
the 
Emperor 
and 
other 
high 
commanders. 
Then 
came 
an 
order
to 
retreat 
to 
Sventsyani 
and 
destroy 
any 
provisions 
they 
could 
not 
carry
away 
with 
them. 
Sventsyani 
was 
remembered 
by 
the 
hussars 
only 
as 
the
drunken 
camp, 
a 
name 
the 
whole 
army 
gave 
to 
their 
encampment 
there,
and 
because 
many 
complaints 
were 
made 
against 
the 
troops, 
who, 
taking
advantage 
of 
the 
order 
to 
collect 
provisions, 
took 
also 
horses,
carriages, 
and 
carpets 
from 
the 
Polish 
proprietors. 
Rostov 
remembered
Sventsyani, 
because 
on 
the 
first 
day 
of 
their 
arrival 
at 
that 
small 
town
he 
changed 
his 
sergeant 
major 
and 
was 
unable 
to 
manage 
all 
the 
drunken
men 
of 
his 
squadron 
who, 
unknown 
to 
him, 
had 
appropriated 
five 
barrels
of 
old 
beer. 
From 
Sventsyani 
they 
retired 
farther 
and 
farther 
to 
Drissa,
and 
thence 
again 
beyond 
Drissa, 
drawing 
near 
to 
the 
frontier 
of 
Russia
proper.

On 
the 
thirteenth 
of 
July 
the 
Pavlograds 
took 
part 
in 
a 
serious 
action
for 
the 
first 
time.

On 
the 
twelfth 
of 
July, 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
that 
action, 
there 
was 
a 
heavy
storm 
of 
rain 
and 
hail. 
In 
general, 
the 
summer 
of 
1812 
was 
remarkable
for 
its 
storms.

The 
two 
Pavlograd 
squadrons 
were 
bivouacking 
on 
a 
field 
of 
rye, 
which
was 
already 
in 
ear 
but 
had 
been 
completely 
trodden 
down 
by 
cattle 
and
horses. 
The 
rain 
was 
descending 
in 
torrents, 
and 
Rostov, 
with 
a 
young
officer 
named 
Ilyin, 
his 
protege, 
was 
sitting 
in 
a 
hastily 
constructed
shelter. 
An 
officer 
of 
their 
regiment, 
with 
long 
mustaches 
extending
onto 
his 
cheeks, 
who 
after 
riding 
to 
the 
staff 
had 
been 
overtaken 
by 
the
rain, 
entered 
Rostov's 
shelter.

"I 
have 
come 
from 
the 
staff, 
Count. 
Have 
you 
heard 
of 
Raevski's
exploit?"

And 
the 
officer 
gave 
them 
details 
of 
the 
Saltanov 
battle, 
which 
he 
had
heard 
at 
the 
staff.

Rostov, 
smoking 
his 
pipe 
and 
turning 
his 
head 
about 
as<p>
the 
water
trickled 
down 
his 
neck, 
listened 
inattentively, 
with 
an 
occasional
glance 
at 
Ilyin, 
who 
was 
pressing 
close 
to 
him. 
This 
officer, 
a 
lad
of 
sixteen 
who 
had 
recently 
joined 
the 
regiment, 
was 
now 
in 
the 
same
relation 
to 
Nicholas 
that 
Nicholas 
had 
been 
to 
Denisov 
seven 
years
before. 
Ilyin 
tried 
to 
imitate 
Rostov 
in 
everything<p>
and 
adored 
him 
as 
a
girl 
might 
have 
done.

Zdrzhinski, 
the 
officer 
with 
the 
long 
mustache, 
spoke 
grandiloquently 
of
the 
Saltanov 
dam 
being 
"a 
Russian 
Thermopylae," 
and 
of 
how 
a 
deed 
worthy
of 
antiquity 
had 
been 
performed 
by 
General 
Raevski. 
He 
recounted 
how
Raevski 
had 
led 
his 
two 
sons 
onto 
the 
dam 
under 
terrific 
fire 
and 
had
charged 
with 
them 
beside 
him. 
Rostov 
heard 
the 
story 
and 
not 
only 
said
nothing 
to 
encourage 
Zdrzhinski's 
enthusiasm 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary,
looked 
like 
a 
man 
ashamed 
of 
what 
he 
was 
hearing, 
though 
with 
no
intention 
of 
contradicting 
it. 
Since 
the 
campaigns 
of 
Austerlitz 
and
of 
1807 
Rostov 
knew 
by 
experience 
that 
men 
always 
lie 
when 
describing
military 
exploits, 
as 
he 
himself 
had 
done 
when 
recounting 
them; 
besides
that, 
he 
had 
experience 
enough 
to 
know 
that 
nothing 
happens 
in 
war 
at
all 
as 
we 
can 
imagine 
or 
relate 
it. 
And 
so 
he 
did 
not 
like 
Zdrzhinski's
tale, 
nor 
did 
he 
like 
Zdrzhinski 
himself 
who, 
with 
his
