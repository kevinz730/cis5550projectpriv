"But 
I 
never 
said 
a 
word 
about 
the 
Emperor!" 
said 
the 
officer,
justifying 
himself, 
and 
unable 
to 
understand 
Rostov's 
outburst,
except 
on 
the 
supposition 
that 
he 
was 
drunk.

But 
Rostov 
did 
not 
listen 
to 
him.

"We 
are 
not 
diplomatic 
officials, 
we 
are 
soldiers 
and 
nothing 
more,"
he 
went 
on. 
"If 
we 
are 
ordered 
to 
die, 
we 
must<p>
die. 
If 
we're
punished, 
it 
means 
that 
we 
have 
deserved 
it, 
it's 
not 
for 
us 
to 
judge.
If 
the 
Emperor 
pleases 
to 
recognize 
Bonaparte 
as 
Emperor 
and 
to 
conclude
an 
alliance 
with 
him, 
it 
means 
that 
that 
is<p>
the 
right<p>
thing 
to 
do. 
If
once 
we 
begin 
judging 
and 
arguing 
about 
everything, 
nothing 
sacred
will 
be 
left! 
That 
way 
we 
shall 
be 
saying 
there 
is 
no 
God-nothing!"
shouted 
Nicholas, 
banging 
the 
table-very 
little 
to 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/EY78hoZsa0.html">point</a> 
as 
it
seemed 
to 
his 
listeners, 
but 
quite 
relevantly 
to 
the 
course 
of 
his 
own
thoughts.

"Our 
business 
is 
to 
do 
our 
duty, 
to 
fight 
and 
not 
to 
think! 
That's
all...." 
said 
he.

"And 
to 
drink," 
said 
one 
of 
the 
officers, 
not 
wishing 
to 
quarrel.

"Yes, 
and 
to 
drink," 
assented 
Nicholas. 
"Hullo 
there! 
Another
bottle!" 
he 
shouted.

In 
1808 
the 
Emperor 
Alexander 
went 
to 
Erfurt 
for 
a 
fresh 
interview 
with
the 
Emperor 
Napoleon, 
and 
in 
the 
upper

of

there 
was
much 
talk 
of 
the 
grandeur 
of 
this
