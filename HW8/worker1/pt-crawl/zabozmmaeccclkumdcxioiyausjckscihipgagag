Prince 
Andrew 
knew 
how 
to 
take</h1>his 
stand 
so 
that 
they 
respected 
and 
even
feared 
him.

Coming 
out 
of 
Kutuzov's 
room 
into 
the 
waiting 
room 
with 
the 
papers 
in
his 
hand 
Prince 
Andrew 
came 
up 
to 
his 
comrade, 
the 
aide-de-camp 
on 
duty,
Kozlovski, 
who 
was 
sitting 
at 
the 
window<p>
with 
a 
book.

"Well, 
Prince?" 
asked 
Kozlovski.

"I 
am 
ordered 
to 
write 
a 
memorandum 
explaining 
why 
we 
are 
not
advancing."

"And 
why 
is 
it?"

Prince 
Andrew 
shrugged 
his 
shoulders.

"Any 
news 
from 
Mack?"

"No."

"If 
it 
were 
true 
that<p>
he 
has 
been 
beaten, 
news 
would 
have 
come."

"Probably," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
moving 
toward 
the 
outer 
door.

But 
at 
that 
instant 
a 
tall 
Austrian 
general 
in 
a 
greatcoat, 
with 
the
order 
of 
Maria 
Theresa 
on 
his 
neck 
and 
a 
black 
bandage 
round 
his 
head,
who 
had 
evidently 
just 
arrived, 
entered 
quickly, 
slamming 
the 
door.
Prince 
Andrew 
stopped 
short.

"Commander 
in 
Chief 
Kutuzov?" 
said 
the 
newly 
arrived 
general
speaking 
quickly 
with 
a 
harsh 
German 
accent, 
looking 
to 
both 
sides 
and
advancing 
straight 
toward 
the 
inner 
door.

"The 
commander 
in 
chief 
is 
engaged," 
said 
Kozlovski, 
going
hurriedly 
up 
to 
the 
unknown 
general 
and 
blocking 
his 
way 
to 
the 
door.
"Whom 
shall 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/MjR1AXsTm93eI.html">I</a> 
announce?"

The 
unknown 
general 
looked<p>
disdainfully 
down 
at 
Kozlovski, 
who 
was
rather 
short, 
as 
if 
surprised 
that 
anyone 
should 
not 
know 
him.

"The 
commander 
in 
chief 
is 
engaged," 
repeated 
Kozlovski 
calmly.

The 
general's 
face 
clouded, 
his 
lips 
quivered 
and 
trembled. 
He 
took
out 
a 
notebook, 
hurriedly 
scribbled 
something 
in 
pencil, 
tore 
out<p>
the
leaf, 
gave 
it 
to 
Kozlovski, 
stepped 
quickly 
to 
the 
window, 
and 
threw
himself 
into 
a 
chair, 
gazing 
at 
those 
in 
the 
room 
as 
if 
asking, 
"Why
do 
they 
look 
at 
me?" 
Then 
he 
lifted 
his 
head, 
stretched 
his 
neck 
as
if 
he 
intended 
to 
say 
something, 
but 
immediately, 
with 
affected
indifference, 
began 
to 
hum 
to 
himself, 
producing 
a 
queer 
sound 
which
immediately 
broke 
off. 
The 
door 
of 
the 
private 
room 
opened 
and 
Kutuzov
appeared 
in 
the 
doorway. 
The 
general 
with 
the 
bandaged 
head 
bent 
forward
as 
though 
running 
away 
from 
some 
danger, 
and, 
making 
long, 
quick 
strides
with 
his 
thin 
legs, 
went 
up 
to 
Kutuzov.

"Vous 
voyez 
le 
malheureux 
Mack," 
he 
uttered 
in 
a 
broken 
voice.

Kutuzov's 
face 
as 
he 
stood 
in 
the 
open 
doorway 
remained 
perfectly
immobile 
for 
a<p>
few 
moments. 
Then 
wrinkles 
ran 
over 
his 
face 
like 
a 
wave
and 
his 
forehead 
became 
smooth 
again, 
he 
bowed 
his 
head 
respectfully,
closed 
his 
eyes, 
silently 
let 
Mack 
enter 
his 
room 
before 
him, 
and 
closed
the 
door 
himself 
behind 
him.

The 
report 
which 
had 
been 
circulated 
that 
the 
Austrians 
had 
been 
beaten
and 
that 
the 
whole 
army 
had 
surrendered 
at 
Ulm 
proved 
to 
be 
correct.
Within 
half 
an 
hour 
adjutants 
had 
been 
sent 
in 
various 
directions 
with
orders 
which 
showed 
that 
the 
Russian 
troops, 
who 
had 
hitherto 
been
inactive, 
would 
also 
soon 
have 
to 
meet 
the 
enemy.

Prince 
Andrew 
was 
one 
of 
those 
rare 
staff 
officers 
whose 
chief 
interest
lay 
in 
the 
general 
progress 
of 
the 
war. 
When 
he 
saw 
Mack 
and 
heard 
the
details 
of 
his 
disaster<p>
he 
understood 
that 
half 
the 
campaign 
was 
lost,
understood 
all 
the 
difficulties 
of 
the 
Russian 
army's 
position, 
and
vividly 
imagined 
what 
awaited 
it 
and 
the 
part 
he 
would 
have 
to
play. 
Involuntarily 
he 
felt 
a 
joyful 
agitation 
at 
the 
thought 
of 
the
humiliation 
of 
arrogant 
Austria 
and 
that 
in 
a 
week's 
time 
he 
might,
perhaps, 
see 
and 
take 
part 
in 
the 
first 
Russian 
encounter 
with 
the
French 
since 
Suvorov 
met 
them. 
He 
feared 
that 
Bonaparte's 
genius
might 
outweigh 
all 
the 
courage 
of 
the 
Russian 
troops, 
and 
at 
the 
same
time 
could 
not 
admit 
the 
idea 
of 
his 
hero 
being 
disgraced.

Excited 
and 
irritated 
by 
these 
thoughts 
Prince 
Andrew 
went 
toward 
his
room 
to 
write 
to 
his 
father, 
to 
whom 
he 
wrote
