Thiers, 
narrating 
this 
episode.</h1>In
reality 
Lavrushka, 
having 
got 
drunk 
the 
day 
before 
and 
left 
his 
master
dinnerless, 
had 
been 
whipped 
and 
sent 
to 
the 
village 
in 
quest 
of
chickens, 
where 
he 
engaged 
in 
looting 
till 
the 
French 
took 
him 
prisoner.
Lavrushka 
was 
one 
of 
those 
coarse, 
bare-faced 
lackeys 
who 
have 
seen 
all
sorts 
of 
things, 
consider 
it 
necessary 
to 
do 
everything 
in 
a 
mean 
and
cunning 
way, 
are 
ready 
to 
render 
any 
sort 
of 
service 
to 
their 
master,
and 
are 
keen 
at 
guessing 
their 
master's 
baser 
impulses, 
especially 
those
prompted 
by 
vanity 
and 
pettiness.

Finding 
himself 
in 
the 
company 
of 
Napoleon, 
whose 
identity 
he 
had 
easily
and 
surely 
recognized, 
Lavrushka 
was 
not 
in 
the 
least 
abashed 
but 
merely
did 
his 
utmost 
to 
gain 
his 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/CX30.html">new</a> 
master's 
favor.

He 
knew 
very 
well 
that 
this 
was 
Napoleon, 
but 
Napoleon's 
presence 
could
no 
more 
intimidate 
him 
than 
Rostov's, 
or 
a 
sergeant 
major's 
with 
the
rods, 
would 
have 
done, 
for 
he 
had 
nothing 
that 
either 
the 
sergeant 
major
or 
Napoleon 
could 
deprive 
him 
of.

So 
he 
rattled 
on, 
telling 
all 
the 
gossip 
he 
had 
heard 
among 
the
orderlies. 
Much 
of 
it 
true. 
But 
when 
Napoleon 
asked 
him 
whether 
the
Russians 
thought 
they 
would 
beat 
Bonaparte<p>
or 
not, 
Lavrushka 
screwed 
up
his 
eyes 
and 
considered.

In 
this 
question 
he 
saw 
subtle 
cunning, 
as 
men 
of 
his 
type 
see 
cunning
in 
everything, 
so 
he 
frowned 
and 
did 
not 
answer 
immediately.

"It's 
like 
this," 
he 
said 
thoughtfully, 
"if 
there's 
a 
battle 
soon, 
yours
will 
win. 
That's 
right. 
But 
if 
three 
days 
pass, 
then 
after 
that, 
well,
then 
that 
same 
battle 
will 
not 
soon 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/pb9epgGc7M7G.html">be</a> 
over."

Lelorgne 
d'Ideville 
smilingly 
interpreted 
this 
speech 
to 
Napoleon 
thus:
"If 
a 
battle 
takes 
place 
within 
the 
next 
three 
days 
the 
French 
will
win, 
but<p>
if 
later, 
God 
knows 
what 
will 
happen." 
Napoleon 
did 
not 
smile,
though 
he 
was 
evidently 
in 
high 
good 
humor, 
and 
he 
ordered 
<a href="/cZl/pM8O1Xs.html">these</a> 
words
to 
be 
repeated.

Lavrushka 
noticed 
this 
and 
to 
entertain 
him 
further, 
pretending 
not 
to
know 
who 
Napoleon 
was, 
<a href="/cZl/Im8jbFN5O6ACoNJ.html">added:

"We</a> 
know 
that 
you 
have 
Bonaparte 
and 
that 
he 
has 
beaten 
everybody 
in 
the
world, 
but 
we 
are 
a 
different 
matter..."-without 
knowing 
why 
or 
how 
this
bit 
of 
boastful 
patriotism<p>
slipped 
out 
at 
the 
end.

The 
interpreter 
translated 
these 
words 
without 
the 
last 
phrase, 
and
Bonaparte 
smiled. 
"The 
young 
Cossack 
made 
his 
mighty 
interlocutor
smile," 
says 
Thiers. 
After 
riding 
a 
few 
paces 
in 
silence, 
Napoleon
turned 
to 
Berthier 
and 
said 
he 
wished 
to 
see 
how 
the 
news 
that 
he 
was
talking 
to 
the 
Emperor 
himself, 
to 
that
