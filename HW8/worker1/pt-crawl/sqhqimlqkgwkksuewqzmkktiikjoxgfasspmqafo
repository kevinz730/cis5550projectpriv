Pfuel,

merely

no

all

Another 
who

gain 
some 
advantage 
would 
attract 
the 
Emperor's<p>
attention 
by 
loudly
advocating 
the 
very 
thing 
the 
Emperor 
had 
hinted 
at 
the 
day 
before,
and 
would 
dispute 
and 
shout 
at 
the 
council, 
beating 
his 
breast 
and
challenging<p>

who 
did

proving

he 
was

in 
the

of 
opponents, 
between 
two 
councils

simply 
solicit
a 
special 
gratuity 
for 
his 
faithful 
services, 
well 
knowing 
that

people 
would 
be 
too 
busy

refuse
