Natasha</h1>who 
had 
just 
passed 
him 
in 
the 
ballroom 
with
such 
a 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Lx6GyPl1ZMYAE3yG.html">look</a> 
of 
cold 
dignity. 
He 
did 
not 
know 
that 
Natasha's 
soul 
was
overflowing 
with 
despair, 
shame, 
and 
humiliation, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
not
her 
fault 
that 
her 
face 
happened 
to 
assume 
an 
expression 
of 
calm 
dignity
and 
severity.

"But 
how 
get 
married?" 
said 
Pierre, 
in 
answer 
to 
Marya 
Dmitrievna. 
"He
could 
not 
marry-he 
is 
married!"

"Things 
get 
worse 
from 
hour 
to 
hour!" 
ejaculated 
Marya 
Dmitrievna. 
"A
nice 
youth! 
What 
a 
scoundrel! 
And 
she's 
expecting 
him-expecting 
him
since 
yesterday. 
She 
must 
be 
told! 
Then 
at 
least 
she 
won't 
go 
on
expecting 
him."

After 
hearing 
the 
details<p>
of 
Anatole's 
marriage 
from 
Pierre, 
and 
giving
vent 
to 
her 
anger 
against 
Anatole 
in 
words 
of 
abuse, 
Marya 
Dmitrievna
told 
Pierre 
why 
she 
had 
sent 
for 
him. 
She 
was 
afraid 
that 
the 
count 
or
Bolkonski, 
who 
might 
arrive 
at 
any 
moment, 
if 
they 
knew 
of 
this 
affair
(which 
she 
hoped 
to 
hide 
from 
them) 
might 
challenge 
Anatole 
to 
a 
duel,
and 
she 
therefore 
asked 
Pierre 
to 
tell 
his 
brother-in-law 
in 
her 
name 
to
leave 
Moscow 
and 
not 
dare 
to 
let 
her 
set 
eyes 
on 
him 
again. 
Pierre-only
now 
realizing 
the 
danger 
to 
the 
old 
count, 
Nicholas, 
and 
Prince
Andrew-promised 
to 
do 
as 
she 
wished. 
Having 
briefly 
and 
exactly
explained 
her 
wishes 
to 
him, 
she 
let 
him 
go 
to 
the 
drawing 
room.

"Mind, 
the 
count 
knows 
nothing. 
Behave 
as 
if 
you 
know 
nothing 
either,"
she 
said. 
"And 
I 
will 
go 
and 
tell 
her 
it 
is 
no 
use 
expecting 
him! 
And
stay 
to 
dinner 
if 
you 
care 
to!" 
she 
called 
after 
Pierre.

Pierre 
met 
the 
old 
count, 
who 
seemed 
nervous 
and 
upset. 
That 
morning
Natasha 
had 
told 
him 
that 
she 
had 
rejected 
Bolkonski.

"Troubles, 
troubles, 
my 
dear 
fellow!" 
he 
said 
to 
Pierre. 
"What 
troubles
one 
has 
with 
these 
girls 
without 
their 
mother! 
I 
do 
so 
regret 
having
come 
here.... 
I 
will 
be 
frank 
with 
you. 
Have 
you 
heard 
she 
has<p>
broken
off 
her 
engagement 
without 
consulting 
anybody? 
It's 
true 
this 
engagement
never 
was 
much 
to 
my 
liking. 
Of 
course 
he 
is 
an 
excellent 
man, 
but
still, 
with 
his 
father's 
disapproval 
they 
wouldn't 
have 
been 
happy, 
and
Natasha 
won't 
lack 
suitors. 
Still, 
it 
has 
been 
going 
on 
so 
long, 
and
to 
take 
such 
a 
step 
without 
father's<p>
or 
mother's 
consent! 
And 
now 
she's
ill, 
and 
God 
knows 
what! 
It's 
hard, 
Count, 
hard 
to 
manage 
daughters 
in
their 
mother's 
absence...."

Pierre 
saw 
that 
the 
count 
was 
much 
upset 
and 
tried 
to 
change 
the
subject, 
but 
the 
count 
returned 
to 
his 
troubles.

Sonya 
entered 
the 
room 
with 
an 
agitated 
face.

"Natasha 
is 
not 
quite 
well; 
she's 
in 
her 
room 
and 
would 
like 
to 
see 
you.
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
is 
with 
her 
and 
she 
too 
asks 
you 
to 
come."

"Yes, 
you 
are 
a 
great 
friend 
of 
Bolkonski's, 
no 
doubt 
she 
wants 
to 
send
him 
a 
message," 
said 
the 
count. 
"Oh 
dear! 
Oh 
dear! 
How 
happy 
it 
all
was!"

And 
clutching 
the 
spare 
gray 
locks 
on 
his 
temples 
the 
count 
left 
<a href="/cZl/vwO3AzQCY4xLYdP.html">the
room.

When</a> 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
told 
Natasha 
that 
Anatole 
was 
married, 
Natasha
did 
not 
wish 
to 
believe 
it 
and 
insisted 
on 
having 
it 
confirmed 
by 
Pierre
himself. 
Sonya 
told 
Pierre 
this 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Dt17xHdu3.html">as</a> 
she 
led 
him 
along 
the 
corridor 
to
Natasha's 
room.

Natasha, 
pale 
and 
stern, 
was 
sitting 
beside 
Marya 
Dmitrievna, 
and 
her
eyes, 
glittering 
feverishly, 
met 
Pierre 
with 
a 
questioning 
look 
the
moment 
he 
entered. 
She 
did 
not 
smile 
or 
nod, 
but 
only 
gazed 
fixedly 
at
him, 
and 
her 
look 
asked 
only 
one 
thing: 
was 
he 
a 
friend, 
or 
like 
the
others 
an 
enemy 
in 
regard 
to 
Anatole? 
As 
for 
Pierre, 
he 
evidently 
did
not 
exist 
for 
her.

"He 
knows 
all 
about 
it," 
said 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
pointing 
to 
Pierre 
and
addressing 
Natasha. 
"Let 
him 
tell 
you 
whether 
I 
have 
told 
the 
truth."

Natasha 
looked<p>
from 
one 
to 
the 
other 
as 
a 
hunted 
and 
wounded 
animal
looks 
at 
the 
approaching
