brought
word</h1>from 
the 
princess 
that 
she 
would 
be 
very 
glad 
to 
see 
Pierre 
if 
he
would 
excuse 
her 
want 
of 
ceremony 
and 
come 
upstairs 
to 
her 
apartment.

In 
a 
rather 
low 
room 
lit 
by 
one 
candle 
sat 
the 
princess 
and 
with 
her
another 
person 
dressed 
in 
black. 
Pierre 
remembered 
that 
the 
princess
always 
had 
lady 
companions, 
but 
who 
they 
were 
and 
what 
they 
were 
like
he 
never 
knew 
<a href="/cZl/Ri5U63U.html">or</a> 
remembered. 
"This 
must 
be 
one 
of 
her 
companions," 
he
thought, 
glancing 
at 
the 
lady 
in 
<a href="/cZl/kt2kz2w9dJM.html">the</a> 
black 
dress.

The 
princess 
rose 
quickly 
to 
meet 
him 
and 
held 
out 
her 
hand.

"Yes," 
she 
said, 
looking 
at 
his 
altered 
face 
after 
he 
had 
kissed 
her
hand, 
"so 
this 
is 
how 
we 
meet 
again. 
He 
spoke 
of 
you 
even 
at 
the 
very
last," 
she 
went 
on, 
turning 
her 
eyes 
from 
Pierre 
to 
her 
companion 
with 
a
shyness 
that 
surprised 
him 
for 
an 
instant.

"I 
was 
so 
glad 
to 
hear 
of 
your<p>
safety. 
It 
was 
the 
first 
piece 
of 
good
news 
we 
had 
received 
for 
a 
long 
time."

Again 
the 
princess 
glanced 
round 
at 
her 
companion 
with 
even 
more
uneasiness 
in 
her 
manner 
and 
was 
about 
to 
add 
something, 
but 
Pierre
interrupted 
her.

"Just 
imagine-I 
knew 
nothing 
about 
him!" 
said 
he. 
"I 
thought 
he 
had 
been
killed. 
All 
I 
know 
I 
heard 
at 
second 
hand 
from 
others. 
I 
only 
know 
that
he 
fell 
in 
with 
the 
Rostovs.... 
What 
a 
strange 
coincidence!"

Pierre 
spoke 
rapidly 
and 
with 
animation. 
He 
glanced 
once 
at 
the
companion's 
face, 
saw 
her 
attentive 
and 
kindly 
gaze 
fixed 
on 
him, 
and,
as 
often 
happens 
when 
one 
is 
talking, 
felt 
somehow 
that 
this 
companion
in 
the 
black 
dress 
was 
a 
good, 
kind, 
excellent 
creature 
who 
would 
not
hinder 
his 
conversing 
freely 
with 
Princess 
Mary.

But 
when 
he 
mentioned 
the 
Rostovs, 
Princess 
Mary's 
face 
expressed 
still
greater 
embarrassment. 
She 
again 
glanced 
rapidly 
from 
Pierre's 
face 
to
that 
of 
the 
lady 
in 
the 
black 
dress 
and 
said:

"Do 
you 
really 
not 
recognize 
her?"

Pierre 
looked 
again 
at 
the 
companion's 
pale, 
delicate 
face 
with 
its
black 
eyes 
and 
peculiar 
mouth, 
and 
something 
near 
to 
him, 
long 
forgotten
and 
more 
than 
sweet, 
looked 
at 
him 
from 
those 
attentive 
eyes.

"But 
no, 
it 
can't 
be!" 
he 
thought. 
"This 
stern, 
thin, 
pale 
face 
that
looks 
so 
much 
older! 
It 
cannot 
<a href="/cZl/CM9vGX9bf1.html">be</a> 
she. 
It 
merely 
reminds 
me 
of 
her."
But 
at 
that 
moment 
Princess 
Mary 
said, 
"Natasha!" 
And 
with 
difficulty,
effort, 
and 
stress, 
like 
the 
opening 
of 
a 
door 
grown 
rusty 
on 
its
hinges, 
a 
smile 
appeared 
on 
the 
face 
with 
the 
attentive 
eyes, 
and 
from
that 
opening 
door 
came 
a 
breath 
of 
fragrance 
which 
suffused 
Pierre 
with
a 
happiness 
he 
had 
long 
forgotten 
and 
<a href="/cZl/up4Xs5AF1tTZW.html">of</a> 
which 
he 
had 
not 
even 
been
thinking-especially 
at 
that 
moment. 
It 
suffused 
him, 
seized 
him, 
and
enveloped 
him 
completely. 
When 
she 
smiled 
doubt 
was 
no 
longer 
possible,
it 
was 
Natasha 
and 
he 
loved 
her.

At 
that 
moment 
Pierre 
involuntarily 
betrayed 
to 
her, 
to 
Princess 
Mary,
and 
above 
all 
to 
himself, 
a 
secret 
of 
which 
he 
himself 
had 
been 
unaware.
He 
flushed 
joyfully 
yet 
with 
painful 
distress. 
He 
tried 
to 
hide 
his
agitation. 
But 
the 
more 
he 
tried 
to 
hide 
it 
the 
more 
clearly-clearer
than 
any 
words 
could 
have 
done-did 
he 
betray 
to 
himself, 
to 
her, 
and 
to
Princess 
Mary 
that 
he 
loved 
her.

"No, 
it's 
only 
the 
unexpectedness 
of 
it," 
thought 
Pierre. 
But 
as 
soon 
as
he 
tried 
to 
continue 
the 
conversation 
he 
had 
begun 
with 
Princess 
Mary 
he
again 
glanced 
at 
Natasha, 
and 
a 
still-deeper 
flush 
suffused 
his 
face 
and
a 
still-stronger 
agitation 
of 
mingled 
joy 
and 
fear 
seized 
his 
<a href="/aVzUge/Gd2ioN4Kzb7qLBzM.html">soul.</a> 
He
became 
confused 
in 
his 
speech 
and 
stopped 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
what 
he 
was
saying.

Pierre 
had 
failed 
to 
notice 
Natasha 
because 
he 
did 
not 
at 
all 
expect 
to
see 
her 
there, 
but 
he 
had 
failed 
to 
recognize 
her 
because
