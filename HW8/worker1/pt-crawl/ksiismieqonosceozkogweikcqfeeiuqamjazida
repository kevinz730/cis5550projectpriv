following 
sharply 
defined
subdivisions 
of 
tendencies</h1>and 
parties:

The 
first 
party 
consisted 
of 
Pfuel 
and 
his 
adherents-military 
theorists
who 
believed 
in 
a 
science 
of 
war 
with 
immutable 
laws-laws 
of 
oblique
movements, 
outflankings, 
and 
so 
forth. 
Pfuel 
and 
his 
adherents 
demanded
a 
retirement 
into 
the 
depths 
of<p>
the 
country 
in 
accordance 
with 
precise
laws 
defined 
by 
a 
pseudo-theory 
of 
war, 
and 
they 
saw 
only 
barbarism,
ignorance, 
or 
evil 
intention 
in 
every 
deviation 
from 
that 
theory. 
To
this 
party 
belonged 
the 
foreign 
nobles, 
Wolzogen, 
Wintzingerode, 
and
others, 
chiefly 
Germans.

The 
second 
party 
was 
directly 
opposed 
to 
the<p>
first; 
one 
extreme, 
as
always 
happens, 
was 
met 
by 
representatives 
of 
<a href="/aVzUge/ce5sbb6XKBx4bKMVG.html">the</a> 
other. 
The 
members 
of
this 
party 
were 
those 
who 
had 
demanded 
an 
advance 
from 
Vilna 
into 
Poland
and 
freedom 
from 
all 
prearranged 
plans. 
Besides 
being 
advocates 
of 
bold
action, 
this 
section 
also 
represented 
nationalism, 
which 
made 
them 
still
more 
one-sided 
in 
the 
dispute. 
They 
were 
Russians: 
Bagration, 
Ermolov
(who 
was 
beginning 
to 
come 
to 
the 
front), 
and 
others. 
At 
that 
time 
a
famous 
joke 
of 
Ermolov's 
was 
being 
circulated, 
that 
as 
a 
great 
favor 
he
had 
petitioned 
the 
Emperor 
to 
make 
him 
a 
German. 
The 
men 
of 
that 
party,
remembering 
Suvorov, 
said 
that 
what 
one 
had 
to 
do 
was 
not 
to 
reason,
or 
stick 
pins 
into 
maps, 
but 
to 
fight, 
beat 
the 
enemy, 
keep 
him 
out 
of
Russia, 
and 
not 
let 
the 
army 
get 
discouraged.

To 
the 
third 
party-in 
which 
the 
Emperor 
had 
most<p>
confidence-belonged 
the
courtiers 
<a href="/aVzUge/bh1zNkID7Gmw.html">who</a> 
tried 
to 
arrange 
compromises 
between 
the 
other 
two. 
The
members 
of 
this 
party, 
chiefly 
civilians 
and 
to 
whom 
Arakcheev 
belonged,
thought 
and 
said 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/JM10WMYlo2A.html">what</a> 
men 
who 
have 
no 
convictions 
but 
wish 
to 
seem 
to
have 
some 
generally 
say. 
They 
said 
that 
undoubtedly 
war,<p>
particularly
against<p>
such 
a 
genius 
as 
Bonaparte 
(they 
called 
him 
Bonaparte 
now),
needs 
most 
deeply 
devised 
plans 
and 
profound 
scientific 
knowledge 
and
in 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/qK8Gj93kBL.html">that</a> 
respect 
Pfuel 
was 
a 
genius, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
it 
had 
to 
be
acknowledged 
that 
the 
theorists 
are 
often 
one-sided, 
and 
therefore 
one
should 
not 
trust 
them 
absolutely, 
but 
should 
also 
listen 
to 
what 
Pfuel's
opponents 
and 
practical 
men 
of 
experience 
in 
warfare 
had 
to 
say, 
and
then 
choose 
a 
middle 
course. 
They 
insisted 
on 
the 
retention 
of 
the 
camp
at<p>
Drissa, 
according 
to 
Pfuel's 
plan, 
but 
on 
changing 
the 
movements 
of
the 
other 
armies. 
Though, 
by 
this 
course, 
neither 
one 
aim 
nor 
the 
other
could 
be 
attained, 
yet 
it 
seemed 
best 
to 
the 
adherents 
of 
this 
third
party.

Of 
a 
fourth 
opinion 
the 
most 
conspicuous 
representative 
was 
the
Tsarevich, 
who 
could 
not 
forget 
his 
disillusionment 
at 
Austerlitz, 
where
he 
had 
ridden 
out 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the 
Guards, 
in 
his 
casque 
and 
cavalry
uniform 
as 
to 
a 
review, 
expecting 
to 
crush 
the 
French 
gallantly; 
but
unexpectedly 
finding 
himself 
in 
the 
front 
line 
had 
narrowly 
escaped 
amid
the 
general 
confusion. 
The 
men<p>
of 
this 
party 
had 
both 
the 
quality
and 
the 
defect 
of 
frankness 
in 
their 
opinions. 
They 
feared 
Napoleon,
recognized 
his 
strength 
and 
their 
own 
weakness, 
and 
frankly 
said 
so.
They 
said: 
"Nothing 
but 
sorrow, 
shame, 
and 
ruin 
will 
come 
of 
all 
this!
We 
have 
abandoned 
Vilna 
and 
Vitebsk 
and 
shall 
abandon 
Drissa. 
The 
only
reasonable 
thing 
left 
to 
do 
is 
to 
conclude 
peace 
as 
soon 
as 
possible,
before 
we 
are 
turned 
out 
of 
Petersburg."

This 
view 
was 
very 
general 
in 
the 
upper 
army 
circles 
and 
found 
support
also 
in 
Petersburg 
and 
from 
the 
chancellor, 
Rumyantsev, 
who, 
for 
other
reasons 
of 
state, 
was 
in 
favor 
of 
peace.

The 
fifth 
party 
consisted 
of 
those 
who 
were 
adherents 
of 
Barclay 
de
Tolly, 
not 
so 
much 
as 
a 
man 
but 
as 
minister 
of 
war 
and 
commander<p>
in
chief. 
"Be 
he 
what 
he 
may" 
(they 
always 
began 
like 
that), 
"he 
is 
an
honest, 
practical 
man 
and 
we 
have 
nobody<p>
better. 
Give 
him 
real 
power,
for 
war 
cannot 
be 
conducted
