some 
gypsy 
singing 
girl?... 
Well, 
if 
he
had 
carried 
you 
off... 
do 
you 
think 
they 
wouldn't 
have 
found 
him?
Your 
father, 
or 
brother, 
or 
your 
betrothed? 
And 
he's 
a 
scoundrel, 
a
wretch-that's 
a

"He 
is 
better

any 
of 
you!" 
exclaimed 
Natasha 
getting 
up. 
"If 
you
hadn't 
interfered... 
Oh, 
my 
God! 
What 
is 
it 
all? 
What 
is 
it? 
Sonya,
why?... 
Go 
away!"

And 
she

into 
sobs 
with

despairing 
vehemence

hate 
and 
despise 
me!" 
and 
she 
threw 
herself
back 
on 
the 
sofa.

Marya 
Dmitrievna 
went 
on 
admonishing 
her 
for 
some 
time, 
enjoining 
on 
her
that 
it 
<a href="/cZl/jf4H02Npkec.html">must</a> 
all 
be 
kept 
from 
her 
father 
and 
assuring 
her 
that 
nobody
would 
know 
anything 
about 
it 
if 
only 
Natasha 
herself 
would 
undertake
to 
forget 
it 
all 
and 
not 
let 
anyone 
see

something 
had 
happened.
Natasha

nor
