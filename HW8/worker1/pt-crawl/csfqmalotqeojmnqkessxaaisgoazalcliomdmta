CHAPTER 
XVII

Before 
two 
o'clock 
in 
the 
afternoon 
the 
Rostovs' 
four 
carriages, 
packed
full 
and 
with 
the 
horses 
harnessed, 
stood 
at 
the<p>
front 
door. 
One 
by 
one
the 
carts 
with 
the 
wounded 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ew6HAJD7Nqwe1.html">had</a> 
moved 
out 
of 
the 
yard.

The 
caleche 
in 
which 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
being 
taken 
attracted 
Sonya's
attention 
as 
it 
passed 
the 
front 
porch. 
With 
the 
help 
of 
a 
maid 
she 
was
arranging 
a 
seat 
for 
the 
countess 
in 
the 
huge 
high 
coach 
that 
stood 
at
the 
entrance.

"Whose 
caleche 
is 
that?" 
she 
inquired, 
leaning 
out 
of 
the 
carriage
window.

"Why, 
didn't 
you 
know, 
Miss?" 
replied 
the 
maid. 
"The 
wounded 
prince: 
he
spent 
the 
night 
in 
our 
house 
and 
is 
going 
with 
us."

"But 
who 
is 
it? 
What's 
his 
name?"

"It's 
our 
intended 
that 
was-Prince 
Bolkonski 
himself! 
They 
say 
he 
is
dying," 
replied 
the 
maid 
with 
a 
sigh.

Sonya 
jumped 
out 
of 
the 
coach 
and 
ran 
to 
the 
countess. 
The 
countess,
tired 
out 
and 
already 
dressed 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/kg3PUEsy6EAct6tsa.html">in</a> 
shawl 
and 
bonnet 
for 
her 
journey,
was 
pacing 
up 
and 
down 
the 
drawing 
room, 
waiting 
for 
the 
household 
to
assemble 
for 
the 
usual 
silent<p>
prayer 
with 
closed 
doors 
before 
starting.
Natasha 
was 
not 
in 
the 
room.

"Mamma," 
said 
Sonya, 
"Prince 
Andrew 
is 
here, 
mortally 
wounded. 
He 
is
going 
with 
us."

The 
countess 
opened 
her 
eyes 
in 
dismay 
and, 
seizing 
Sonya's 
arm, 
glanced
around.

"Natasha?" 
she 
murmured.

At 
that 
moment 
this 
news 
had 
only 
one 
significance 
for 
both 
of 
them.
They 
knew 
their 
Natasha, 
and 
alarm 
as 
to 
what 
would 
happen 
if 
she 
heard
this 
news 
stifled 
all 
sympathy 
for 
the 
man 
they 
both 
liked.

"Natasha 
does 
not 
know 
yet, 
but 
he 
is 
going<p>
with 
us," 
said 
Sonya.

"You 
say 
he 
is 
dying?"

Sonya 
nodded.

The 
countess 
put 
her 
arms 
around 
Sonya 
and 
began 
to 
cry.

"The 
ways 
of 
God 
are 
past
