CHAPTER 
VI

The 
<a href="/aVzUge/hp7jDLTN5bUI9oRCc.html">old</a> 
count 
went 
home, 
and 
Natasha 
and 
Petya 
promised 
to 
return 
very
soon, 
but 
as 
it 
was 
still 
early 
the 
hunt 
went 
farther. 
At 
midday
they 
put 
the 
hounds 
into 
a 
ravine 
thickly 
overgrown 
with 
young 
trees.
Nicholas 
standing 
in 
a 
fallow 
field 
could 
see 
all 
his 
whips.

Facing 
him 
lay 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/zp4qQqw29HrxvL.html">field</a> 
of 
winter 
rye, 
there 
his 
own 
huntsman 
stood 
alone
in 
a 
hollow 
behind 
a 
hazel 
bush. 
The 
hounds 
had 
<a href="/cZl/ky4tiRgR5PvrsB0.html">scarcely</a> 
been 
loosed
before 
Nicholas<p>
heard 
one 
he 
knew, 
Voltorn, 
giving 
tongue 
at 
intervals;
other 
hounds 
joined 
in, 
now 
pausing 
and 
now 
again 
giving 
tongue. 
A
moment 
later 
he 
heard 
a 
cry 
from 
the 
wooded 
ravine 
that 
a 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Nu5fnBp1NX3.html">fox</a> 
had 
been
found, 
and 
the<p>
whole 
pack, 
joining 
together, 
rushed 
along 
the 
ravine
toward 
the 
ryefield 
and 
away
