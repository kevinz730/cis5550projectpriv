native 
land
was 
too 
far 
off, 
and 
for 
a 
man 
going 
a 
thousand 
miles 
it 
is 
absolutely
necessary 
to 
set 
aside 
his 
final 
goal 
and 
to 
say 
to 
himself: 
"Today 
I
shall 
get 
to 
a 
place 
twenty-five 
miles 
off 
where 
I 
shall 
rest 
and
spend 
the 
night," 
and 
during 
the 
first 
day's 
journey 
that 
resting 
place
eclipses<p>
his 
ultimate 
goal 
and 
attracts 
all 
his 
hopes 
and 
desires. 
And
the 
impulses 
felt 
by 
a 
single 
person 
are 
always 
magnified 
in 
a 
crowd.

For 
the 
French 
retreating 
along 
the 
old 
Smolensk 
road, 
the 
final
goal-their 
native 
land-was 
too 
remote, 
<a href="/cZl/Je29s0aAcKW.html">and</a> 
their 
immediate 
goal
was 
Smolensk, 
toward 
which 
all 
their 
desires 
and 
hopes, 
enormously
intensified 
in 
the 
mass, 
urged 
them 
on. 
It 
was 
not 
that 
they 
knew 
that
much 
food 
and 
fresh 
troops 
awaited 
them 
in 
Smolensk, 
nor 
that 
they 
were
told 
so 
(on 
the 
contrary 
their 
superior 
officers, 
and 
Napoleon 
himself,
knew 
that 
provisions 
were<p>
scarce 
there), 
but 
because 
this 
alone 
could
give 
them<p>
strength 
to 
move 
on 
and 
endure 
their 
present 
privations. 
So
both 
those 
who 
knew 
and 
those 
who 
did 
not 
know 
deceived<p>
themselves, 
and
pushed 
on 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Nc1ikR9pXQvm6bUI.html">to</a> 
Smolensk 
as 
to 
a 
promised 
land.

Coming 
out 
onto 
the 
highroad<p>
the 
French 
fled 
<a href="/aVzUge/SX7b6Cr5a.html">with</a> 
surprising 
energy
and 
unheard-of 
rapidity 
toward 
the 
goal 
they 
had 
fixed 
on. 
Besides 
the
common 
impulse 
which 
bound 
the 
whole 
crowd 
of 
French 
into 
one 
mass 
and
supplied 
them<p>
with 
a 
certain 
energy, 
there 
was 
another 
cause 
binding
them 
together-their 
great 
numbers. 
As 
with 
the 
<a href="/cZl/vf3gJL1H5UTE.html">physical</a> 
law 
of 
gravity,
their 
enormous 
mass 
drew 
the 
individual 
human 
atoms 
to 
itself. 
In 
their
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
they 
moved 
like 
a 
whole 
nation.

Each 
of 
them 
desired 
nothing 
more 
than 
to 
give 
himself 
up 
as<p>
a 
prisoner
to 
escape 
from 
all 
this 
horror 
and 
misery; 
but 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
the 
force
of 
this 
common 
attraction 
to 
Smolensk, 
their 
goal, 
drew<p>
each 
of 
them 
in
the 
same 
direction; 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
an 
army 
corps 
could 
not 
surrender
to 
a 
company, 
and 
though 
the 
French 
availed 
themselves<p>
of 
every
convenient 
opportunity 
to 
detach 
themselves 
and 
to 
surrender 
on 
the
slightest 
decent 
pretext, 
such 
pretexts 
did 
not 
always 
occur. 
Their
very 
numbers 
and 
their 
crowded 
and 
swift<p>
movement 
deprived 
them 
of 
that
possibility 
and 
rendered 
it 
not 
only 
difficult 
but 
impossible 
for 
the
Russians 
to 
stop 
this 
movement, 
to 
which 
the 
French 
were 
directing 
all
their 
energies. 
Beyond 
a 
certain 
limit 
no<p>
mechanical 
disruption 
of 
the
body 
could 
hasten 
the 
process 
of 
decomposition.
