occupied 
by 
the</h1>man
in 
relation 
to 
everything 
coexisting 
with 
him. 
This 
is 
what 
makes 
it
evident 
that 
a 
drowning 
man 
is 
less 
free 
and 
more 
subject 
to 
necessity
than 
one 
standing<p>
on 
dry 
ground, 
and 
that 
makes 
the 
actions 
of 
a 
man
closely 
connected 
with 
others 
in 
a 
thickly 
populated 
district, 
or 
of 
one
bound 
by 
family, 
official, 
or 
business 
duties, 
seem 
certainly 
less 
free
and 
more 
subject 
to 
necessity 
than 
those 
of 
a 
man 
living 
in 
solitude 
and
seclusion.

If 
we 
consider 
a 
man 
alone, 
apart 
from 
his 
relation 
to 
everything 
around
him, 
each 
action 
of 
his 
seems 
to 
us 
free. 
But 
if 
we 
see 
his 
relation
to 
anything 
around 
him, 
if 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/LN8bju0.html">we</a> 
see 
his 
connection 
with 
anything
whatever-with 
a 
man 
who 
speaks 
to 
him, 
a 
book 
he 
reads, 
the 
work 
on
which 
he 
is 
engaged, 
even 
with 
the 
air 
he 
breathes 
or 
the 
light 
that
falls 
on 
the 
things 
about 
him-we 
see 
that 
each 
of 
these 
circumstances
has 
an 
influence 
on 
him 
and 
controls 
at 
least 
some 
side 
of 
his 
activity.
And 
the 
more 
we 
perceive 
of 
these 
influences 
the 
more 
our 
conception 
of
his 
freedom 
diminishes 
and 
the 
more 
our 
conception 
of 
the 
necessity 
that
weighs 
on 
him 
increases.

The 
second 
consideration 
is 
the 
more 
or 
less 
evident 
time 
relation 
of
the 
man 
to 
the 
world 
and 
the 
clearness 
of 
our 
perception 
of 
the 
place
the 
man's 
action 
occupies 
in 
time. 
That 
is 
the 
ground 
which 
makes 
the
fall 
of 
the 
first 
man, 
resulting 
in 
the 
production 
of 
the 
human 
race,
appear 
evidently 
less 
free 
than 
a 
man's 
entry 
into 
marriage 
today. 
It 
is
the 
reason 
why 
the 
life 
and 
activity 
of 
people 
who 
lived 
centuries 
ago
and 
are 
connected 
with 
me 
in 
time 
cannot 
seem 
to 
me 
as 
free 
as 
the 
life
of 
a 
contemporary, 
the 
consequences 
of 
which 
are 
still 
unknown 
to 
me.

The 
degree 
of 
our 
conception 
of 
freedom 
or 
inevitability 
depends 
in 
this
respect 
on 
the 
greater 
or 
lesser 
lapse 
of 
time 
between 
the 
performance
of 
the 
action 
and 
our 
judgment 
of 
it.

If 
I 
examine 
an 
act 
I 
performed 
a 
moment 
ago 
in 
approximately 
the 
same
circumstances 
as 
those 
I 
am 
in 
now, 
my 
action 
appears 
to 
me 
undoubtedly
free. 
But 
if 
I 
examine 
an 
act 
performed 
a 
month 
ago, 
then 
being 
in
different 
circumstances, 
I 
cannot 
help 
recognizing 
that 
if 
that 
act 
had
not 
been 
committed 
much 
that 
resulted 
from 
it-good, 
agreeable, 
and 
even
essential-would 
not 
have 
taken 
place. 
If 
I 
reflect 
on 
an 
action 
still
more 
remote, 
ten 
years 
ago 
or 
more, 
then 
the 
consequences 
of 
my 
action
are 
still 
plainer 
to 
me 
and 
I 
find 
it 
hard 
to 
imagine 
what 
would 
have
happened 
had 
that 
action 
not 
been 
performed. 
The 
farther 
I 
go 
back
in 
memory, 
or 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
the 
farther 
I 
go 
forward 
in 
my
judgment, 
the 
more 
doubtful 
becomes 
my 
belief 
in 
the 
freedom 
of 
my
action.

In 
history 
we 
find 
a 
very 
similar 
progress 
of 
conviction 
concerning
the 
part 
played 
by 
free 
will 
in 
the 
general 
affairs 
of 
humanity. 
A
contemporary 
event 
seems 
to 
us 
to 
be 
indubitably 
the 
doing 
of 
all 
the
known 
participants, 
but 
with 
a 
more 
remote 
event 
we 
already 
see 
its
inevitable 
results 
which 
prevent 
our 
considering 
anything 
else 
possible.
And 
the 
farther 
we 
go 
back 
in 
examining 
events 
the 
less 
arbitrary 
do
they 
appear.

The 
Austro-Prussian 
war 
appears 
to 
us 
undoubtedly 
the 
result 
of 
the
crafty 
conduct 
of 
Bismarck, 
and 
so 
on. 
The 
Napoleonic 
wars 
still 
seem
to 
us, 
though 
already 
questionably, 
to 
be 
the 
outcome 
of 
their 
heroes'
will. 
But 
in 
the 
Crusades 
we 
already 
see 
an 
event 
occupying 
its 
definite
place 
in 
history 
and 
without 
which 
we 
cannot 
imagine 
the 
modern 
history
of 
Europe, 
though 
to 
the 
chroniclers 
of 
the 
Crusades 
that 
event 
appeared
as 
merely 
due 
to 
the 
will 
of 
certain 
people. 
In 
regard 
to 
the 
migration
of 
the 
peoples 
it 
does 
not 
enter 
anyone's 
head 
today 
to 
suppose 
that
the 
renovation 
of 
the<p>
European 
world 
depended 
on 
Attila's 
caprice. 
The
farther 
back 
in 
history 
the 
object 
of 
our 
observation 
lies, 
the 
more
doubtful 
does 
the 
free 
will 
of 
those 
concerned 
in 
the 
event 
become 
and
