his
determination 
he 
had 
<a href="/aVzUge/QI3wNlRn5ahj2jJ.html">to</a> 
give 
in, 
and 
stop 
while 
carriages 
passed 
in,
rumbling 
beneath 
the 
archway. 
Beside 
Petya 
stood 
a 
peasant 
woman, 
a
footman, 
two 
tradesmen, 
and 
a 
discharged 
soldier. 
After 
standing 
some
time 
in 
the 
gateway, 
Petya 
tried 
to 
move 
forward 
in 
front 
of 
the 
others
without 
waiting 
for 
all 
the 
carriages 
to 
pass, 
and 
he 
began 
resolutely
working 
his 
way 
with 
his 
elbows, 
but 
the 
woman 
<a href="/cZl/yY6l5dZEO8hMvng.html">just</a> 
in 
front 
of 
him, 
who
was 
the 
first 
against 
whom 
he 
directed 
his 
efforts, 
angrily 
shouted 
at
him:

"What 
are 
you 
shoving 
for, 
young 
lordling? 
Don't 
you 
see 
we're 
all
standing 
still? 
Then 
why 
push?"

"Anybody 
can 
shove," 
said 
the 
footman, 
and 
also 
began 
working<p>
his 
elbows
to 
such 
effect 
that 
he 
pushed 
Petya 
into 
a 
very 
filthy 
corner 
of 
the
gateway.

Petya 
wiped 
his 
perspiring 
face 
with 
his 
hands 
and 
pulled 
up 
the 
damp
collar 
which 
he 
had 
arranged 
so 
well 
at 
home 
to 
seem 
like 
a 
man's.

He 
felt 
that 
he 
no 
<a href="/cZl/ZCh359hMvng.html">longer</a><p>
looked 
presentable, 
and 
feared 
that 
if 
he 
were
now 
to 
approach 
the 
gentlemen-in-waiting 
in 
that 
plight 
he 
would 
not 
be
admitted 
to 
the 
Emperor. 
But 
<a href="/aVzUge/Nh1wKMFq3Bxt0xLYdP.html">it</a> 
was 
impossible 
to 
smarten 
oneself 
up
or 
move 
to 
another 
place, 
because 
of 
the 
crowd. 
One 
of 
the 
generals 
who
drove 
past 
was 
an 
acquaintance 
of 
the 
Rostovs', 
and 
Petya 
thought 
of
asking 
his 
help, 
but 
came 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
that 
would 
not 
be 
a
manly 
thing 
to 
do. 
When 
the<p>
carriages 
had 
all 
passed 
in, 
the 
crowd,
carrying 
Petya 
with 
it, 
streamed 
forward 
into 
the 
Kremlin 
Square 
which
was 
<a href="/cZl/Ga6ws1ogilO4rhMF.html">already</a> 
full 
of 
people. 
There 
were 
people 
not 
only 
in 
the 
square,
but 
everywhere-on 
the 
slopes 
and 
on 
the 
roofs. 
As 
soon 
as 
Petya 
found
himself 
in 
the 
square 
he 
clearly 
heard 
the 
sound
