and 
his
father, 
sighing 
and 
evidently</h1>disconcerted, 
very 
soon 
became 
silent 
and
went 
in 
to 
the 
countess. 
In 
all 
his 
encounters 
with 
his 
son, 
the 
count
was 
always<p>
conscious 
of 
his 
own 
guilt 
toward 
him 
for 
having 
wasted 
the
family 
fortune, 
and 
so 
he 
could 
not 
be 
angry 
with 
him 
for 
refusing 
to
marry 
an 
heiress 
and 
choosing 
the 
dowerless 
Sonya. 
On 
this<p>
occasion, 
he
was 
only 
more 
vividly 
conscious 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
if 
his 
affairs 
had 
not
been 
in 
disorder, 
no 
better 
wife 
for 
Nicholas 
than 
Sonya 
could 
have
been 
wished 
for, 
and 
that 
no 
one 
but 
himself 
with 
his 
Mitenka 
and
his 
uncomfortable 
habits 
was 
to 
blame 
for 
the 
condition 
of<p>
the 
family
finances.

The 
father 
and 
mother 
did 
not 
speak 
of 
the 
matter 
to 
their 
son 
again,
but 
a 
few 
days 
later 
the 
countess 
sent 
for 
Sonya 
and, 
with 
a 
cruelty
neither 
of 
them 
expected, 
reproached 
her 
niece 
for 
trying 
to 
catch
Nicholas 
and 
for 
ingratitude. 
Sonya 
listened 
silently 
with 
downcast
eyes 
to 
the 
countess' 
cruel 
words, 
<a href="/nocrawl/cZl/CiG4GFXfk5SN4ioN.html">without</a> 
understanding 
what
was<p>
required 
of 
her. 
She 
was 
ready 
to 
sacrifice 
everything 
for 
her
benefactors. 
Self-sacrifice 
was 
her 
most 
cherished 
idea 
but 
in 
this 
case
she 
could 
not 
see 
what 
she 
ought 
to 
sacrifice, 
or 
for 
whom. 
She 
could
not 
help 
loving 
the 
countess 
and 
the 
whole 
Rostov 
family, 
but 
neither
could 
she 
help 
loving 
Nicholas 
and 
knowing 
that 
his 
happiness 
depended
on 
that 
love. 
She 
was 
silent 
and 
sad 
and 
did 
not 
reply. 
Nicholas 
felt
the 
situation 
to 
be 
intolerable 
and 
went 
to 
have 
an 
explanation 
with 
his
mother. 
He 
first 
implored 
her 
to 
forgive 
him 
and 
Sonya 
and 
consent 
to
their 
marriage, 
then 
he 
threatened 
that 
if 
she 
molested 
Sonya 
he 
would
at 
once 
marry 
her 
secretly.

The 
countess, 
with 
a 
coldness 
her 
son 
had 
never 
seen 
in 
her 
before,
replied 
that 
he 
was 
of 
age, 
that 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
marrying 
without 
his
father's 
consent, 
and 
he 
could 
do 
the 
same,<p>
but 
that 
she 
would 
never
receive 
that 
intriguer 
as 
her 
daughter.

Exploding 
at 
the 
word 
intriguer, 
Nicholas, 
raising 
his 
voice, 
told
his 
mother 
he<p>
had 
never 
expected 
her 
to 
try 
to 
force 
him 
to 
sell 
his
feelings, 
but 
if 
that 
were 
so, 
he 
would 
say 
for 
the 
last 
time.... 
But 
he
had 
no 
time 
to 
utter 
the 
decisive 
word 
which 
the 
expression 
of 
his 
face
caused 
his 
mother 
to 
await 
with 
terror, 
and 
which 
would 
perhaps 
have
forever 
remained 
a 
cruel 
memory 
to 
them 
both. 
He 
had 
not 
time 
to 
say 
it,
for 
Natasha, 
with 
a 
pale 
and 
set 
face, 
entered 
the 
room 
from 
the 
door
at 
which 
she 
had 
been 
listening.

"Nicholas, 
you 
are 
talking 
nonsense! 
Be 
quiet, 
be 
quiet, 
be 
quiet, 
I
tell 
you!..." 
she 
almost 
screamed, 
so 
as 
to 
drown 
his 
voice.

"Mamma 
darling, 
it's 
not 
at 
all 
so... 
my 
poor, 
sweet 
darling," 
she
said 
to 
her 
mother, 
who 
conscious 
that 
they 
had 
been 
on 
the 
brink 
of
a 
rupture 
gazed 
at 
her 
son 
with 
terror, 
but 
in<p>
the 
obstinacy 
and
excitement 
of 
the 
conflict 
could 
not 
and 
would<p>
not 
give 
way.

"Nicholas, 
I'll 
explain 
to 
you. 
Go 
away! 
Listen, 
Mamma 
darling,"
said 
Natasha.

Her 
words 
were 
incoherent, 
but 
they 
attained 
the 
purpose 
at 
which 
she
was 
aiming.

The 
countess, 
sobbing 
heavily, 
hid 
her 
face 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/AS9eaK0z3.html">on</a> 
her 
daughter's 
breast,
while 
Nicholas 
rose, 
clutching<p>
his 
head, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xk9CyE4dcFeE.html">and</a> 
left 
the 
room.

Natasha 
set 
to 
work 
to 
effect 
a 
reconciliation, 
and 
so 
far 
succeeded
that 
Nicholas 
received 
a 
promise 
from 
his 
mother 
that 
Sonya 
should 
not
be 
troubled, 
while 
he<p>
on 
his 
side 
promised 
not 
to 
undertake 
anything
without 
his 
parents' 
knowledge.

Firmly<p>
resolved, 
after 
putting 
his 
affairs 
in 
order 
in 
the 
regiment,
to 
retire 
from 
the 
army 
and 
return 
and 
marry 
Sonya, 
Nicholas, 
serious,
sorrowful, 
and 
at 
variance 
with 
his 
parents, 
but, 
as 
it 
seemed 
to 
him,
passionately 
in 
love, 
left 
at 
the 
beginning<p>
of 
January 
to 
rejoin 
his
regiment.

After 
Nicholas 
had 
gone<p>
things 
in 
the 
Rostov 
household 
were 
more
depressing 
than 
ever, 
and 
the 
countess 
fell 
ill 
from
