world
outside-gradually 
began 
to 
disperse 
as 
soon 
as 
Denisov 
began 
reading
his 
answer. 
Rostov 
noticed 
by 
their 
faces 
that 
all 
those 
gentlemen 
had
already 
heard 
that 
story 
more 
than 
once 
and 
were 
tired 
of 
it.<p>
Only 
the
man 
who 
had 
the 
next 
bed, 
a 
stout 
Uhlan, 
continued 
to 
sit 
on 
his 
bed,
gloomily 
frowning 
and 
smoking 
a 
pipe, 
and 
little 
one-armed 
Tushin 
still
listened, 
shaking 
his 
head 
disapprovingly. 
In 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
reading,
the 
Uhlan 
interrupted 
Denisov.

"But 
what 
I 
say 
is," 
he 
said, 
turning 
to 
Rostov, 
"it 
would 
be
best 
simply 
to 
petition 
the 
Emperor 
for 
pardon. 
They 
say 
great 
rewards
will 
now 
be 
distributed, 
and 
surely 
a 
pardon 
would 
be 
granted...."

"Me 
petition 
the 
Empewo'!" 
exclaimed 
Denisov, 
in 
a 
voice 
to 
which
he 
tried 
hard 
to 
give 
the 
old 
energy 
and 
fire, 
but 
which 
sounded 
like
an 
expression 
of 
irritable 
impotence. 
"What 
for? 
If 
I 
were 
a 
wobber 
I
would 
ask 
mercy, 
but 
I'm 
being 
court-martialed 
for 
bwinging 
wobbers
to 
book. 
Let 
them 
twy 
me, 
I'm 
not 
afwaid 
of 
anyone. 
I've 
served
the 
Tsar 
and 
my 
countwy 
honowably 
and 
have 
not 
stolen! 
And 
am 
I 
to 
be
degwaded?... 
Listen, 
I'm 
w'iting 
to 
them 
stwaight. 
This 
is 
what 
I
say: 
'If 
I 
had 
wobbed 
the 
Tweasuwy...'"

"It's 
certainly 
well 
written," 
said 
Tushin, 
"but 
that's 
not
the 
point, 
Vasili 
Dmitrich," 
and 
he 
also 
turned 
to 
Rostov. 
"One
has 
to 
submit, 
and 
Vasili 
Dmitrich 
doesn't 
want 
to. 
You 
know 
the
auditor 
told 
you 
it 
was 
a 
bad 
business."

"Well, 
let 
it 
be 
bad," 
said 
Denisov.

"The 
auditor 
wrote 
out 
a 
petition 
for 
you," 
continued 
Tushin,
"and 
you 
ought 
to 
sign 
it 
and 
ask 
this 
gentleman 
to 
take 
it. 
No 
doubt
he" 
(indicating 
Rostov) 
"has 
connections 
on 
the 
staff. 
You 
won't
find 
a 
better 
opportunity."

"Haven't 
I 
said 
I'm 
not 
going 
to 
gwovel?" 
Denisov 
interrupted
him, 
went 
on 
reading 
his 
paper.

Rostov 
had 
not 
the 
courage 
to 
persuade 
Denisov, 
though 
he
instinctively 
felt 
that 
the 
way 
advised 
by 
Tushin 
and 
the 
other
officers 
was 
the 
safest, 
and 
though 
he<p>
would 
have 
been 
glad 
to 
be 
of
service 
to 
Denisov. 
He 
knew 
his 
stubborn 
will 
and 
straightforward 
hasty
temper.

When 
the 
reading 
of 
Denisov's 
virulent 
reply, 
which 
took 
more 
than<p>
an
hour, 
was 
over, 
Rostov 
said 
nothing, 
and 
he 
spent 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
day
in 
a 
most 
dejected 
state 
of 
mind 
amid 
Denisov's 
hospital 
comrades,
who 
had 
gathered 
round 
him, 
telling 
them 
what 
he 
knew 
and 
listening 
to
their 
stories. 
Denisov 
was 
moodily 
silent 
all 
the 
evening.

Late 
in 
the 
evening, 
when 
Rostov 
was 
about 
to 
leave, 
he 
asked 
Denisov
whether 
he 
had 
no 
commission 
for 
him.

"Yes, 
wait 
a 
bit," 
said 
Denisov, 
glancing 
round 
at 
the 
officers,
and 
taking 
his<p>
papers 
from 
under 
his 
pillow 
he 
went 
to 
the 
window,<p>
where
he 
had 
an 
inkpot, 
and 
sat 
down 
to 
write.

"It 
seems 
it's 
no 
use 
knocking 
one's 
head 
against 
a 
wall!" 
he
said, 
coming 
from 
the 
window 
and 
giving 
Rostov 
a 
large 
<a href="/cZl/fF76zlSDj1rFtA.html">envelope.</a> 
In
it 
was 
the 
petition 
to 
the 
Emperor 
drawn 
up 
by 
the 
auditor, 
in
which 
Denisov, 
without 
alluding 
to 
the 
offenses 
of 
the 
commissariat
officials, 
simply 
asked 
for 
pardon.

"Hand 
it 
in. 
It 
seems..."

He 
did 
not 
finish, 
but 
gave 
a 
painfully 
unnatural 
smile.
