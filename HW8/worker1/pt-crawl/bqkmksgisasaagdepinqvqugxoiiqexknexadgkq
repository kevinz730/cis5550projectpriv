"When 
I</h1>tell 
you 
that 
I 
must 
talk 
to 
you!..." 
repeated 
Pierre.

"Come 
now, 
this 
<a href="/aVzUge/EM7ikR0WVP7Exs.html">is</a> 
stupid. 
What?" 
said 
Anatole, 
fingering 
a 
button 
of
his 
collar 
that 
had 
been 
wrenched 
loose 
with 
a 
bit 
of 
the<p>
cloth.

"You're 
a 
scoundrel 
and 
a 
blackguard, 
and 
I 
<a href="/cZl/Of2bWUL8.html">don't</a> 
know 
what 
deprives
me 
from 
the 
pleasure 
of 
smashing 
your 
head 
with 
this!" 
said 
Pierre,
expressing 
himself 
so 
artificially 
because 
he 
was 
talking 
French.

He 
took 
a 
heavy 
paperweight 
and 
lifted 
it 
threateningly, 
but 
at 
once 
put
it 
back<p>
in 
its 
place.

"Did 
you 
promise 
to 
marry 
her?"

"I... 
I 
didn't 
think 
of 
it. 
I 
never 
promised, 
because..."

Pierre 
interrupted 
him.

"Have 
you 
any 
letters 
of 
hers? 
Any 
letters?" 
he 
said, 
moving 
toward
Anatole.

Anatole 
glanced 
at 
him 
and 
immediately 
thrust 
his 
hand 
into 
his 
pocket
and 
drew 
out 
his 
pocketbook.

Pierre 
took 
the 
letter 
Anatole 
handed 
him 
and, 
pushing 
aside 
a<p>
table
that 
stood 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oG7Xiis3zmeD3.html">in</a> 
his 
way, 
threw 
himself 
on 
the 
sofa.

"I 
shan't 
be 
violent, 
don't 
be 
afraid!" 
said 
Pierre 
in 
answer 
to 
a
frightened 
gesture 
of 
Anatole's. 
"First, 
the 
letters," 
said 
he, 
as 
if
repeating 
a 
lesson 
to 
himself. 
"Secondly," 
he 
continued 
after 
a 
short
pause, 
again 
rising 
and 
again 
pacing 
the 
room, 
"tomorrow 
you 
must 
get
out 
of 
Moscow."

"But 
how 
can 
I?..."

"Thirdly," 
Pierre 
continued 
without 
listening 
to 
him, 
"you 
must 
never
breathe 
a 
word 
of 
what 
has 
passed 
between 
you 
and 
Countess<p>
Rostova.
I 
know<p>
I 
can't 
prevent 
your 
doing 
so, 
but 
if 
you 
have 
a<p>
spark 
of
conscience..." 
Pierre 
paced 
the 
room 
several 
times 
in 
silence.

Anatole 
sat 
at 
a 
table 
frowning 
and 
biting 
his 
lips.

"After 
all, 
you 
must 
understand 
that 
besides 
your 
pleasure 
there 
is 
such
a 
thing 
as 
other 
people's 
happiness 
and 
peace, 
and 
that 
you 
are 
ruining
a 
whole 
life 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
amusing 
yourself! 
Amuse 
yourself 
with 
women
like 
my 
wife-with 
them 
you 
are 
within 
your 
rights, 
for 
they 
know 
what
you 
want 
of 
them.<p>
They 
are 
armed 
against 
you 
by 
the 
same 
experience
of 
debauchery; 
but 
to 
promise 
a 
maid 
to 
marry 
her... 
to 
deceive, 
to
kidnap.... 
Don't 
you 
understand 
that 
it 
is 
<a href="/cZl/gAh6wKMFq6G5NtgpO.html">as</a> 
mean 
as 
beating 
an 
old 
man
or 
a 
child?..."

Pierre 
paused 
and 
looked 
at 
Anatole 
no 
longer 
with 
an 
angry 
but 
with 
a
questioning 
look.

"I 
don't 
know 
about 
that, 
eh?" 
said 
Anatole, 
growing 
more 
confident 
as
Pierre 
mastered 
his 
wrath. 
"I 
don't 
know 
that 
and 
don't 
want 
to," 
he
said, 
not 
looking 
at 
Pierre 
and 
with 
a 
slight 
tremor 
of 
his 
lower 
jaw,
"but 
you 
have 
used 
such 
words 
to 
me-'mean' 
and 
so 
on-which 
as 
a 
man 
of
honor 
I 
can't 
allow 
anyone 
to 
use."

Pierre 
glanced 
at 
him 
with 
amazement, 
unable 
to 
understand 
what 
he
wanted.

"Though 
it 
was 
tete-a-tete," 
Anatole 
continued,
