the 
French.

Przebyszewski 
and 
his 
corps 
had 
laid 
down 
their 
arms. 
Other 
columns
after 
losing 
half 
their 
men 
were 
retreating 
in 
disorderly 
confused
masses.

The 
remains 
of 
Langeron's 
and 
Dokhturov's 
mingled 
forces 
were
crowding 
around 
the 
dams 
and 
banks 
of 
the 
ponds 
near 
the 
village 
of
Augesd.

After 
five 
o'clock 
it 
was 
only 
at 
the 
Augesd 
Dam 
that 
a 
hot 
cannonade
(delivered 
by 
the 
French 
alone) 
was 
still 
to<p>
be 
heard 
from 
numerous
batteries 
ranged 
on 
the 
slopes 
of 
the 
Pratzen 
Heights, 
directed 
at 
our
retreating 
forces.

In 
the 
rearguard, 
Dokhturov 
and 
others 
rallying 
some 
battalions 
kept 
up
a 
musketry 
fire 
at 
the 
French 
cavalry 
that 
was 
pursuing 
our 
troops. 
It
was 
growing 
dusk. 
On 
the 
narrow 
Augesd 
Dam 
where 
for 
so 
many 
years 
the
old 
miller 
had<p>
been 
accustomed 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rz63KSVyY0ws.html">sit</a> 
in 
his 
tasseled 
cap 
peacefully
angling, 
while 
his 
grandson, 
with 
shirt 
sleeves 
rolled 
up, 
handled 
the
floundering 
silvery 
fish 
in 
the 
watering 
can, 
on 
that 
dam 
over 
which 
for
so 
many 
years 
Moravians 
in 
shaggy 
caps 
and 
blue 
jackets 
had 
peacefully
driven 
their 
two-horse 
carts 
loaded 
with 
wheat 
and 
had 
returned<p>
dusty
with 
flour 
whitening 
their 
carts-on 
that 
narrow 
dam 
amid 
the 
wagons
and 
the 
cannon, 
under 
the 
horses' 
hoofs 
and 
between 
the 
wagon 
wheels,
men 
disfigured 
by 
fear 
of 
death 
now 
crowded 
together, 
crushing 
one
another, 
dying, 
stepping 
over 
the 
dying 
and 
killing 
one 
another, 
only 
to
move 
on 
a 
few 
steps 
and<p>
be 
killed 
themselves 
in 
the 
same 
way.

Every 
ten 
seconds 
a 
cannon 
ball 
flew 
compressing 
the 
air 
around, 
or
a 
shell 
burst 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
that 
dense 
throng, 
killing 
some 
and
splashing 
with 
blood 
those 
near 
them.

Dolokhov-now 
an 
officer-wounded 
in 
the 
arm, 
and 
on 
foot, 
with
the 
regimental 
commander 
on 
horseback 
and 
some 
ten 
men 
of 
his 
company,
represented 
all 
that 
was 
left 
of 
that 
whole 
regiment. 
Impelled 
by 
the
crowd, 
they 
had 
got 
wedged 
in 
at 
the 
approach 
to 
the 
dam 
and, 
jammed 
in
on 
all 
sides, 
had 
stopped 
because 
a 
horse 
in 
front 
had 
fallen 
under 
a
cannon<p>
and 
the 
crowd 
were 
dragging 
it 
out. 
A 
cannon 
ball 
killed 
someone
behind 
them, 
another 
fell 
in 
front 
and 
splashed 
Dolokhov 
with 
blood.
The 
crowd, 
pushing 
forward 
desperately, 
squeezed 
together, 
moved 
a 
few
steps, 
and 
again 
stopped.

"Move 
on 
a 
hundred 
yards 
and 
we 
are 
certainly 
saved, 
remain 
here
another 
two 
minutes 
and 
it 
is 
certain 
death," 
thought 
each 
one.

Dolokhov 
who 
was 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
crowd 
forced 
his 
way 
to 
the 
edge
of 
the 
dam, 
throwing 
two 
soldiers 
off 
their 
feet, 
and 
ran 
onto
