There 
were 
about 
thirty 
officers,</h1>with 
Pierre 
among 
them, 
and
about 
three 
hundred 
men.

The 
officers, 
who 
had 
come 
from 
the 
other 
sheds, 
were 
all 
strangers 
to
Pierre 
and 
much 
better 
dressed 
than 
he. 
They 
looked 
at 
him 
and 
at 
his
shoes 
mistrustfully, 
as 
at 
an 
alien. 
Not 
far 
from 
him 
walked 
a 
fat 
major
with 
a 
sallow, 
bloated, 
angry 
face, 
who 
was 
wearing 
a 
Kazan 
dressing
gown 
tied 
round 
with 
a 
towel, 
and 
who 
evidently 
enjoyed 
the 
respect 
of
his 
fellow 
prisoners. 
He 
kept 
one 
hand, 
in 
which 
he 
clasped 
his 
tobacco
pouch, 
inside 
the 
bosom 
of 
his 
dressing 
gown 
and 
held 
the 
stem 
of 
his
pipe 
firmly 
with 
the 
other. 
Panting 
and 
puffing, 
the 
major 
grumbled 
and
growled 
at 
everybody 
because 
he 
thought 
he 
was 
being 
pushed 
and 
that
they 
were 
all 
hurrying 
when 
they 
had 
nowhere 
to 
hurry 
to 
and 
were
all 
surprised 
at 
something 
when 
there 
was 
nothing 
to 
be 
surprised 
at.
Another, 
a 
thin 
little 
officer, 
was 
speaking 
to 
everyone, 
conjecturing
where 
they 
were 
now 
being 
taken 
and 
how 
far 
they 
would 
get 
that 
day. 
An
official 
in 
felt 
boots 
and 
wearing 
a 
commissariat 
uniform 
ran 
round 
from
side 
to 
side 
and 
gazed 
at 
the 
ruins 
of 
Moscow, 
loudly 
announcing 
his
observations 
as 
to 
what 
had 
been 
burned 
down 
and 
what 
this 
or 
that 
part
of 
the 
city 
was 
that 
they 
could 
see. 
A 
third 
officer, 
who 
by 
his 
accent
was 
a 
Pole, 
disputed 
with 
the 
commissariat 
officer, 
arguing 
that 
he 
was
mistaken 
in 
his 
identification 
of 
the 
different 
wards 
of 
Moscow.

"What 
are 
you 
disputing 
about?" 
said 
the 
major 
angrily. 
"What 
does 
it
matter 
whether 
it 
is 
St. 
Nicholas 
or 
St. 
Blasius? 
You 
see 
it's 
burned
down, 
and 
there's 
an 
end 
of 
it.... 
What 
are 
you 
pushing 
for? 
Isn't 
the
road 
wide 
enough?" 
said 
he, 
turning 
to 
a 
man 
behind 
him 
who 
was 
not
pushing 
him 
at 
all.

"Oh, 
oh, 
oh! 
What 
have 
they 
done?" 
the 
prisoners 
on 
one 
side 
and 
another
were 
heard 
saying 
as 
they 
gazed 
on 
the 
charred 
ruins. 
"All 
beyond 
the
river, 
and 
Zubova, 
and 
in 
the 
Kremlin.... 
Just 
look! 
There's 
not 
half 
of
it 
left. 
Yes, 
I 
told 
you-the 
whole 
quarter 
beyond 
the 
river, 
and 
so 
it
is."

"Well, 
you 
know 
it's 
burned, 
so 
what's 
the 
use 
of 
talking?" 
said 
the
major.

As 
they 
passed 
near 
a 
church 
in 
the 
Khamovniki 
(one 
of 
the 
few 
unburned
quarters 
of 
Moscow) 
the 
whole 
mass 
of 
prisoners 
suddenly 
started 
to 
one
side 
and 
exclamations 
of 
horror 
and 
disgust 
were 
heard.

"Ah, 
the 
villains! 
What 
heathens! 
Yes; 
dead, 
dead, 
so 
he 
is... 
And
smeared 
with 
something!"

Pierre 
too 
drew 
near 
the 
church 
where 
the 
thing 
was 
that 
evoked 
these
exclamations, 
and 
dimly 
made 
out 
something 
leaning 
against 
the 
palings
surrounding 
the 
church. 
From 
the 
words<p>
of 
his 
comrades 
who 
saw 
better
than 
he 
did, 
he 
found 
that 
this 
was 
the 
body 
of 
a 
man, 
set 
upright
against 
the 
palings 
with 
its 
face 
smeared 
with 
soot.

"Go 
on! 
What 
the 
devil... 
Go 
on! 
Thirty 
thousand 
devils!..." 
the 
convoy
guards 
began 
cursing 
and 
the 
French 
soldiers, 
with 
fresh 
virulence,
drove 
away 
with 
their 
swords 
the 
crowd 
of 
prisoners 
who 
were 
gazing 
at
the 
dead 
man.





CHAPTER 
XIV

Through 
the 
cross 
streets 
of 
the 
Khamovniki 
quarter 
the 
prisoners
marched, 
followed 
only 
by 
their 
escort 
and 
the 
vehicles 
and 
wagons
belonging 
to 
that 
escort, 
but 
when 
they 
reached 
the 
supply 
stores 
they
came 
among 
a 
huge 
and 
closely 
packed 
train 
of 
artillery 
mingled 
with
private 
vehicles.

At 
the 
bridge 
they 
all 
halted, 
waiting 
for 
those 
in 
front 
to 
get 
across.
From 
the 
bridge<p>
they 
had 
a 
view 
of 
endless 
lines 
of 
moving 
baggage
trains 
before 
and 
behind 
them. 
To 
the 
right, 
where 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
turns
near 
Neskuchny, 
endless 
rows 
of 
troops 
and 
carts 
stretched 
away 
into
the 
distance. 
These 
were 
troops 
of 
Beauharnais' 
corps 
which 
had 
started
before 
any 
of 
the 
others. 
Behind, 
along 
the 
riverside 
and 
across 
the
Stone 
Bridge, 
were 
Ney's 
troops 
and
