of 
finding 
in 
her 
a</h1>rival 
for 
Count 
Bezukhov's 
fortune,
and 
hastened 
to 
reassure 
him.

"If 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/RA1HAJD2FWU8mcR.html">it</a> 
were 
not 
for 
my 
sincere 
affection 
and 
devotion 
to 
Uncle,"
said 
she, 
uttering 
the 
word 
with 
peculiar 
assurance 
and 
unconcern, 
"I
know 
his 
character: 
noble, 
upright 
... 
but 
you 
see 
he 
has 
no 
one 
with
him 
except 
the 
young 
princesses.... 
They 
are 
still 
young...." 
She 
bent
her 
head 
and 
continued 
in 
a 
whisper: 
"Has 
he 
performed 
his 
final 
duty,
Prince? 
How 
priceless 
are 
those<p>
last 
moments! 
It 
can 
make 
things 
no
worse, 
and 
it 
is<p>
absolutely 
necessary 
to 
prepare 
him 
if 
he 
is 
so 
ill.
We 
women, 
Prince," 
and 
she 
smiled 
tenderly, 
"always 
know 
how 
to 
say
these 
things. 
I 
absolutely 
must 
see 
him, 
however 
painful 
it 
may 
be 
for
me. 
I 
am<p>
used 
to 
suffering."

Evidently 
the 
prince 
understood 
her, 
and 
also 
understood, 
as 
he 
had 
done
at 
Anna 
Pavlovna's, 
that 
it 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
Anna
Mikhaylovna.

"Would 
not 
such 
a 
<a href="/cZl/jRO3YXnB5A5mDKi.html">meeting</a> 
be 
too 
trying 
for 
him, 
dear 
Anna
Mikhaylovna?" 
said 
he. 
"Let 
us 
wait 
until 
evening. 
The 
doctors 
are
expecting 
a 
crisis."

"But 
one 
cannot 
delay, 
Prince, 
at 
such 
a 
moment! 
Consider 
that 
the
welfare 
of 
his 
soul 
is<p>
at 
stake. 
Ah, 
it 
is 
awful: 
the 
duties 
of 
a
Christian..."

A 
door 
of 
one 
of 
the 
inner 
rooms 
opened 
and 
one 
of 
the 
princesses, 
the
count's 
niece, 
entered 
with 
a 
cold, 
stern 
face. 
The 
length 
of 
her
body 
was 
strikingly 
out 
of 
proportion 
to 
her 
short 
legs. 
Prince 
Vasili
turned 
to 
her.

"Well, 
how 
is 
he?"

"Still 
the 
same; 
but 
what 
can 
you 
expect, 
this 
noise..." 
said 
the
princess, 
looking 
at 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
as 
at 
a 
stranger.

"Ah, 
my 
dear, 
I 
hardly 
knew 
you," 
said 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
with 
a
happy 
smile, 
ambling 
lightly 
up 
to 
the 
count's 
niece. 
"I 
have 
come,
and 
am 
at 
your 
service 
to 
help 
you 
nurse 
my 
uncle. 
I 
imagine<p>
what 
you
have 
gone 
through," 
and 
she 
sympathetically 
turned 
up 
her 
eyes.

The 
princess 
gave 
no 
reply 
and 
did 
not 
even 
smile, 
but 
left 
the 
room 
as
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
took 
off 
her 
gloves 
and, 
occupying 
the 
position 
she
had 
conquered, 
settled 
down 
in 
an 
armchair, 
inviting 
Prince 
Vasili 
to
take 
a 
seat 
beside 
her.

"Boris," 
she 
said 
to 
her 
son 
with 
a 
smile, 
"I 
shall 
go 
in 
to 
see
the 
count, 
my 
uncle; 
but 
you, 
my 
dear, 
had 
better 
go 
to 
Pierre 
meanwhile
and<p>
don't 
forget 
to 
give 
him 
the 
Rostovs' 
invitation. 
They 
ask 
him
to 
dinner. 
I 
suppose 
he 
won't 
go?" 
she 
continued, 
turning 
to 
the
prince.

"On 
the 
contrary," 
replied 
the 
prince, 
who 
had 
plainly 
become
depressed, 
"I 
shall 
be 
only 
too 
glad 
if 
you 
relieve 
me 
of 
that 
young
man.... 
<a href="/cZl/xh7tHLaX5Z.html">Here</a> 
he 
<a href="/cZl/qZ41SUlC6ZNkA.html">is,</a> 
and 
the 
count 
has 
not 
once 
asked 
for 
him."

He 
shrugged 
his 
shoulders. 
A 
footman 
conducted 
Boris 
down 
one 
flight 
of
stairs 
and 
up 
another, 
to 
Pierre's 
rooms.





CHAPTER 
XVI

Pierre, 
after 
all, 
had 
not 
managed 
to 
choose 
a 
career 
for 
himself 
in
Petersburg, 
and 
had 
been 
expelled 
from 
there 
for 
riotous 
conduct 
and
sent 
to 
Moscow. 
The 
story 
told 
about 
him 
at 
Count 
Rostov's 
was 
true.
Pierre 
had 
taken 
part 
in 
tying 
a 
policeman 
to 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/dN1HV5vWPe9O.html">bear.</a> 
He 
had 
now 
been
for 
some 
days 
in 
Moscow 
and 
was 
staying 
as 
usual 
at 
his 
father's
house. 
Though 
he 
expected 
that 
the 
story 
of 
his 
escapade 
would 
be
already 
known 
in 
Moscow 
and 
that 
the 
ladies 
about 
his 
father-who 
were
never 
favorably 
disposed 
toward 
him-would 
have 
used 
it 
to 
turn 
the
count 
against<p>
him, 
he 
nevertheless 
on 
the 
day 
of 
his 
arrival 
went 
to
his 
father's 
part 
of 
the 
house. 
Entering 
the 
drawing 
room, 
where 
the
princesses 
spent 
most 
of 
their 
time, 
he
