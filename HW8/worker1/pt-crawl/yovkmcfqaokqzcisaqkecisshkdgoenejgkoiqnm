"You 
love 
him?"

"Yes," 
whispered 
Natasha.

"Then 
why 
are 
you 
crying? 
I 
am 
happy 
for 
your 
sake," 
said 
Princess 
Mary,
who 
because 
of 
those 
tears 
quite 
forgave 
Natasha's 
joy.

"It 
won't 
be 
just 
yet-someday. 
Think 
what 
fun 
it 
will 
be 
when 
I 
am 
his
wife

you 
marry 
Nicholas!"

"Natasha, 
I 
have 
asked 
you 
not 
to

Let

hastily 
replied
to 
her 
own 
question. 
"But 
no, 
no,

Yes,

CHAPTER 
I

Seven 
years 
had 
passed. 
The 
storm-tossed 
sea 
of 
European 
history 
had
subsided 
within 
its 
shores 
and 
seemed

(mysterious 
because

movement
of 
humanity 
went 
on 
as 
unceasingly 
as

and
