He 
seized 
his 
son<p>
by 
the 
hand 
with 
small 
bony 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Xs7HAb8Wu7IQlv.html">fingers,</a> 
shook 
it, 
looked
straight 
into 
his 
son's 
face 
with 
keen 
eyes 
which 
seemed 
to 
see
through 
him, 
and 
again 
laughed 
his 
frigid 
laugh.

The 
son 
sighed, 
thus 
admitting 
that 
his 
father 
had 
understood 
him. 
The
old 
man 
continued 
to 
fold 
and 
seal 
his 
letter, 
snatching 
up 
and 
throwing
down 
the 
wax, 
the 
seal, 
and 
the 
paper, 
with 
his 
accustomed 
rapidity.

"What's 
to 
be 
done? 
She's 
pretty! 
I 
will 
do 
everything. 
Make 
your
mind 
easy," 
said 
he 
in 
abrupt 
sentences 
while 
sealing 
his 
letter.
