without
a 
fight 
led 
Murat 
to 
try 
to 
deceive 
Kutuzov 
in 
a 
similar 
way. 
Meeting
Bagration's 
weak 
detachment 
on 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xy5zJMx9GaVr5ddue.html">the</a> 
Znaim 
road 
he 
supposed 
it 
to 
be
Kutuzov's 
whole 
army. 
To 
be 
able 
to 
crush 
it 
absolutely 
he 
awaited
the 
arrival 
of 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
troops 
who 
were 
on 
their 
way 
from 
Vienna,
and 
with 
this 
object 
offered 
a 
three 
days' 
truce 
on 
condition 
that
both 
armies 
should 
remain 
in 
position 
without 
moving. 
Murat 
declared
that 
negotiations<p>
for 
peace 
were 
already 
proceeding, 
and 
that 
he
therefore 
offered 
this 
truce 
to 
avoid 
unnecessary 
bloodshed. 
Count
Nostitz, 
the 
Austrian 
general 
occupying 
the 
advanced 
posts, 
believed
Murat's 
emissary 
and 
retired, 
leaving 
Bagration's 
division
exposed. 
Another 
emissary 
rode 
to 
the 
Russian 
line 
to 
announce 
the 
peace
negotiations 
and 
to 
offer 
the 
Russian 
army 
the 
three 
days' 
truce.
Bagration 
replied 
that 
he 
was 
not 
authorized 
either 
to 
accept 
or 
refuse
a 
truce 
and 
sent 
his 
adjutant 
to 
Kutuzov 
to 
report 
the 
offer 
he 
had
received.

A 
truce 
was 
Kutuzov's 
sole 
chance 
of 
gaining<p>
time,<p>
giving
Bagration's<p>
exhausted 
troops 
some 
rest, 
and 
letting 
the 
transport 
and
heavy 
convoys 
(whose 
movements 
were 
concealed 
<a href="/cZl/dA2tQI5SC4.html">from</a> 
the 
French) 
advance
if 
but 
one 
stage 
nearer 
Znaim. 
The 
offer 
of 
a 
truce 
gave 
the 
only, 
and
a 
quite 
unexpected, 
chance 
of 
saving 
the 
army. 
On 
receiving 
the 
news
he 
immediately 
dispatched 
Adjutant 
General 
Wintzingerode, 
who 
was 
in
attendance 
on 
him, 
to 
the 
enemy 
camp. 
Wintzingerode 
was 
not 
merely
to 
agree 
to 
the 
truce 
but 
also 
to 
offer 
terms 
of 
capitulation, 
and
meanwhile 
Kutuzov 
sent 
his 
adjutants 
back 
to 
hasten 
to 
the 
utmost 
the
movements 
of 
the 
baggage 
trains 
of 
the 
entire 
army 
along 
the 
Krems-Znaim
road. 
Bagration's 
exhausted 
and 
hungry 
detachment, 
which 
alone
covered 
this 
movement 
of 
the 
transport 
and 
of 
the 
whole 
army, 
had 
to
remain
