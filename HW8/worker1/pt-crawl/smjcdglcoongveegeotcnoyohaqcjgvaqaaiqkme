and 
the 
group 
increased, 
dispersed,
re-formed, 
and 
then 
moved 
with 
a 
hum 
of 
talk 
into 
the 
largest 
hall 
and
to 
the 
big 
table. 
Not 
only 
was 
Pierre's 
attempt 
to 
speak 
unsuccessful,
but 
he 
was 
rudely 
interrupted, 
pushed 
aside, 
and 
people 
turned 
away
from 
him 
as 
from 
a 
common 
enemy. 
This 
happened 
not 
because 
they 
were
displeased 
by 
the 
substance 
of 
his 
speech, 
which 
had 
even 
been 
forgotten
after 
the 
many 
subsequent 
speeches, 
but 
to 
animate 
it 
the 
crowd 
needed 
a
tangible 
object 
to 
love 
and 
a 
tangible 
object 
to 
hate. 
Pierre 
became 
the
latter. 
Many 
other 
orators 
spoke 
after 
the 
excited 
nobleman, 
and 
all 
in
the 
same 
tone. 
Many 
spoke 
eloquently 
and 
with 
originality.

Glinka, 
the 
editor 
of 
the 
Russian 
Messenger, 
who 
was 
recognized 
(cries
of 
"author! 
author!" 
were 
heard 
in 
the 
crowd), 
said 
that 
"hell 
must 
be
repulsed 
by 
hell," 
and 
that 
he 
had 
seen 
a 
child 
smiling 
at 
lightning
flashes 
and 
thunderclaps, 
but 
"we 
will 
not 
be 
that 
child."

"Yes, 
yes, 
at 
thunderclaps!" 
was 
repeated 
approvingly 
in 
the 
back 
rows
of 
the 
crowd.

The 
crowd 
drew 
up 
to 
the 
large 
table, 
at 
which 
sat 
gray-haired 
or 
bald
seventy-year-old 
magnates, 
uniformed 
and 
besashed, 
almost 
all 
of 
whom
Pierre 
had 
seen 
in 
their 
own 
homes 
with 
their 
buffoons, 
or 
playing
boston 
at 
the 
clubs. 
With 
an 
incessant 
hum 
of 
voices 
the 
crowd 
advanced
to 
the 
table. 
Pressed 
by 
the 
throng 
against 
the 
high 
backs 
of 
the
chairs, 
the 
orators 
spoke 
one 
after 
another 
and 
sometimes 
two 
together.
Those 
standing 
behind 
noticed 
what 
a 
speaker 
omitted 
to 
say 
and 
hastened
to 
supply 
it. 
Others 
in 
that 
heat 
and 
crush 
racked 
their 
brains 
to 
find
some 
thought 
and 
hastened 
to 
utter 
it. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Dt17xHdu3.html">The</a> 
old 
magnates, 
whom 
Pierre
knew, 
sat 
and 
turned 
to 
look 
first 
at 
one 
and 
then 
at 
another, 
and 
their
faces 
for 
the 
most 
part 
only 
expressed 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
found 
it 
very
hot. 
Pierre, 
however, 
felt 
excited, 
and 
the 
general 
desire 
to 
show 
that
they 
were 
ready 
to 
go 
to 
all 
lengths-which 
found 
expression 
in 
the 
tones
and 
looks 
more 
than 
in 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
speeches-infected 
him 
too.
He 
did 
not 
renounce 
his 
opinions, 
but 
felt 
himself 
in 
some 
way 
to 
blame
and 
wished 
to 
justify 
himself.

"I 
only 
said 
that 
it 
would 
be 
more 
to 
the 
purpose 
to 
make 
sacrifices
when 
we 
know 
what 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Eh7mSaQt9Scb9.html">is</a> 
needed!" 
<a href="/cZl/al5bOIDr0VWVhi1U.html">said</a> 
he, 
trying 
to 
be 
heard 
above 
the
other 
voices.

One 
of 
the 
old 
men 
nearest 
to 
him 
looked 
round, 
but 
his 
attention 
was
immediately 
diverted 
by 
an 
exclamation 
at 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
table.

"Yes, 
Moscow 
will 
be 
surrendered! 
She 
will 
be 
our 
expiation!" 
shouted
one 
man.

"He 
is 
the 
enemy 
<a href="/cZl/YN55W0.html">of</a> 
mankind!" 
cried 
another. 
"Allow 
me 
to 
speak...."
"Gentlemen, 
you 
are 
crushing 
me!..."
