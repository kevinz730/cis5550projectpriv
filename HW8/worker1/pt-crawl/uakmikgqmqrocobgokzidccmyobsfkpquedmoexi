A 
third
section 
scattered 
through 
the 
village 
arranging 
quarters 
for 
the 
staff
officers, 
carrying 
out 
the 
French 
corpses 
that 
were 
in 
the 
huts, 
and
dragging 
away 
boards, 
dry 
wood, 
and 
thatch 
from 
the 
roofs, 
for 
the
campfires, 
or 
wattle 
fences 
to 
serve 
for 
shelter.

Some 
fifteen 
men 
with 
merry 
shouts 
were 
shaking 
down 
the 
high 
wattle
wall 
of<p>
a 
shed, 
the 
roof 
of<p>
which 
had 
already 
been 
removed.

"Now 
then, 
all 
together-shove!" 
cried 
the 
voices, 
and 
the 
huge 
surface
of 
the 
wall, 
sprinkled 
with 
snow 
and 
creaking 
with 
frost, 
was 
seen
swaying 
in 
the 
gloom 
of 
the 
night. 
The 
lower 
stakes 
cracked 
more 
and
more 
and 
at 
last 
the 
wall 
fell, 
and 
with 
it 
the 
men 
who 
had 
been 
pushing
it. 
Loud, 
coarse 
laughter 
and 
joyous 
shouts 
ensued.

"Now 
then, 
catch 
hold 
in 
twos! 
Hand 
up 
the 
lever! 
That's 
it.... 
Where
are 
you 
shoving 
to?"

"Now, 
all 
together! 
<a href="/cZl/PK8tHLaX8sfA3mTUVM.html">But</a> 
wait 
a 
moment, 
boys... 
With 
a 
song!"

All 
stood 
silent, 
and 
a 
soft, 
pleasant 
velvety 
voice 
began 
to 
sing. 
At
the 
end 
of 
the<p>
third 
verse 
as 
the 
last 
note 
died 
away, 
twenty 
voices
roared 
out 
at 
once: 
"Oo-oo-oo-oo! 
That's 
it. 
All 
together! 
Heave 
away,
boys!..." 
but 
despite 
their 
united 
efforts 
the 
wattle 
hardly 
moved, 
and
in 
the 
silence 
that 
followed 
the 
heavy 
breathing 
of 
the 
men 
was 
audible.

"Here, 
you 
of 
the 
Sixth<p>
Company! 
Devils 
that 
you 
are! 
Lend 
a 
hand...
will 
you? 
You 
may 
want 
us 
one 
of 
these 
days."

Some 
twenty 
men 
of 
the 
Sixth 
Company 
who 
were 
on 
their 
way<p>
into 
the
village 
joined 
the 
haulers, 
and 
the 
wattle 
wall, 
which 
was 
about
thirty-five 
feet 
long 
and 
seven 
feet 
high, 
moved 
forward 
along 
the
village 
street, 
swaying, 
pressing 
upon 
and 
cutting 
the 
shoulders 
of 
the
gasping 
men.

"Get 
along... 
Falling? 
What 
are 
you 
stopping 
for? 
There 
now...."

Merry<p>
senseless 
words 
of 
abuse 
flowed 
freely.

"What 
are 
you 
up 
to?" 
suddenly 
came 
the 
authoritative 
voice 
of 
a
sergeant 
major 
who 
came 
upon 
the 
men 
who 
were 
hauling 
their 
burden.
"There 
are 
gentry 
here; 
the 
general 
himself<p>
is 
in 
that 
hut, 
and 
you
foul-mouthed 
devils, 
you 
brutes, 
I'll 
give 
it 
to 
you!" 
shouted 
he,
hitting 
the 
first 
man 
who 
came 
in 
his 
way 
a 
swinging 
blow 
on 
the 
back.
"Can't 
you 
make 
less 
noise?"

The 
men 
became 
silent. 
The 
soldier 
who 
had 
been 
struck 
groaned 
and 
wiped
his 
face, 
which 
had 
been 
scratched 
till 
it 
bled 
by 
his 
falling 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Jm1CX6GCnw3NX.html">against
the</a> 
wattle.

"There, 
how 
that 
devil 
hits 
out! 
He's 
<a href="/cZl/Lg4mbmX92JyP.html">made</a> 
my 
face 
all 
bloody," 
said<p>
he
in 
a 
frightened 
whisper 
when 
the 
sergeant 
major 
had 
passed 
on.

"Don't 
you 
like 
it?" 
said 
a 
laughing 
voice, 
and 
moderating 
their 
tones
the 
men 
moved 
forward.

When 
they 
were 
out 
of 
the 
village 
they 
began 
talking 
again 
as 
loud 
as
before, 
interlarding 
their 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ayy3vZzpo4i7MdWa.html">talk</a> 
with 
the 
same 
aimless 
expletives.

In 
the 
hut 
which 
the 
men 
had 
passed, 
the 
chief 
officers 
had 
gathered 
and
were 
in 
animated 
talk 
over 
their 
tea 
about 
the 
events 
of 
the 
day 
and 
the
maneuvers 
suggested 
for 
tomorrow. 
It 
was 
proposed 
to 
make 
a 
flank 
march
to 
the 
left, 
cut 
off 
the 
Vice-King 
(Murat) 
and 
capture 
him.

By 
the 
time 
the 
soldiers 
had 
dragged 
the 
wattle 
fence 
to 
its 
place
the 
campfires 
were 
blazing 
on 
all 
sides 
ready 
for 
cooking, 
the 
wood
crackled, 
the 
snow 
was 
melting, 
and 
black 
shadows 
of 
soldiers 
flitted
to 
and 
fro 
all 
over 
the 
occupied 
space 
where 
the 
snow 
had 
been 
trodden
down.

Axes 
and 
choppers 
were 
plied 
all 
around. 
Everything 
was 
done 
without 
any
orders 
being 
given. 
Stores 
of 
wood 
were 
brought 
for 
the 
night, 
shelters
were 
rigged 
up 
for 
the 
officers, 
caldrons 
were 
being 
boiled, 
and 
muskets
and 
accouterments 
put 
in 
order.
