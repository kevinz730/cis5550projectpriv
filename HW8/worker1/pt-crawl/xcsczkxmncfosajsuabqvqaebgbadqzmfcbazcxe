jump 
up 
and 
run 
to 
fulfill 
it.

The 
entire 
household 
was 
governed 
according 
to 
Pierre's 
supposed 
orders,
that 
is, 
by 
his 
wishes 
which 
Natasha 
tried 
to 
guess. 
Their<p>
way 
of
life 
and 
place 
of 
residence, 
<a href="/cZl/rJ9U3bXmQ1hQrxS.html">their</a> 
acquaintances 
and 
ties, 
Natasha's
occupations, 
the 
children's 
upbringing, 
were 
all 
selected 
not 
merely
with 
regard<p>
to 
Pierre's 
expressed 
wishes, 
but 
to 
what 
Natasha 
from 
the
thoughts 
he 
expressed 
in 
conversation 
supposed 
his 
wishes 
to 
be. 
And 
she
deduced 
the 
essentials 
of 
his 
wishes 
quite<p>
correctly, 
and 
having 
once
arrived 
at 
them 
clung 
to 
them 
tenaciously. 
When 
Pierre 
himself 
wanted 
to
change 
his 
mind 
she 
would 
fight 
him 
with 
his 
own 
weapons.

Thus 
in 
a 
time 
of 
trouble 
ever 
memorable 
to 
him 
after 
the 
birth 
of 
their
first 
child 
who 
was 
delicate, 
when 
they 
had 
to 
change 
the 
wet 
nurse
three 
times 
and 
Natasha 
fell 
ill 
from 
despair, 
Pierre 
one 
day 
told 
her
of 
Rousseau's 
view, 
with 
which 
he 
quite 
agreed, 
that 
to 
have 
a 
wet
nurse 
is 
unnatural 
and 
harmful. 
When 
her 
next 
baby 
was 
born, 
despite
the 
opposition 
of 
her 
<a href="/cZl/rP5vE4Gj3M.html">mother,</a> 
the 
doctors, 
and 
even 
of 
her 
husband
himself-who 
were 
all 
vigorously 
opposed 
to 
her 
nursing 
her 
baby 
herself,
a 
thing 
then 
unheard 
of 
and 
considered<p>
injurious-she 
insisted 
on 
having
her 
own 
way, 
and 
after 
that 
nursed 
all 
her 
babies 
herself.

It 
very 
often 
happened 
that 
in 
a 
moment 
of 
irritation 
husband 
and 
wife
would 
have 
a 
dispute, 
but 
long 
afterwards 
Pierre 
to 
his 
surprise 
and
delight 
would 
find 
in 
his 
wife's 
ideas 
and 
actions 
the 
very 
thought
against 
which 
she 
had 
argued, 
but 
divested 
of 
everything 
superfluous
that 
in 
the 
excitement 
of 
the 
dispute 
he 
had 
added 
when 
expressing 
his
opinion.

After 
seven 
years 
of 
marriage 
Pierre 
had 
the 
joyous 
and 
firm
consciousness 
that 
he 
was 
not 
a 
bad 
man, 
and 
he 
felt 
this 
because 
he 
saw
himself 
reflected 
in 
his 
wife. 
He 
felt 
the 
good 
and 
bad 
within 
himself
inextricably 
mingled 
and 
overlapping. 
But 
only 
what 
was 
really 
good 
in
him 
was 
reflected 
in 
his 
wife, 
all 
that 
was 
not 
quite 
good 
was 
rejected.
And 
this 
was 
not 
the 
result 
of 
logical 
reasoning 
but 
was 
a 
direct 
and
mysterious 
reflection.





CHAPTER 
XI

Two 
months 
previously 
when 
Pierre 
was 
already 
staying 
with 
the 
Rostovs
he 
had 
received 
a 
letter 
from 
Prince 
Theodore, 
asking 
him 
to 
come
to 
Petersburg 
to 
confer 
<a href="/cZl/tj7oGGl9PsUhP6ohMq.html">on</a> 
some 
important 
questions 
that 
were 
being
discussed 
there 
by 
a 
society 
of 
which 
Pierre 
was 
one<p>
of 
the 
principal
founders.

On 
reading 
that 
letter 
(she 
always 
read 
her 
husband's 
letters) 
Natasha
herself 
suggested 
that 
<a href="/aVzUge/zl36Jk9rP.html">he</a> 
should 
go 
to 
Petersburg, 
though 
she 
would 
feel
his 
absence 
very 
acutely. 
She 
attributed 
immense 
importance 
to 
all
her 
husband's 
intellectual 
and 
abstract 
interests 
though 
she 
did 
not
understand 
them, 
and 
she 
always 
dreaded 
being 
a 
hindrance 
to 
him 
in 
such
matters. 
To 
Pierre's 
timid 
look 
of<p>
inquiry 
after 
reading 
the 
letter 
she
replied 
by 
asking 
him 
to 
go, 
but 
to 
fix 
a 
definite 
date 
for 
his 
return.
He 
was 
given 
four 
weeks' 
leave 
of 
absence.

Ever 
since 
that 
leave 
of 
absence 
had 
expired, 
more 
than 
a 
fortnight
before, 
Natasha 
had 
been
