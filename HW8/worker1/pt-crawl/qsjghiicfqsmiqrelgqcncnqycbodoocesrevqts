say 
that 
to</h1>me? 
You
know 
nothing 
about 
it. 
Tell 
General 
Barclay 
from 
me 
that 
his 
information
is 
incorrect 
and 
that 
the 
real 
course 
of 
the 
battle 
is 
better 
known 
to
me, 
the 
commander 
in 
chief, 
than 
to 
him."

Wolzogen 
was 
about 
to 
make 
a 
rejoinder, 
but 
Kutuzov 
interrupted 
him.

"The 
enemy 
has 
been 
repulsed 
on 
the 
left 
and 
defeated 
on 
the 
right
flank. 
If 
you 
have 
seen 
amiss, 
sir, 
do 
not 
allow 
yourself 
to 
say 
what
you 
don't 
know! 
Be 
so 
good 
as 
to 
ride 
to 
General 
Barclay 
and 
inform
him 
of 
my 
firm 
intention 
to 
attack 
the 
enemy 
tomorrow," 
said 
Kutuzov
sternly.

All 
were 
silent, 
<a href="/cZl/Ga6ws1ogilO4rhMF.html">and</a> 
the 
only 
sound 
audible 
was 
the 
heavy 
breathing 
of
the 
panting 
old 
general.

"They 
are 
repulsed 
everywhere, 
for 
which 
I 
thank 
God 
and 
our 
brave 
army!
The 
enemy 
is 
beaten, 
and 
tomorrow 
we 
shall 
drive 
him 
from 
the 
sacred
soil 
of 
Russia," 
said 
Kutuzov 
crossing 
himself, 
and 
he 
suddenly 
sobbed
as 
his 
eyes 
filled 
with 
tears.

Wolzogen, 
shrugging 
his 
shoulders 
and 
curling 
his 
lips, 
stepped 
silently
aside, 
marveling 
at 
"the 
old 
gentleman's" 
conceited 
stupidity.

"Ah,<p>
here 
he 
is, 
my 
hero!" 
said 
Kutuzov 
to 
a 
portly, 
handsome,
dark-haired 
general 
who 
was 
just 
ascending 
the 
knoll.

This 
was 
Raevski, 
who<p>
had 
spent 
the 
whole 
day 
at 
the 
most 
important 
part
of 
the 
field 
of 
Borodino.

Raevski 
reported 
that 
the 
troops 
were 
firmly 
holding 
their 
ground 
and
that 
the 
French 
no 
longer 
ventured 
to 
attack.

After 
hearing 
him, 
Kutuzov 
said 
in 
French:

"Then 
you 
do 
not 
think, 
like 
some 
others, 
that 
we 
must 
retreat?"

"On 
the 
contrary, 
your<p>
Highness, 
in 
indecisive 
actions 
it 
is 
always
the 
most 
stubborn 
who 
remain 
victors," 
replied 
Raevski, 
"and 
in 
my
opinion..."

"Kaysarov!" 
Kutuzov 
called 
to 
his 
adjutant. 
"Sit 
down 
and 
write 
out
the 
order 
of 
the 
day 
for 
tomorrow. 
And 
you," 
he 
continued, 
addressing
another, 
"ride 
along 
the 
line 
and 
announce 
that 
tomorrow 
we 
attack."

While 
Kutuzov 
was 
talking 
to 
Raevski 
and 
dictating 
the 
order 
of 
the 
day,
Wolzogen 
returned 
from 
Barclay 
and 
said 
that 
General 
Barclay 
wished 
to
have 
written 
confirmation 
of 
the 
order 
the 
field 
marshal 
had 
given.

Kutuzov, 
without 
looking 
at<p>
Wolzogen, 
gave 
directions 
for 
the 
order 
to
be<p>
written 
out 
which 
the 
former 
commander 
in 
chief, 
to 
avoid 
personal
responsibility, 
very 
judiciously 
wished 
to 
receive.

And 
by 
means 
of 
that 
mysterious 
indefinable 
bond 
which 
maintains
throughout 
an 
army 
one 
and 
the 
same 
temper, 
known 
as 
"the 
spirit 
of
the 
army," 
and 
which 
constitutes 
the 
sinew 
of 
war, 
Kutuzov's 
words, 
his
order 
for 
a 
battle 
next 
day, 
immediately 
became 
known 
from 
one 
end 
of
the 
army 
to 
the 
other.

It 
was 
far 
from 
being 
the 
same 
words 
or 
the 
same 
order 
that 
reached 
the
farthest 
links 
of 
that 
chain. 
The 
tales 
passing 
from 
mouth 
to 
mouth 
at
different 
ends 
of 
the 
army 
did 
not 
even 
resemble 
what 
Kutuzov 
had 
said,
but 
the 
sense 
of 
his 
words 
spread 
everywhere 
because 
what 
he 
said 
was
not 
the 
outcome 
of 
cunning 
calculations, 
but 
of 
a 
feeling 
that 
lay
