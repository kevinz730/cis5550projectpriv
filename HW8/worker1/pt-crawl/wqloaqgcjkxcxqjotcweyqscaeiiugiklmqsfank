CHAPTER 
X

On 
the 
thirtieth 
of 
August 
Pierre 
reached 
Moscow. 
Close 
to 
the 
gates 
of
the 
city 
he 
was 
met 
by 
Count 
Rostopchin's 
adjutant.

"We 
have 
been 
looking 
for 
you 
everywhere," 
said 
the 
adjutant. 
"The 
count
wants 
to 
see 
you 
particularly. 
He 
asks 
you 
to 
come 
to 
him 
at 
once 
on 
a
very 
important 
matter."

Without 
going 
home, 
Pierre 
took 
a 
cab 
and 
drove 
<a href="/aVzUge/cF9JCLL4k6.html">to</a> 
see 
the 
Moscow
commander 
in

Count 
Rostopchin 
had 
only 
that 
morning 
returned 
to 
town 
from 
his 
summer
villa 
at 
Sokolniki. 
The 
anteroom 
and 
reception 
room 
of 
his 
house
were 
full 
of 
officials 
who 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vh5UTE21.html">had</a> 
been 
summoned 
or 
had 
come 
for 
orders.
Vasilchikov 
and 
Platov 
had 
already 
seen 
the 
count 
and 
explained 
to 
him
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
defend<p>
Moscow 
and 
that 
it 
would 
have 
to 
be
surrendered.
