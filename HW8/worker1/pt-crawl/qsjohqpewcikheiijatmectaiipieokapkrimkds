said 
he.

The 
Cossack</h1>raised 
his 
arm 
and 
a 
shot 
rang 
out. 
In 
an 
instant 
the 
tramp
of 
horses 
galloping 
forward 
was 
heard, 
shouts 
<a href="/aVzUge/vP8AF3pDix7CBzhL.html">came</a> 
from 
various 
sides,
and 
then 
more 
shots.

At 
the 
first 
sound 
of 
trampling 
hoofs 
and 
shouting, 
Petya 
lashed 
his
horse 
and 
loosening<p>
his 
rein 
galloped 
forward, 
not 
heeding 
Denisov 
who
shouted 
at 
him. 
It 
seemed 
to 
Petya 
that 
at 
the 
moment 
the 
shot 
was
fired 
it 
suddenly 
became 
as 
bright 
as 
noon. 
He 
galloped 
to 
the 
bridge.
Cossacks 
were 
galloping 
along 
the 
road 
in 
front 
of 
him. 
On 
<a href="/aVzUge/hfW4o2vtfU0.html">the</a> 
bridge
he 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ro24om6yYzh.html">collided</a> 
with 
a 
Cossack 
who 
had 
fallen 
behind, 
but 
he 
galloped 
on.
In 
front 
of 
him 
soldiers, 
probably 
Frenchmen, 
were 
running 
from 
right
to 
left 
across 
the 
road. 
One 
of 
them 
fell 
in 
the 
mud 
under 
his 
horse's
feet.

Cossacks 
were 
crowding 
about 
a 
hut, 
busy 
with 
something. 
From 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Hi3AF3G4KqZP.html">the</a> 
midst
of 
that 
crowd 
terrible 
screams 
arose. 
Petya 
galloped 
up, 
and 
the
first 
thing 
he 
saw 
was 
the 
pale 
face 
and 
trembling 
jaw 
of 
a 
Frenchman,
clutching<p>
the 
handle 
of 
a 
lance 
that 
had 
been 
aimed 
at 
him.

"Hurrah!... 
Lads!... 
ours!" 
shouted 
Petya, 
and 
giving 
rein 
to 
his
excited 
horse 
<a href="/aVzUge/HK3WVP4FWU2At.html">he</a> 
galloped 
forward 
along 
the 
village
