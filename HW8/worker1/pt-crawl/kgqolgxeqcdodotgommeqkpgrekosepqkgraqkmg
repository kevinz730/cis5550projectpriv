white 
cotton 
cap, 
knelt 
sighing 
and 
groaning 
on 
a 
rug 
and
bowing 
to 
the 
ground 
in<p>
prayer, 
her 
door 
creaked 
and 
Natasha, 
also 
in
a 
dressing 
jacket 
with 
slippers 
on 
her 
bare 
feet 
and 
her 
hair 
in
curlpapers, 
ran 
in. 
The 
countess-her 
prayerful 
mood 
dispelled-looked
round 
and 
frowned. 
She 
was 
finishing 
her 
last 
prayer: 
"Can 
it 
be 
that
this 
couch 
will 
be 
my 
grave?" 
Natasha, 
flushed 
and 
eager, 
seeing
her 
mother 
in 
prayer, 
suddenly 
checked 
her 
rush, 
half 
sat 
down, 
and
unconsciously 
put 
out 
her 
tongue 
as 
if 
chiding 
herself. 
Seeing 
that
her 
mother 
was 
still 
praying 
she 
ran 
on 
tiptoe 
to 
the 
bed 
and, 
rapidly
slipping 
one 
little 
foot 
against 
the 
other, 
pushed 
off 
her 
slippers 
and
jumped 
onto 
the 
bed 
the 
countess 
had 
feared 
might 
become 
her 
grave. 
This
couch 
was 
high, 
with 
a 
feather 
bed 
and 
five 
pillows 
each 
smaller 
than
the 
one 
below. 
Natasha 
jumped 
on 
it, 
sank 
into 
the 
feather 
bed,<p>
rolled
over<p>
to 
the 
wall, 
and 
began 
snuggling 
up 
the 
bedclothes 
as 
she 
settled
down, 
raising 
her 
knees<p>
to 
her 
chin, 
kicking 
out 
and 
laughing 
almost
inaudibly, 
now 
covering 
herself 
up 
head 
and 
all, 
and 
now 
peeping 
at 
her
mother. 
The 
countess 
finished 
her 
prayers 
and 
came 
to 
the 
bed 
with 
a
stern 
face, 
but 
seeing 
that 
Natasha's 
head 
was 
covered, 
she 
smiled
in 
her 
kind, 
weak 
way.

"Now 
then, 
now 
then!" 
said 
she.

"Mamma, 
can 
we 
have 
a 
talk? 
Yes?" 
said 
Natasha. 
"Now, 
just 
one 
on
your 
throat 
and 
another... 
that'll 
do!" 
And 
seizing 
her 
mother 
round
the 
neck, 
she 
kissed 
her 
on 
the 
throat. 
In 
her 
behavior 
to 
her 
mother
Natasha 
seemed 
rough, 
but 
she 
was 
so 
sensitive 
and 
tactful 
that 
however
she 
clasped 
her 
mother<p>
she 
<a href="/cZl/gs6EnBVm3UQ1U.html">always</a> 
managed 
to 
do 
it 
without 
hurting 
her
or 
making 
her 
feel 
uncomfortable 
or 
displeased.

"Well, 
what 
is 
it 
tonight?" 
said 
the 
mother, 
having 
arranged 
her
pillows 
and 
waited 
until 
Natasha, 
after 
turning 
over 
a 
couple 
of 
times,
had 
settled 
down 
beside 
her 
under 
the 
quilt, 
spread 
out 
her 
arms, 
and
assumed 
a 
serious 
expression.

These 
visits 
of 
Natasha's 
at 
night 
before 
the 
count 
returned 
from 
his
club 
were 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
pleasures 
of 
both 
mother, 
and 
daughter.

"What 
is<p>
it 
tonight?-But 
I 
have 
to 
tell 
you..."

Natasha 
put 
her 
hand 
on 
her 
mother's 
mouth.

"About 
Boris... 
I 
know," 
she 
said 
seriously; 
"that's 
what 
I
have 
come 
about. 
Don't 
say 
it-I 
know. 
No, 
do 
tell 
me!" 
and 
she
removed 
her 
hand. 
"Tell 
me, 
Mamma! 
He's 
nice?"

"Natasha, 
you 
are 
sixteen. 
At 
your 
age 
I 
was 
married. 
You 
say 
Boris
is 
nice. 
He 
is 
very 
nice, 
and 
I 
love 
him 
like 
a 
son. 
But 
what 
then?...
What 
are 
you 
thinking 
about? 
You 
have 
quite 
turned 
his 
head, 
I 
can 
see
that...."

As 
she 
said 
this 
the 
countess 
looked 
round 
at 
her 
daughter. 
Natasha
was 
lying 
looking 
steadily 
straight 
before 
her 
at 
one 
of 
the 
mahogany
sphinxes 
carved 
on 
the 
corners 
of 
the 
bedstead, 
so 
that 
the 
countess
only 
saw 
her 
daughter's 
face 
in 
profile. 
That 
face 
struck 
her 
by 
its
peculiarly 
serious 
and 
concentrated 
expression.

Natasha 
was 
listening 
and 
considering.

"Well, 
what 
then?" 
said 
she.

"You 
have 
quite 
turned 
his 
head, 
and 
why? 
What 
do 
you 
want 
of 
him? 
You
know 
you 
can't 
marry 
him."

"Why 
not?" 
said<p>
Natasha, 
without 
changing 
her 
position.

"Because 
he 
is 
young, 
because 
he 
is 
poor, 
because 
he 
is 
a 
relation...
and 
because 
you 
yourself 
don't 
love 
him."

"How 
do 
you 
know?"

"I 
know. 
It 
is 
not 
right, 
darling!"

"But 
if 
I 
want 
to..." 
said 
Natasha.

"Leave 
off 
talking 
nonsense," 
said 
the 
countess.

"But 
if 
I 
want 
to..."

"Natasha, 
I 
am 
in 
earnest..."

Natasha 
did 
not 
let 
her 
finish. 
She<p>
drew 
the 
countess' 
large 
hand 
to
her, 
kissed 
it 
on 
the 
back 
and 
then 
on 
the 
palm, 
then 
again 
turned 
it
over 
and 
began 
kissing 
first 
one 
knuckle, 
then 
the 
space
