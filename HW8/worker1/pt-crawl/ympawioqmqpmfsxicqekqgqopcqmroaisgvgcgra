Rostopchin 
was 
mentally</h1>preparing 
the 
angry 
and
stinging 
reproaches 
he 
meant 
to 
address 
to 
Kutuzov 
for 
his 
deception. 
He
would 
make 
that 
foxy 
old 
courtier 
feel 
that 
the 
responsibility 
for 
all
the 
calamities 
that 
would 
follow 
the 
abandonment 
of 
the 
city 
and 
the
ruin 
of 
Russia 
(as 
Rostopchin 
regarded 
it) 
would 
fall 
upon 
his 
doting
old 
head. 
Planning 
beforehand 
what 
he 
would 
say 
to 
Kutuzov, 
Rostopchin
turned 
angrily 
in 
his 
caleche 
and 
gazed

from 
side 
to 
side.

The 
Sokolniki 
field 
was 
deserted. 
Only 
at 
the 
end 
of 
it, 
in 
front 
of 
the
almshouse 
and 
the 
lunatic 
asylum, 
could 
be 
seen 
some 
people 
in 
white
and 
others 
like 
them 
walking 
singly 
across 
the 
field 
shouting 
and
gesticulating.

One 
of 
these 
was 
running 
to 
cross 
the 
path 
of 
Count 
Rostopchin's
carriage, 
and 
the 
count 
himself, 
his 
coachman, 
and 
his 
dragoons
looked 
with 
vague 
horror 
and 
curiosity
