in 
chief 
as 
a 
reward 
for 
his 
victory, 
does 
not 
give 
up
the 
command 
of 
the 
army 
to 
General 
Buxhoewden. 
During 
this 
interregnum
we 
begin 
a 
very 
original 
and 
interesting 
series 
of 
maneuvers. 
Our 
aim 
is
no 
longer, 
as 
it 
should 
be, 
to 
avoid 
or 
attack 
the 
enemy, 
but 
solely 
to
avoid 
General 
Buxhoewden 
who 
by 
right 
of 
seniority 
should 
be 
our 
chief.
So<p>
energetically 
do 
we 
pursue 
this 
aim 
that 
after 
crossing 
an 
unfordable
river 
we 
burn 
the 
bridges 
to 
separate 
ourselves 
from 
our 
enemy, 
who 
at
the 
moment 
is 
not 
Bonaparte 
but 
Buxhoewden. 
General 
Buxhoewden 
was 
all
but 
attacked 
and 
captured<p>
by 
a 
superior 
enemy 
force 
as 
a 
result 
of 
one
of 
these 
maneuvers 
that 
enabled 
us 
to 
escape 
him. 
Buxhoewden 
pursues
us-we 
scuttle. 
He 
hardly 
crosses 
the 
river 
to 
our 
side 
before<p>
we
recross 
to 
the 
other. 
At 
last 
our 
enemy, 
Buxhoewden, 
catches 
us 
and
attacks. 
Both 
generals 
are 
angry, 
and 
the 
result 
is 
a 
challenge 
on
Buxhoewden's 
part 
and 
an 
epileptic 
fit 
on 
Bennigsen's. 
But 
at 
the
critical 
moment 
the 
courier 
who 
carried 
the 
news 
of 
our 
victory 
at
Pultusk 
to 
Petersburg 
returns 
bringing 
our 
appointment 
as 
commander 
in
chief, 
and 
our 
first 
foe, 
Buxhoewden, 
is 
vanquished; 
we 
can 
now 
turn
our 
thoughts 
<a href="/cZl/YR7wjGAw7v9yeL.html">to</a> 
the 
second, 
Bonaparte.
