while</h1>others 
on 
the 
contrary 
reported 
that 
the
Russian 
army 
had 
been 
destroyed. 
Some 
talked 
about 
the 
Moscow 
militia
which, 
preceded 
by 
the 
clergy, 
would 
go 
to 
the 
Three 
Hills; 
others
whispered 
that 
Augustin 
had 
been 
forbidden 
to 
leave, 
that 
traitors 
had
been 
seized, 
that 
the 
peasants 
were 
rioting 
and 
robbing 
people 
on 
their
way 
from 
Moscow, 
and 
so 
on. 
But 
all 
this 
was 
only 
talk; 
in 
reality
(though 
the 
Council 
of 
Fili, 
at 
which 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
abandon 
Moscow,
had 
not 
yet 
been 
held) 
both 
those 
who 
went 
away 
and 
those 
who 
remained
behind 
felt, 
though 
they 
did 
not<p>
show 
it, 
that 
Moscow 
would 
certainly
be 
abandoned, 
and 
that 
they 
ought 
to 
get 
away 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible 
and
save 
their 
belongings. 
It 
was 
felt 
that 
everything 
would 
suddenly 
break
up 
and 
change, 
but 
up 
to 
the 
first 
of 
September 
nothing 
had 
done 
so.
As 
a 
criminal 
who 
is 
being 
led 
to 
execution 
knows 
that 
he 
must 
die
immediately, 
but 
yet 
looks 
about 
him 
and<p>
straightens 
the<p>
cap 
that 
is
awry 
on 
his 
head,<p>
so 
Moscow 
involuntarily 
continued 
its 
wonted 
life,
though 
it 
knew 
that 
the 
time 
of 
its 
destruction 
was 
near 
when 
the
conditions 
of 
life 
to 
which<p>
its 
people 
were 
accustomed 
to 
submit 
would
be 
completely 
upset.

During 
the 
three 
days 
preceding 
the 
occupation 
of 
Moscow 
the 
whole
Rostov 
family 
was 
absorbed 
in 
various 
activities. 
The 
head 
of 
the
family, 
Count 
Ilya 
Rostov, 
continually 
drove 
about 
the 
city 
collecting
the 
current 
rumors 
from 
all 
sides 
and<p>
gave 
superficial 
and 
hasty 
orders
at 
home<p>
about 
the 
preparations 
for 
their 
departure.

The 
countess 
watched 
the 
things 
being 
packed, 
was 
dissatisfied 
with
everything, 
was 
constantly 
in 
pursuit 
of 
Petya 
who 
was 
always 
running
away 
from 
her, 
and 
was 
jealous 
of 
Natasha 
with 
whom 
he 
spent 
all 
his
time. 
Sonya 
alone 
directed 
the 
practical 
side 
of 
matters 
by 
getting
things 
packed. 
But 
of 
late 
Sonya 
had 
been 
particularly 
sad 
and 
silent.
Nicholas' 
letter 
in 
which 
he 
mentioned 
Princess 
Mary 
had<p>
elicited, 
in
her 
presence, 
joyous 
comments 
from 
the 
countess, 
who 
saw 
an 
intervention
of 
Providence 
in 
this 
meeting 
of 
the 
princess 
and 
Nicholas.

"I 
was 
never 
pleased 
at 
Bolkonski's 
engagement 
to 
Natasha," 
said 
the
countess,<p>
"but 
I 
always 
wanted 
Nicholas 
to 
marry 
the 
princess, 
and 
had 
a
presentiment 
that 
it 
would 
happen. 
What 
a 
good 
thing 
it 
would 
be!"

Sonya 
felt 
that 
this 
was 
true: 
that 
the 
only 
possibility 
of 
retrieving
the 
Rostovs' 
affairs 
was 
by 
Nicholas 
marrying 
a 
rich 
woman, 
and 
that 
the
princess 
was 
a 
good 
match. 
It 
was 
very 
bitter 
for 
her. 
But 
despite
her 
grief,<p>
or 
perhaps 
just 
because 
of 
it, 
she 
took 
on 
herself 
all 
the
difficult 
work 
of 
directing<p>
the 
storing 
and 
packing 
of 
their 
things 
and
was 
busy 
for 
whole 
days. 
The 
count 
and 
countess 
turned 
to 
her 
when 
they
had 
any 
orders 
to 
give. 
Petya 
and 
Natasha 
on 
the 
contrary, 
far 
from
helping 
their 
parents, 
were 
generally 
a 
nuisance 
and 
a 
hindrance 
to
everyone. 
Almost 
all 
day 
long 
the 
house 
resounded 
with 
their 
running
feet, 
their 
cries, 
and 
their 
spontaneous 
laughter. 
They 
laughed 
and 
were
gay 
not 
because 
there 
was 
any 
reason 
to 
laugh, 
but 
because 
gaiety 
and
mirth 
were 
in 
their 
hearts 
and 
so 
everything 
that 
happened 
was 
a 
cause
for 
gaiety<p>
and 
laughter 
to 
them. 
Petya 
was 
in 
high 
spirits 
because
having 
left 
home 
a 
boy 
he 
had 
returned 
(as 
everybody 
told 
him) 
a 
fine
young 
man, 
because 
he 
was 
at 
home, 
because 
he 
had 
left 
Belaya 
Tserkov
where 
there 
was 
no 
hope 
of 
soon 
taking 
part 
in 
a 
battle 
and 
had 
come 
to
Moscow 
where 
there 
was 
to 
be 
fighting 
in 
a 
few 
days, 
and 
chiefly 
because
Natasha, 
whose 
lead 
he 
always 
followed, 
was 
in 
high 
spirits. 
Natasha 
was
gay 
because 
she 
had 
been 
sad 
too 
long 
and 
now 
nothing 
reminded 
her 
of
the 
cause 
of 
her 
sadness, 
and 
because 
she 
was 
feeling 
well. 
She 
was 
also
happy 
because 
she 
had 
someone<p>
to 
adore 
her: 
the 
adoration 
of 
others 
was
a 
lubricant 
the 
wheels 
of 
her 
machine 
needed 
to 
make 
them 
run 
freely-and
Petya 
adored 
her. 
Above 
all, 
they 
were 
gay 
because 
there 
was 
a 
war
