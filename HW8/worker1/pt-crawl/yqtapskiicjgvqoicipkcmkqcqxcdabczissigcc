CHAPTER 
XX

Pierre 
did 
not 
stay 
for 
dinner, 
but 
left<p>
the 
room 
and 
went 
away 
at 
once.
He 
drove 
through 
the 
town 
seeking 
Anatole 
Kuragin, 
at 
the 
thought 
of
whom 
now 
the 
blood 
rushed 
to 
his 
heart 
and 
he 
felt 
a 
difficulty 
in
breathing. 
He 
was 
not 
at 
the 
ice 
hills, 
nor 
at 
the 
gypsies', 
nor 
at
Komoneno's. 
Pierre 
drove 
to 
the 
Club. 
In 
the 
Club 
all 
was 
going 
on 
as
usual. 
The 
members 
who 
were 
assembling 
for 
dinner 
were 
sitting 
about
in 
groups; 
they 
greeted 
Pierre 
and 
spoke 
of 
the 
town 
news. 
The 
footman
having 
greeted 
him, 
knowing 
his 
habits 
and 
his 
acquaintances, 
told 
him
there 
was 
a 
place 
left 
for 
him 
in 
the 
small 
dining 
room 
and 
that 
Prince
Michael 
Zakharych 
was 
in 
the 
library, 
but 
Paul 
Timofeevich 
had 
not 
yet
arrived. 
One 
of 
Pierre's 
acquaintances, 
while 
they 
were 
talking 
about
the 
weather, 
asked 
if 
he 
had<p>
heard 
of 
Kuragin's 
abduction 
of 
Rostova
which 
was 
talked 
of 
in 
the 
town, 
and 
was 
it 
true? 
Pierre 
laughed 
and
said 
it 
was 
nonsense 
for 
he 
had 
just 
come 
from 
the 
Rostovs'. 
He 
asked
everyone 
about 
Anatole. 
One 
man 
told 
him 
he 
had 
not 
come 
yet, 
and
another 
that 
he 
was 
coming 
to 
dinner.<p>
Pierre 
felt 
it 
strange 
to 
see 
this
calm, 
indifferent 
crowd 
of 
people 
unaware 
of 
what 
was 
going 
on 
in 
his
soul. 
He 
paced<p>
through 
the 
ballroom, 
waited 
till 
everyone 
had 
come, 
and
as 
Anatole 
had 
not 
turned 
up 
did 
not 
stay 
for 
dinner 
but 
drove 
home.

Anatole, 
for 
whom 
Pierre 
was 
looking, 
dined 
that 
day 
with 
Dolokhov,
consulting 
him 
as 
to 
how 
to 
remedy 
this 
unfortunate 
affair. 
It 
seemed 
to
him 
essential 
to 
see 
Natasha. 
In 
the 
evening 
he 
drove 
to 
his 
sister's
to 
discuss 
with 
her 
how 
to 
arrange 
a 
meeting. 
When 
Pierre 
returned 
home
after 
vainly 
hunting 
all 
over 
Moscow, 
his 
valet 
informed 
him 
that 
Prince
Anatole 
was 
with 
the 
countess. 
The 
countess' 
drawing 
room 
was 
full 
of
guests.

Pierre 
without 
greeting 
his 
wife 
whom 
he 
had 
not 
seen 
since 
his
return-at 
that 
moment 
she 
was 
more 
repulsive 
to 
him 
than 
ever-entered
the 
drawing 
room 
and 
seeing 
Anatole 
went 
up 
to 
him.

"Ah, 
Pierre," 
said 
the 
countess 
going 
up 
to 
her 
husband. 
"You 
don't 
know
what 
a 
plight 
our 
Anatole..."

She 
stopped, 
seeing 
in 
the 
forward 
thrust 
of 
her 
husband's 
head, 
in 
his
glowing 
eyes 
and 
his 
resolute 
gait, 
the 
terrible 
indications 
of 
that
rage 
and 
strength 
which 
she 
knew 
and 
had 
herself 
experienced 
after 
his
duel 
with 
Dolokhov.

"Where 
you 
are, 
there 
is 
vice 
and 
evil!" 
said 
Pierre 
to 
his 
wife.
"Anatole, 
come 
with 
me! 
I 
must 
speak 
to 
you," 
he 
added 
in 
French.

Anatole 
glanced 
round 
at 
his 
sister 
and 
rose 
submissively,<p>
ready 
to
follow 
Pierre. 
Pierre, 
taking 
him 
by 
the 
arm, 
pulled 
him 
toward 
himself
and 
was 
leading 
him 
from 
the 
room.
