the
same 
fifty 
horses 
and 
fifteen 
grooms 
in 
the 
stables, 
the 
same 
expensive
presents 
and 
dinner 
parties 
to 
the 
whole 
district 
on 
name 
days; 
there
were 
still 
the 
count's 
games 
of 
whist 
and 
boston, 
at 
which-spreading
out 
his 
cards 
so 
that 
everybody 
could 
see 
them-he 
let 
himself 
be
plundered 
of 
hundreds 
of 
rubles 
every 
day 
by 
his 
neighbors, 
who 
looked
upon 
an 
opportunity 
to 
play 
a 
rubber 
with 
Count 
Rostov 
as 
a 
most
profitable 
source 
of 
income.

The 
count 
moved 
in 
his 
affairs 
as 
in 
a 
huge<p>
net, 
trying 
not 
to 
believe
that 
he 
was 
entangled 
but 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
so 
at 
every 
step, 
and
feeling 
too 
feeble 
to 
break 
the 
meshes 
or 
to 
set 
to 
work 
carefully 
and
patiently 
to 
disentangle 
them. 
The 
countess, 
with 
her 
loving 
heart, 
felt
that 
her 
children 
were 
being 
ruined, 
that 
it 
was 
not 
the 
count's 
fault
for 
he 
could 
not 
help 
being 
what 
he 
was-that 
(though 
he 
tried 
to
hide 
it) 
he 
himself 
suffered 
from 
the 
consciousness 
of 
his 
own 
and
his 
children's 
ruin, 
and 
she 
tried 
to<p>
find 
means 
of 
remedying 
the
position. 
From 
her 
feminine 
point 
of 
<a href="/cZl/HQ2YmejJ4e1au.html">view</a> 
she 
could 
see 
only 
one
solution, 
namely, 
for 
Nicholas 
to 
marry 
a 
rich 
heiress. 
She 
felt 
this 
to
be 
their 
last 
hope 
and 
that 
if 
Nicholas 
refused 
the 
match 
she 
had 
found
for 
him, 
she 
would 
have 
to 
abandon 
the 
hope 
of 
ever 
getting 
matters
right. 
This 
match 
was 
with 
Julie 
Karagina, 
the 
daughter 
of 
excellent
and 
virtuous 
parents, 
a 
girl 
the 
Rostovs 
had 
known 
from 
childhood, 
and
who 
had 
now 
become 
a 
wealthy 
heiress 
through 
the 
death 
of 
the 
last 
of
her 
brothers.

The 
countess 
had 
written 
direct 
to 
Julie's 
mother 
in 
Moscow 
suggesting
a 
marriage 
between 
their 
children 
and 
had 
received 
a 
favorable 
answer
from 
her. 
Karagina 
had 
replied 
that 
for 
her 
part 
she 
was 
agreeable, 
and
everything 
depend 
on 
her 
daughter's 
inclination. 
She 
invited 
Nicholas
to 
come 
to 
Moscow.

Several 
times 
the 
countess, 
with 
tears 
in 
her 
eyes, 
told 
her 
son 
that
now 
both 
her 
daughters 
were 
settled, 
her 
only 
wish 
was 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ph3wKMFq9Zd9HI.html">see</a> 
him
married. 
She 
said 
she 
could 
lie 
down 
in 
her 
grave 
peacefully 
if 
that
were 
accomplished. 
Then 
she 
told 
him 
that 
she 
knew 
of 
a 
splendid 
girl
and 
tried 
to 
discover 
what 
he 
thought 
about 
marriage.

At 
other 
times 
she 
praised 
Julie 
to 
him 
and 
advised 
him 
to 
go 
to
Moscow 
during 
the 
holidays 
to 
amuse 
himself. 
Nicholas 
guessed 
what 
his
mother's 
remarks 
were 
<a href="/cZl/nHL3COCd3hQrxS2omA.html">leading</a> 
to 
and 
during 
one 
of<p>
these 
conversations
induced 
her 
to 
speak 
quite 
frankly. 
She 
told 
him 
that 
her 
only 
hope
of 
getting 
their 
affairs 
disentangled 
now 
lay 
in 
his 
marrying 
Julie
Karagina.

"But, 
Mamma, 
suppose 
I 
loved 
a 
girl 
who 
has 
no 
fortune, 
would
you 
expect 
me 
to 
sacrifice 
my 
feelings
