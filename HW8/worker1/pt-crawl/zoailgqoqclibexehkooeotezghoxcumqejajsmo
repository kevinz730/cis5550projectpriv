shoulders. 
Pierre 
looked 
solemnly</h1>at 
his
audience 
over 
his 
spectacles 
and 
continued.

"I 
say 
so," 
he 
continued 
desperately, 
"because 
the 
Bourbons 
fled
from 
the 
Revolution 
leaving 
the 
people 
to 
anarchy, 
and 
Napoleon 
alone
understood 
the<p>
Revolution 
and 
quelled 
it, 
and 
so 
for 
the 
general 
good,
he 
could 
not 
stop 
short 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
one 
man's 
life."

"Won't 
you 
come 
over 
to 
the 
other 
table?" 
suggested 
Anna
Pavlovna.

But 
Pierre 
continued 
his 
speech 
without 
heeding 
her.

"No," 
cried 
he, 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
eager, 
"Napoleon 
is 
great
because 
he 
rose 
superior 
to 
the 
Revolution, 
suppressed 
its 
abuses,
preserved 
all 
that 
was 
good 
in 
it-equality 
of 
citizenship 
and 
freedom
of 
speech 
and 
of 
the 
press-and 
only 
for 
that 
reason 
did 
he 
obtain
power."

"Yes, 
if 
having 
obtained 
power, 
without 
availing 
himself 
of 
it 
to
commit 
murder 
he 
had 
restored 
it 
to 
the 
rightful 
king, 
I 
should 
have
called 
him 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/uFR4NuySF7U7.html">a</a> 
great 
man," 
remarked 
the 
vicomte.

"He 
could 
not 
do 
that. 
The 
people 
only 
gave 
him 
power 
that 
he 
might
rid<p>
them<p>
of 
the 
Bourbons 
and 
because 
they 
saw 
that 
he 
was 
a 
great
man. 
The 
Revolution 
was 
a 
grand 
thing!" 
continued 
Monsieur 
Pierre,
betraying 
by 
this 
desperate 
and 
provocative 
proposition 
his 
extreme
youth 
and 
his 
wish 
to 
express 
all 
that 
was 
in 
his 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mM4sVDPn5bE7EwE.html">mind.

"What?</a> 
Revolution 
and 
regicide 
a 
grand 
thing?... 
Well, 
after 
that...
But 
won't 
you 
come 
to 
this 
other 
table?" 
repeated 
Anna 
Pavlovna.

"Rousseau's 
Contrat 
Social," 
said 
the 
vicomte 
with 
a 
tolerant
smile.

"I 
am 
<a href="/aVzUge/vx1R08LZ.html">not</a> 
speaking 
of 
regicide, 
I 
am 
speaking 
about 
ideas."

"Yes: 
ideas 
of 
robbery, 
murder, 
and 
regicide," 
again 
interjected 
an
ironical 
voice.

"Those 
were 
extremes, 
no 
doubt, 
but 
they 
are 
not 
what 
is 
most
important. 
What 
is 
important 
are 
the 
rights 
of 
man, 
emancipation 
from
prejudices, 
and 
equality 
of 
citizenship, 
and 
all 
these 
ideas 
Napoleon
