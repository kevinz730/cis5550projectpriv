had 
any</h1>significance, 
and 
that 
Napoleon 
himself 
would 
be 
ashamed 
of 
them
when 
he 
came 
to 
his<p>
senses. 
Balashev 
stood 
with 
downcast 
eyes, 
looking
at 
the 
movements 
of 
Napoleon's 
stout 
legs 
and 
trying 
to 
avoid 
meeting
his 
eyes.

"But 
what 
do 
I 
care 
about 
your 
allies?" 
said 
Napoleon.<p>
"I 
have
allies-the 
Poles. 
There 
are 
eighty 
thousand 
of 
them 
and 
they 
fight 
like
lions. 
And 
there 
will 
be 
two 
hundred 
thousand 
of 
them."

And 
probably 
still 
more 
perturbed 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
had 
uttered 
this
obvious 
falsehood, 
and 
that 
Balashev 
still 
stood 
silently 
before 
him 
in
the 
same 
attitude 
of 
submission 
to 
fate, 
Napoleon 
abruptly 
turned
round, 
drew 
close<p>
to 
Balashev's 
face, 
and, 
gesticulating 
rapidly 
and
energetically 
with 
his 
white 
hands, 
almost 
shouted:

"Know 
that 
if 
you 
stir 
up 
Prussia 
against 
me, 
I'll 
wipe 
it 
off 
the 
map
of 
Europe!" 
he 
declared, 
his 
face 
pale 
and 
distorted 
by 
anger, 
and 
he
struck 
one 
of 
his 
small 
hands 
energetically 
with 
the 
other. 
"Yes, 
I
will 
throw 
you 
back 
beyond 
the 
Dvina 
and 
beyond 
the 
Dnieper, 
and 
will
re-erect 
against 
you 
that 
barrier 
which 
it 
was 
criminal 
and 
blind 
of
Europe 
to 
allow 
to 
be 
destroyed. 
Yes, 
that 
is 
what<p>
will 
happen 
to 
you.
That 
is 
what 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/VL930gJL.html">you</a> 
have 
gained 
by 
alienating 
me!" 
And 
he 
walked 
silently
several 
times 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room, 
his 
fat 
shoulders 
twitching.

He 
put 
his 
snuffbox<p>
into 
his 
waistcoat 
pocket, 
took 
it 
out 
again, 
lifted
it 
several 
times 
to 
his 
nose, 
and 
stopped 
in 
front 
of 
Balashev. 
He
paused, 
looked 
ironically 
straight 
into 
Balashev's 
eyes, 
and 
said 
in 
a
quiet 
voice:

"And 
yet 
what 
a 
splendid 
reign 
your 
master 
might 
have 
had!"

Balashev, 
feeling 
it<p>
incumbent 
on 
him 
to 
reply, 
said 
that 
from 
the
Russian 
side 
things 
did 
not 
appear 
in 
so 
gloomy 
a 
light. 
Napoleon 
was
silent, 
still 
looking 
derisively 
at<p>
him 
and 
evidently 
not 
listening 
to
him. 
Balashev 
said 
that<p>
in 
Russia 
the 
best 
results 
were 
expected 
from
the 
war. 
Napoleon 
nodded 
condescendingly, 
as 
if 
to 
say, 
"I 
know 
it's
your 
duty 
to 
say 
that, 
but 
you 
don't 
believe 
it 
yourself. 
I 
have
convinced 
you."

When 
Balashev 
had 
ended, 
Napoleon 
again 
took 
out 
his 
snuffbox, 
sniffed
at 
it, 
and 
stamped 
his 
<a href="/cZl/uq9lLv1pbE7a.html">foot</a> 
twice 
on 
the 
floor 
as 
a 
signal. 
The 
door
opened, 
a 
gentleman-in-waiting, 
bending 
respectfully, 
handed 
the 
Emperor
his 
hat 
and 
gloves; 
another 
brought 
him 
a 
pocket 
handkerchief. 
Napoleon,
without 
giving 
them 
a 
glance, 
turned 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mT8QrO73Bh.html">Balashev:

"Assure</a> 
the 
Emperor 
Alexander 
from 
me," 
said 
he, 
taking 
his 
hat, 
"that
I 
am 
as 
devoted 
to 
him 
as 
before: 
I
