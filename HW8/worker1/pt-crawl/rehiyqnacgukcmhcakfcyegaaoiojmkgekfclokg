Bennigsen, 
who, 
like 
all</h1>on 
whom 
Boris
had 
been 
in 
attendance, 
considered 
young 
Prince 
Drubetskoy 
an 
invaluable
man.

In 
the 
higher 
command 
there 
were 
two 
sharply 
defined 
parties: 
Kutuzov's
party 
and 
that 
of 
Bennigsen, 
the 
chief 
of 
staff. 
Boris 
belonged 
to 
the
latter 
and 
no 
one 
else, 
while 
showing 
servile 
respect 
to 
Kutuzov, 
could
so 
create 
an 
impression 
that 
the 
old 
fellow 
was 
<a href="/cZl/PU4bKMVG07ZR.html">not</a> 
much 
good 
and 
that
Bennigsen 
managed 
everything. 
Now 
the 
decisive 
moment 
of 
battle 
had 
come
when 
Kutuzov 
would<p>
be 
destroyed 
and 
the 
power 
pass 
to 
Bennigsen, 
or 
even
if 
<a href="/aVzUge/wm8HI4Uo5Q.html">Kutuzov</a> 
won 
the 
battle 
it 
would 
be 
felt 
that 
everything 
was 
done 
by
Bennigsen. 
In 
any 
case 
many 
great 
rewards 
would 
have 
to 
be 
given 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/qm8As2CMvYt8FlpJ.html">for
tomorrow's</a> 
<a href="/cZl/Qc8mJ71Uo.html">action,</a> 
and 
new 
men 
would 
come 
to 
the 
front. 
So 
Boris 
was
full 
of 
nervous 
vivacity 
all 
day.

After 
Kaysarov, 
others 
whom 
Pierre 
knew 
came 
up 
to 
him, 
and 
he 
had 
not
time 
to 
reply 
to 
all 
the 
questions 
about 
Moscow 
that 
were 
showered 
upon
him, 
or 
to 
listen 
to 
all 
that 
was 
told 
him. 
The 
faces 
all 
expressed
animation 
and 
apprehension, 
but<p>
it 
seemed 
to 
Pierre 
that 
the 
cause 
of
the 
excitement 
shown 
in 
some 
of 
these 
faces 
lay 
chiefly 
in 
questions
of 
personal 
success; 
his 
mind, 
however, 
was 
occupied 
by 
the 
different
expression 
he 
saw<p>
on 
other 
faces-an 
expression 
that 
spoke 
not 
of
personal 
matters 
but 
of 
the 
universal 
questions 
of 
life 
and 
death.
Kutuzov 
noticed 
Pierre's 
figure 
and 
the 
group 
gathered 
round 
him.

"Call 
him 
to 
me," 
said 
Kutuzov.

adjutant

Pierre
