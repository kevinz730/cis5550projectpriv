for 
a 
two 
hours' 
drive, 
and 
rarely
drove 
himself, 
generally 
letting 
his 
young 
men 
do 
so. 
But 
with 
"his
gentlemen" 
he 
always 
drove 
himself 
and 
never 
demanded 
anything 
for
his 
work. 
Only 
a 
couple 
of 
times 
a 
year-when 
he 
knew 
from 
their 
valets
that 
they 
had 
money 
in 
hand-he 
would 
turn 
up 
of 
a<p>
morning 
quite 
sober
and 
with 
a 
deep 
bow 
would 
ask 
them 
to 
help 
him. 
The 
gentlemen 
always
made 
him 
sit 
down.

"Do 
help<p>
me 
out, 
Theodore 
Ivanych, 
sir," 
or 
"your 
excellency,"
he 
would 
say. 
"I 
am 
quite 
out 
of 
horses. 
Let 
me 
have 
what 
you 
can 
to
go 
to 
the 
fair."

And<p>
Anatole 
and 
Dolokhov, 
when 
they 
had 
money, 
would 
give 
him 
a
thousand 
or 
a 
couple 
of 
thousand 
rubles.

Balaga 
was 
a 
fair-haired, 
short, 
and 
snub-nosed 
peasant 
of 
about
twenty-seven; 
red-faced, 
with 
a 
particularly 
red 
thick 
neck, 
glittering
little 
eyes, 
and 
a 
small 
beard. 
He 
wore 
a 
fine, 
dark-blue, 
silk-lined
cloth 
coat 
over 
a 
sheepskin.

On 
entering 
the 
room 
now 
he<p>
crossed 
himself, 
turning 
toward 
the 
front
corner 
of 
the 
room, 
and 
went 
up 
to 
Dolokhov, 
holding 
out 
a 
small, 
black
hand.

"Theodore 
Ivanych!" 
he 
said, 
bowing.

"How 
d'you 
do, 
friend? 
Well, 
here 
he 
is!"

"Good 
day, 
your 
excellency!" 
he 
said, 
again 
holding 
out 
his 
hand 
to
Anatole 
who 
had 
just 
come 
in.

"I 
say, 
Balaga," 
said 
Anatole, 
putting 
his 
hands 
on 
the 
man's
shoulders, 
"do 
you 
care 
for 
me 
or 
not? 
Eh? 
Now, 
do 
me<p>
a 
service....
What 
horses 
have 
you 
come 
with? 
Eh?"

"As 
your 
messenger 
ordered, 
your 
special 
beasts," 
replied 
Balaga.

"Well, 
listen, 
Balaga! 
Drive 
all 
three 
to 
death 
but 
get 
me 
there 
in
three 
hours. 
Eh?"

"When 
they 
are 
dead, 
what 
shall 
I 
drive?" 
said 
Balaga 
with 
a 
wink.

"Mind, 
I'll 
smash 
your 
face 
in! 
Don't 
make 
jokes!" 
cried
Anatole, 
suddenly 
rolling 
his 
eyes.

"Why 
joke?" 
said 
the 
driver, 
laughing. 
"As 
if 
I'd 
grudge 
my
gentlemen 
anything! 
As 
fast 
as 
ever 
the 
horses 
can 
gallop, 
so 
fast
we'll 
go!"

"Ah!" 
said 
Anatole. 
"Well, 
sit 
down."

"Yes, 
sit 
down!" 
said
