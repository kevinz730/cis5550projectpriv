the 
chief 
source 
of 
all 
error 
and
evil. 
Le 
prochain-your 
Kiev 
peasants 
to 
whom 
you 
want 
to 
do 
good."

And<p>
he 
looked 
at 
Pierre 
with 
a 
mocking, 
challenging 
expression. 
He
evidently 
wished 
to 
draw 
him 
on.

"You 
are<p>
joking," 
replied 
Pierre, 
growing 
more 
and 
more 
excited.
"What 
error 
or 
evil 
can 
there 
be 
in 
my 
wishing 
to 
do 
good, 
and 
even
doing 
a 
little-though 
I 
did 
very 
little 
and 
did 
it 
very 
badly? 
What
evil 
can 
there 
be 
in 
it 
if 
unfortunate 
people, 
our 
serfs, 
people 
like
ourselves, 
were 
growing 
up 
and 
dying 
with 
no 
idea 
of 
God 
and 
truth
beyond 
ceremonies 
and 
meaningless 
prayers 
and 
are 
now 
instructed 
in
a 
comforting 
belief 
in 
future 
life, 
retribution, 
recompense, 
and
consolation? 
What 
evil 
and 
error 
are 
there 
in 
it, 
if 
people 
were 
dying
of 
disease 
without 
help 
while 
material 
assistance 
could 
so 
easily 
be
rendered, 
and 
I 
supplied 
them 
with 
a 
doctor, 
a 
hospital, 
and 
an 
asylum
for 
the 
aged? 
And 
is 
it 
not 
a 
palpable, 
unquestionable 
good 
if 
a
peasant, 
or 
a 
woman<p>
with 
a 
baby, 
has 
no 
rest 
day 
or 
night 
and 
I 
give
them 
rest 
and 
leisure?" 
said 
Pierre, 
hurrying 
and 
lisping. 
"And
I 
have 
done 
that 
though 
badly 
and 
to 
a 
small 
extent; 
but 
I 
have 
done
something 
toward 
it 
and 
you 
cannot 
persuade 
me 
that 
it 
was 
not 
a 
good
action, 
and 
more 
than 
that, 
you 
can't 
make 
me 
believe 
that 
you 
do 
not
think 
so 
yourself. 
And 
the 
main 
thing 
is," 
he 
continued, 
"that 
I
know, 
and 
know 
for 
certain, 
that 
the 
enjoyment 
of 
doing 
this 
good 
is 
the
only 
sure 
happiness 
in 
life."

"Yes, 
if 
you 
put 
it 
like 
that 
it's 
quite 
<a href="/cZl/CW1H0D5ZhuM.html">a</a> 
different 
matter," 
said
Prince 
Andrew. 
"I 
build 
a 
house 
and 
lay 
out 
a 
garden, 
and 
you 
build
hospitals. 
The 
one 
and 
the 
other 
may 
serve 
as 
a 
pastime. 
But 
what's
right 
and 
what's 
good 
must 
be 
judged 
by 
one 
who 
knows 
all, 
but 
not 
by
us. 
Well, 
you 
want 
an 
argument," 
he 
added, 
"come 
on 
then."

They 
rose 
from 
the 
table 
and 
sat 
down 
in 
the 
entrance 
porch 
which 
served
as 
a 
veranda.

"Come, 
let's 
argue 
then," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"You 
talk 
of
schools," 
he 
went 
on, 
crooking 
a 
finger, 
"education 
and 
so 
forth;
that 
is, 
you 
want 
to 
raise 
him" 
(pointing 
to 
a 
peasant 
who 
passed 
by
them 
taking 
off 
his 
cap) 
"from 
his 
animal 
condition 
and 
awaken 
in 
him
spiritual 
needs, 
while 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
that 
animal 
happiness 
is 
the 
only
happiness 
possible, 
and 
that 
is 
just 
what 
you 
want 
to 
deprive 
him 
of.
I 
envy 
him, 
but 
you 
want 
to 
make 
him 
what 
I 
am, 
without 
giving 
him 
my
means. 
Then 
you 
say, 
'lighten 
his 
toil.' 
But 
as 
I 
see 
it, 
physical
labor 
is 
as 
essential 
to 
him, 
as 
much 
a 
condition 
of 
his 
existence, 
as
mental 
activity 
is 
to 
you 
or 
me. 
You 
can't 
help 
thinking. 
I 
go 
to 
bed
after 
two 
in 
the 
morning, 
thoughts 
come 
and 
I 
can't 
sleep 
but 
toss
about 
till 
dawn, 
because 
I 
think 
and 
can't 
help 
thinking, 
just 
as
he 
can't 
help 
plowing 
and 
mowing; 
if 
he 
didn't, 
he 
would 
go 
to 
the
drink 
shop 
or 
fall 
ill. 
Just 
as 
I 
could 
not 
stand 
his 
terrible 
physical
labor 
but 
should 
die 
of 
it 
in 
a 
week, 
so 
he 
could 
not 
stand 
my 
physical
idleness, 
but 
would 
grow 
fat 
and 
die. 
The 
third 
thing-what 
else 
was
it 
you 
talked 
about?" 
and 
Prince 
Andrew 
crooked 
a 
third 
finger. 
"Ah,
yes, 
hospitals, 
medicine. 
He 
has 
a 
fit, 
he 
is 
dying, 
and 
you 
come 
and
bleed 
him 
and 
patch 
him 
up. 
He 
will 
drag 
about 
as 
a 
cripple, 
a 
burden 
to
everybody, 
for 
another<p>
ten 
years. 
It 
would 
be 
far 
easier 
and 
simpler 
for
him 
to 
die. 
Others 
are 
being 
born 
and 
there 
are 
plenty 
of 
them 
as 
it 
is.
It 
would 
be 
different 
if 
you 
grudged 
losing 
a 
laborer-that's 
how 
I
regard 
him-but 
you 
want 
to 
cure 
him 
from 
love 
of 
<a href="/cZl/mT2R8XKBx3.html">him.</a> 
And 
he 
does 
not
want 
that. 
And 
besides, 
what 
a 
notion 
that 
medicine 
ever 
cured 
anyone!
Killed 
them, 
yes!" 
said 
he, 
frowning 
angrily 
and 
turning
