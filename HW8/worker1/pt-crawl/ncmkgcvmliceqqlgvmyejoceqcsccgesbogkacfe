men 
who 
have 
come 
out</h1>to 
fight 
a 
duel 
with<p>
rapiers
according 
to 
all 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
art 
of 
fencing. 
The 
fencing 
has
gone 
on 
for 
some 
time; 
suddenly 
one 
of 
the 
combatants, 
feeling 
himself
wounded 
and<p>
understanding 
that 
the 
matter 
is 
no 
joke 
but 
concerns<p>
his
life, 
throws 
down 
his 
rapier, 
and 
seizing 
the 
first 
cudgel 
that 
comes 
to
hand 
begins 
to 
brandish 
it. 
Then 
let 
us 
imagine 
that 
the 
combatant 
who
so 
sensibly 
employed 
the 
best 
and 
simplest 
means 
to 
attain 
his 
end 
was
at 
the 
same 
time 
influenced 
by 
traditions 
of 
chivalry 
and, 
desiring 
to
conceal 
the 
facts 
of 
the 
case, 
insisted 
that 
he 
had 
gained 
his 
victory
with 
the 
rapier 
according 
to 
all 
the 
rules 
of 
art. 
One 
can 
imagine 
what
confusion 
and 
obscurity 
would 
result 
from 
such 
an 
account 
of 
the 
duel.

The 
fencer<p>
who 
demanded 
a 
contest 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
fencing 
was
the 
French 
army; 
his 
opponent 
who 
threw 
away 
the 
rapier 
and 
snatched 
up
the 
cudgel 
was 
the 
Russian 
people; 
those 
who 
try 
to 
explain 
the 
matter
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
fencing 
are 
the 
historians 
who 
have 
described
the 
event.

After 
the 
burning 
of 
Smolensk 
a 
war 
began 
which 
did 
not 
follow 
any
previous 
traditions 
of 
war. 
The 
burning 
of 
towns 
and 
villages, 
the
retreats 
after 
battles, 
the 
blow 
dealt<p>
at 
Borodino 
and 
the 
renewed
retreat, 
the 
burning 
of 
Moscow, 
the 
capture 
of 
marauders, 
the 
seizure 
of
transports, 
and 
the 
guerrilla 
war 
were 
all 
departures 
from 
the 
rules.

Napoleon 
felt 
this, 
and 
from 
the 
time 
he 
took 
up 
the 
correct 
fencing
attitude 
in 
Moscow 
and 
instead 
of 
his 
opponent's 
rapier 
saw 
a 
cudgel
raised 
above 
his 
head, 
he 
did 
not 
cease 
to 
complain 
to 
Kutuzov 
and 
to
the 
Emperor 
Alexander 
that 
the 
war 
was 
being 
carried 
on 
contrary 
to 
all
the 
rules-as 
if 
there 
were 
any 
rules 
for 
killing 
people. 
In 
spite 
of 
the
complaints 
of 
the 
French 
as 
to 
the 
nonobservance 
of 
the 
rules, 
in
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
to 
some 
highly 
placed 
Russians 
it 
seemed 
rather
disgraceful 
to 
fight 
with 
a 
cudgel 
and 
they 
wanted 
to 
assume 
a 
pose 
en
quarte 
or 
en 
tierce 
according 
to 
all 
the 
rules, 
and 
to 
make 
an 
adroit
thrust 
en 
prime, 
and 
so 
on-the 
cudgel 
of 
the 
people's 
war 
was 
lifted
with 
all 
its 
menacing 
and 
majestic 
strength, 
and 
without<p>
consulting
anyone's 
tastes 
or 
rules 
and 
regardless 
of 
anything 
else, 
it 
rose 
and
fell 
with 
stupid 
simplicity, 
but 
consistently, 
and 
belabored 
the 
French
till 
the 
whole 
invasion 
had 
perished.

And 
it 
is 
well 
for 
a 
people 
who 
do 
not-as 
the 
French 
did 
in 
1813-salute
according 
to 
all 
the 
rules 
of 
art, 
and, 
presenting 
the 
hilt 
of 
their
rapier 
gracefully 
and 
politely, 
hand 
it 
to 
their 
magnanimous 
conqueror,
but 
at 
the 
moment 
of 
trial, 
without 
asking 
what 
rules 
others 
have
adopted 
in 
similar 
cases, 
simply 
and 
easily 
pick 
up 
the 
first 
cudgel
that 
comes 
to 
hand 
and 
strike 
with 
it 
till 
the 
feeling 
of 
resentment 
and
revenge 
in 
their 
soul 
yields 
to 
a 
feeling 
of 
contempt 
and 
compassion.





CHAPTER 
II

One 
of 
the 
most 
obvious 
and 
advantageous 
departures 
from 
the 
so-called
laws 
of 
war 
is 
the 
action 
of 
scattered 
groups 
against 
men 
pressed
together 
in 
a 
mass. 
Such 
action 
always 
occurs 
in 
wars 
that 
take 
on 
a
national 
character. 
In 
such 
actions, 
instead 
of 
two 
crowds 
opposing
each 
other, 
the 
men 
disperse, 
attack 
singly, 
run 
away 
when 
attacked 
by
stronger 
forces, 
but 
again 
attack 
when 
opportunity 
offers. 
This 
was 
done
by 
the 
guerrillas 
in 
Spain, 
by 
the<p>
mountain 
tribes 
in 
the 
Caucasus, 
and
by 
the 
Russians 
in 
1812.

People 
have 
called 
this 
kind 
of 
war 
"guerrilla 
warfare" 
and
