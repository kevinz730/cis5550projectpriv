with
his 
wife, 
and 
by 
an</h1>anonymous 
letter 
he 
had 
received 
that 
morning, 
which
in 
the 
mean 
jocular 
way 
common 
to 
anonymous 
letters 
said 
that 
he 
saw
badly 
through 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Kt1fqZYy6E2U.html">his</a> 
spectacles, 
but 
that 
his 
wife's<p>
connection 
with
Dolokhov 
was 
a 
secret 
to 
no 
one 
but 
<a href="/aVzUge/vP8AF3pDix7CBzhL.html">himself.</a> 
Pierre 
absolutely
disbelieved 
both 
the 
princess' 
hints 
and 
the 
letter,<p>
but 
he 
feared
now 
to 
look 
at 
Dolokhov, 
who 
was 
sitting 
opposite 
him. 
Every 
time
he 
chanced 
to 
meet 
Dolokhov's 
handsome 
insolent 
eyes, 
Pierre 
felt
something 
terrible 
and 
monstrous 
rising 
in 
his 
soul 
and 
turned 
quickly
away. 
Involuntarily 
recalling 
his 
wife's 
past 
and 
her 
relations 
with
Dolokhov, 
Pierre 
saw 
clearly 
that 
what 
was 
said 
in 
the 
letter 
might 
be
true, 
or 
might 
at 
least 
seem<p>
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ovD8iLv86kW.html">to</a> 
be 
true 
had 
it 
not 
referred 
to 
his 
wife.
