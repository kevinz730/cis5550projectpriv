and</h1>he 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
bullets
whistling, 
singing, 
and 
hissing 
continually 
around 
them. 
He 
spoke 
in 
the
tone 
of 
entreaty 
and 
reproach 
that 
a 
carpenter 
uses 
to 
a 
gentleman 
who
has 
picked 
up 
an 
ax: 
"We 
are 
used 
to 
it, 
but 
you, 
sir, 
will 
blister
your 
hands." 
He 
spoke 
as 
if 
those 
bullets 
could 
not 
kill 
him, 
and 
his
half-closed 
eyes 
gave 
still 
more 
persuasiveness 
to 
his 
words. 
The 
staff
officer 
joined 
in 
the 
colonel's 
appeals, 
but 
Bagration 
did 
not 
reply;
he 
only 
gave 
an 
order 
to 
cease 
firing 
and 
re-form, 
so 
as 
to 
give 
room
for 
the 
two 
approaching 
battalions. 
While 
he 
was 
speaking, 
the 
curtain
of 
smoke 
that 
had 
concealed 
the 
hollow, 
driven 
by 
a 
rising 
wind, 
began
to 
move 
from 
right 
to 
left 
as 
if 
drawn 
by 
an 
invisible 
hand, 
and 
the
hill 
opposite, 
with 
the 
French 
moving 
about 
on 
it, 
opened 
out 
before
them. 
All 
eyes 
fastened 
involuntarily 
on 
this 
French 
column 
advancing
against 
them 
and 
winding 
down 
over 
the 
uneven 
ground. 
One 
could 
already
see 
the 
soldiers' 
shaggy 
caps, 
distinguish 
the 
officers 
from 
the 
men,
and 
see 
the 
standard 
flapping 
against 
its 
staff.

"They 
march 
splendidly," 
remarked 
someone 
in 
Bagration's 
suite.

The 
head 
of 
the 
column 
had 
already 
descended 
into 
the 
hollow. 
The 
clash
would 
take 
place 
on 
this 
side 
of 
it...

The 
remains 
of 
our 
regiment 
which 
had 
been 
in 
action 
rapidly 
formed 
up
and 
moved 
to 
the 
right; 
from 
behind 
it, 
dispersing 
the 
laggards, 
came
two 
battalions 
of 
the 
Sixth 
Chasseurs 
in 
fine 
order. 
Before 
they 
had
reached 
Bagration, 
the 
weighty 
tread 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
men 
marching 
in
step 
could 
be 
heard. 
On 
their 
left 
flank, 
nearest 
to 
Bagration, 
marched
a 
company 
commander, 
a 
fine 
round-faced 
man, 
with 
a 
stupid 
and 
happy
expression-the 
same 
man 
who 
had 
rushed 
out 
of 
the 
wattle 
shed. 
At 
that
moment 
he 
was 
clearly 
thinking 
of 
nothing 
but 
how 
dashing 
a 
fellow 
he
would 
appear 
as 
he 
passed 
the 
commander.

With 
the 
self-satisfaction 
of 
a 
man 
on 
parade, 
he 
stepped 
lightly 
with
his 
muscular 
legs 
as 
if 
sailing 
along, 
stretching 
himself 
to 
his 
full
height 
without 
the 
smallest 
effort, 
his 
ease 
contrasting 
with 
the 
heavy
tread 
of 
the 
soldiers 
who 
were 
keeping 
step 
with 
him. 
He 
carried 
close
to 
his 
leg 
a 
narrow 
unsheathed 
sword 
(small, 
curved, 
and 
not 
like 
a 
real
weapon) 
and 
looked 
now 
at 
the 
superior 
officers
