arrived 
and 
the 
pulley 
of
the 
hall 
door 
squeaked 
from 
the 
cold 
as 
it 
let 
in 
the 
Rostovs 
and 
their
servants. 
Marya 
Dmitrievna, 
with 
her 
spectacles 
hanging 
down 
on 
her
nose 
and 
her 
head 
flung 
back, 
stood 
in 
the 
hall 
doorway 
looking 
<a href="/cZl/XH6HV6It6R.html">with
a</a> 
stern, 
grim 
face 
at 
the 
new 
arrivals. 
One 
might 
have 
thought 
she 
was
angry 
with 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/jM6iPTJ0.html">travelers</a> 
and 
would 
immediately 
turn 
them 
out, 
had 
she
not 
at 
the 
same 
time 
been 
giving 
careful 
instructions 
to 
the 
servants
for 
the 
accommodation 
of 
the 
visitors 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oX6yf9Cr1gAzo.html">their</a> 
belongings.

"The 
count's 
things? 
Bring 
them 
here," 
she 
said, 
pointing 
to 
the
portmanteaus 
and 
not 
greeting 
anyone. 
"The 
young 
ladies'? 
There
to 
the 
left. 
Now 
what 
are 
you 
dawdling 
for?" 
she 
cried 
to 
the 
maids.
"Get 
the 
samovar 
ready!... 
You've 
grown 
plumper 
and 
prettier," 
she
remarked, 
drawing 
Natasha 
(whose 
cheeks 
were 
glowing 
from 
the 
cold)
to 
her 
by 
the 
hood. 
"Foo! 
You 
are 
cold! 
Now 
take 
off 
your 
things,
quick!" 
she 
shouted 
to 
the 
count 
who 
was 
going 
to 
kiss 
her 
hand.
"You're 
half 
frozen, 
I'm 
sure! 
Bring 
some 
rum 
for 
tea!... 
Bonjour,
Sonya 
dear!" 
she 
added, 
turning 
to 
Sonya 
and 
indicating 
by 
this
French 
greeting 
her 
slightly 
contemptuous 
though 
affectionate 
attitude
toward 
her.

When 
they 
came 
in 
to 
tea, 
having 
taken 
off 
their 
outdoor 
things 
and
tidied 
themselves 
up 
after 
their 
journey, 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
kissed 
them
all 
in 
due 
order.

"I'm 
heartily 
glad 
you 
have 
come 
and 
are 
staying 
with 
me. 
It 
was
high 
time," 
she 
said, 
giving 
Natasha 
a 
significant 
look. 
"The 
old
man 
is 
here 
and 
his 
son's 
expected 
any 
day. 
You'll 
have 
to<p>
make 
his
acquaintance. 
But 
we'll 
speak 
of 
that 
later 
on," 
she 
added, 
glancing
at 
Sonya 
with 
a 
look 
that 
showed 
she 
did 
not 
want 
to 
speak 
of 
it 
in 
her
presence. 
"Now 
listen," 
she 
said 
to 
the 
count. 
"What 
do 
you 
want
tomorrow?
