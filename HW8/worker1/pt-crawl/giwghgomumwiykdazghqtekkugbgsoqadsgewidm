He

CHAPTER 
XVII

After 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
had 
driven 
off 
with 
her 
son 
to 
visit 
Count 
Cyril
Vladimirovich 
Bezukhov, 
Countess 
Rostova 
sat 
for 
a 
long 
time 
all
alone 
applying 
her 
handkerchief 
to 
her 
eyes. 
At 
last 
she 
rang.

"What 
is 
the 
matter 
with 
you, 
my 
dear?" 
she 
said 
crossly 
to 
the 
maid
who 
kept 
her 
waiting 
some 
minutes. 
"Don't 
you 
wish 
to 
serve 
me? 
Then
I'll 
find 
you 
another 
place."

The 
countess 
was 
upset 
by 
her 
friend's 
sorrow 
and 
humiliating 
poverty,
and 
was 
therefore 
out 
of 
sorts, 
a 
state 
of 
mind 
which 
with 
her 
always
found 
expression 
in 
calling 
her 
maid 
"my<p>
dear" 
and 
speaking 
to 
her
with 
exaggerated 
politeness.

"I 
am 
very 
sorry, 
ma'am,"
