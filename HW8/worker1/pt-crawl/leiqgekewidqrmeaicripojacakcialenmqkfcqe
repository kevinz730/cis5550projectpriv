he 
said,</h1>growing 
suddenly
pale, 
and 
added, 
"Look 
at 
it, 
young<p>
man."

Rostov 
took 
the 
purse 
in 
his 
hand, 
examined 
it 
and 
the 
money 
in 
it, 
and
looked 
at 
Telyanin. 
The 
lieutenant 
was 
looking 
about 
in 
his 
usual 
way
and 
suddenly 
seemed 
to 
grow 
very 
merry.

"If 
we 
get 
to 
Vienna 
I'll 
get 
rid 
of 
it 
there 
but 
in 
these 
wretched
little 
towns 
there's 
nowhere 
to 
spend 
it," 
said 
he. 
"Well, 
let 
me
have 
it, 
young 
man, 
I'm 
going."

Rostov<p>
did 
not 
speak.

"And 
you? 
Are 
you 
going 
to 
have 
lunch 
too? 
They 
feed 
you 
quite
decently 
here," 
continued 
Telyanin. 
<a href="/aVzUge/Wx2ReoD1oqP.html">"Now</a> 
then, 
let 
me 
have 
it."

He 
stretched 
out 
his 
hand 
to 
take 
hold 
of 
the 
purse. 
Rostov 
let 
go 
of
it. 
Telyanin 
took 
the 
purse 
and 
began 
carelessly 
slipping 
it 
into 
the
pocket 
of 
his 
riding 
breeches, 
with 
his 
eyebrows 
lifted 
and 
his 
mouth
slightly 
open, 
as 
if 
to 
say, 
"Yes, 
yes, 
I 
am 
putting 
my 
purse 
in 
my
pocket 
and 
that's 
quite 
simple 
and 
is 
no 
one 
else's 
business."

"Well, 
young 
man?" 
he 
said 
with 
a 
sigh, 
and 
from 
under 
his 
lifted
brows 
he 
glanced 
into 
Rostov's 
eyes.

Some 
flash 
as 
of 
an 
electric 
spark 
shot 
from 
Telyanin's 
eyes 
to
Rostov's 
and 
back, 
and 
back 
again 
and 
again 
in 
an 
instant.

"Come 
here," 
said 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rg15uFRs2Qc.html">Rostov,</a> 
catching 
hold 
of<p>
Telyanin's 
arm 
and
almost 
dragging 
him 
to 
the 
window. 
"That 
money 
is 
Denisov's; 
you
took 
it..." 
he 
whispered 
just 
above 
Telyanin's 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oUZ59J1bI.html">ear.

"What?</a> 
What? 
How 
dare 
you? 
What?" 
said 
Telyanin.

But 
these 
words 
came 
like 
a 
piteous, 
despairing 
cry 
and 
an 
entreaty 
for
pardon. 
As 
soon 
as 
Rostov 
heard 
them, 
an 
enormous 
load 
of 
doubt
fell 
from 
him. 
He 
was 
glad, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
instant 
began 
to 
pity 
the
miserable 
man 
who 
stood 
before 
him, 
but 
the 
task 
he 
had 
begun 
had 
to 
be
completed.

"Heaven 
only 
knows 
what 
the 
people 
here 
may 
imagine," 
muttered
Telyanin, 
taking 
up 
his 
cap 
and 
moving 
toward 
a 
small 
empty 
room. 
"We
must 
have 
an 
explanation..."

"I 
know 
it 
and 
shall 
prove 
it," 
said 
Rostov.

"I..."

Every 
muscle 
of 
Telyanin's 
pale, 
terrified 
face 
began 
to 
quiver, 
his
eyes 
still 
shifted 
from 
side 
to 
side 
but 
with 
a 
downward 
look 
not 
rising
to 
Rostov's 
face, 
and 
his 
sobs 
were 
audible.

"Count!... 
Don't
