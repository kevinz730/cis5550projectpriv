kissed 
the 
beautiful
Helene's</h1>hand 
several 
times. 
After 
a 
while 
they 
were 
left 
alone
again.

"All 
this 
had 
to 
be 
and 
could 
not 
be 
otherwise," 
thought 
Pierre,
"so 
it 
is 
useless 
to 
ask 
whether 
it 
is 
good 
or 
bad. 
It 
is 
good 
because
it's 
definite 
and 
one 
is 
rid 
of 
the 
old 
tormenting 
doubt." 
Pierre
held 
the 
hand 
of 
his 
betrothed 
in 
silence, 
looking 
at 
her 
beautiful
bosom 
as 
it 
rose 
and 
fell.

"Helene!" 
he 
said 
aloud 
and 
paused.

"Something 
special 
is 
always 
said 
in 
such 
cases," 
he 
thought, 
but
could 
not 
remember 
what 
it 
was 
that 
people 
say. 
He 
looked 
at 
her 
face.
She 
drew 
nearer 
to 
him. 
Her 
face 
flushed.

"Oh, 
take 
those 
off... 
those..." 
she 
said,<p>
pointing 
to 
his
spectacles.

Pierre 
took 
them 
off, 
and 
his 
eyes, 
besides 
the 
strange 
look 
eyes 
have
from 
which 
spectacles 
have 
just 
been 
removed, 
had 
also 
a 
frightened 
and
inquiring 
look. 
He 
was 
about 
to 
stoop 
over 
her 
hand 
and 
kiss 
it, 
but
with 
a 
rapid, 
almost 
brutal 
movement 
of 
her 
head, 
she 
intercepted 
his
lips 
and 
met 
them 
with 
her 
own. 
Her 
face 
struck 
Pierre, 
by 
its 
altered,
unpleasantly 
excited 
expression.

"It 
is 
too 
late 
now, 
it's 
done; 
besides 
I 
love 
her," 
thought
Pierre.

"Je 
vous 
aime!" 
* 
he 
said, 
remembering 
what 
has 
to 
be 
said 
at 
such
moments: 
but 
his 
words 
sounded 
so 
weak 
that 
he 
felt 
ashamed 
of 
himself.

 
 
 
 
* 
"I 
love 
you."


Six 
weeks 
later 
he 
was 
married, 
and 
settled 
in 
Count 
Bezukhov's
large, 
newly 
furnished 
Petersburg 
house, 
the 
happy 
possessor,

CHAPTER 
III

Old 
Prince 
Nicholas 
Bolkonski 
received 
a 
letter 
from 
Prince 
Vasili
in 
November, 
1805, 
announcing 
that 
he 
and 
his 
son 
would 
be 
paying 
him
a 
visit. 
"I 
am 
starting 
on 
a 
journey 
of 
inspection, 
and 
of 
course 
I
shall 
think 
nothing 
of 
an 
extra 
seventy 
miles 
to 
come 
and 
see 
you 
at
the 
same 
time, 
my 
honored 
benefactor," 
wrote 
Prince 
Vasili. 
"My 
son
Anatole 
is 
accompanying 
me 
on 
his 
way 
to 
the 
army, 
so 
I 
hope 
you 
will
allow 
him 
personally 
to 
express 
the 
deep 
respect 
that, 
emulating 
his
father, 
he 
feels 
for 
you."

"It 
seems 
that 
there 
will 
be 
no 
need 
to 
bring 
Mary 
out, 
suitors 
are
coming 
to 
us 
of 
their 
own 
accord," 
incautiously 
remarked 
the 
little
princess 
on 
hearing 
the 
news.

Prince 
Nicholas 
frowned, 
but 
said 
nothing.

A 
fortnight 
after 
the 
letter 
Prince 
Vasili's 
servants 
came 
one
evening 
in 
advance 
of 
him, 
and 
he 
and 
his 
son 
arrived 
next 
day.

Old 
Bolkonski 
had 
always 
had 
a 
poor 
opinion 
of 
Prince 
Vasili's
character, 
but 
more 
so 
recently, 
since 
in 
the 
new 
reigns 
of 
Paul 
and
Alexander 
Prince 
Vasili 
had 
risen 
to 
high<p>
position 
and 
honors. 
And 
now,
from 
the 
hints 
contained 
in 
his 
letter 
and 
given 
by 
the 
little 
princess,
he 
saw 
which 
way 
the 
wind 
was 
blowing, 
and 
his 
low 
opinion 
changed 
into
a 
feeling 
of 
contemptuous 
ill 
will. 
He 
snorted 
whenever 
he 
mentioned
him. 
On 
the 
day 
of 
Prince 
Vasili's 
arrival, 
Prince 
Bolkonski 
was
particularly 
discontented 
and 
out 
of 
temper. 
Whether 
he 
was 
in 
a 
bad
temper 
because 
Prince 
Vasili 
was 
coming, 
or 
whether 
his 
being 
in 
a 
bad
temper<p>
made 
him 
specially 
annoyed 
at 
Prince 
Vasili's 
visit, 
he 
was
in 
a 
bad 
temper, 
and 
in 
the 
morning 
Tikhon 
had 
already 
advised 
the
architect 
not 
to 
go 
to 
the<p>
prince 
with 
his 
report.

"Do 
you 
hear 
how 
he's 
walking?" 
said 
Tikhon, 
drawing 
the
architect's 
attention 
to 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
prince's 
footsteps.
"Stepping 
flat 
on 
his 
heels-we 
know 
what 
that 
means...."

However, 
at 
nine 
o'clock 
the 
prince, 
in 
his 
velvet 
coat 
with 
a 
sable
collar 
and 
cap, 
went 
out 
for 
his 
usual 
walk. 
It 
had 
snowed 
the 
day
before 
and 
the 
path 
to 
the 
hothouse,
