The 
Russian 
war 
should 
have 
been 
the 
most 
popular 
war 
of 
modern 
times:
it 
was 
a 
war 
of 
good 
sense, 
for 
real 
interests, 
for 
the 
tranquillity<p>
and
security 
of 
all; 
it 
was 
purely 
pacific 
and 
conservative.

It 
was<p>
a 
war 
for 
a<p>
great 
cause, 
the 
end 
of 
uncertainties 
and 
the
beginning 
of 
security. 
A 
new 
horizon 
and 
new 
labors 
were 
opening 
out,
full 
of 
well-being 
and 
prosperity 
for 
all. 
The 
European 
system 
was
already 
founded; 
all 
that 
remained 
was 
to 
organize 
it.

Satisfied 
on 
these 
great 
points 
and 
with 
tranquility 
everywhere, 
I
too 
should 
have 
had 
my 
Congress 
and 
my 
Holy 
Alliance. 
Those 
ideas 
were
stolen 
from 
me. 
In 
that 
reunion 
of 
great 
sovereigns 
we 
should 
have
discussed 
our 
interests 
like 
one 
family, 
and 
have 
rendered 
account 
to
the 
peoples 
as 
clerk 
to 
master.

Europe 
would 
in 
this 
way 
soon 
have 
been,<p>
in 
fact, 
but 
one 
people, 
and
anyone 
who 
traveled 
anywhere 
would 
have 
found 
himself 
always 
in 
the
common 
fatherland. 
I 
should 
have 
demanded 
the 
freedom 
of 
all 
navigable
rivers 
for 
everybody, 
that 
the 
seas 
should 
be 
common 
to 
all, 
and 
that
the 
great 
standing 
armies 
should 
be 
reduced 
henceforth 
to 
mere 
guards
for 
the 
sovereigns.

On 
returning 
to 
France, 
to 
the 
bosom 
of 
the 
great, 
strong, 
magnificent,
peaceful, 
and 
glorious 
fatherland, 
I 
should 
have 
proclaimed
her 
frontiers 
immutable; 
all 
future 
wars 
purely 
defensive, 
all
aggrandizement 
antinational. 
I 
should 
have 
associated 
my 
son 
in 
the
Empire; 
my 
dictatorship 
would 
have 
been 
finished, 
and 
his 
constitutional
reign 
would 
have 
begun.

Paris 
would 
have 
been 
the 
capital 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UB3e1Gbiq7hBn.html">of</a> 
the 
world, 
and 
the 
French 
the 
envy
of 
the 
nations!

My 
leisure 
then, 
and 
my 
old 
age, 
would 
have 
been 
devoted, 
in 
company
with 
the 
Empress 
and 
during 
the 
royal 
apprenticeship 
of 
my 
son, 
to
leisurely 
visiting, 
with 
our 
own 
horses 
and 
like 
a 
true 
country 
couple,
every 
corner 
of 
the 
Empire, 
receiving 
complaints, 
redressing 
wrongs,
and 
scattering 
<a href="/cZl/xL4xR1JatG0HAJD.html">public</a> 
buildings<p>
and 
benefactions 
on 
all 
sides 
and
everywhere.

Napoleon, 
predestined 
by 
Providence 
for 
the 
gloomy 
role 
of 
executioner
