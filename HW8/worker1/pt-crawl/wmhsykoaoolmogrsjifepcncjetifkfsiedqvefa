her. 
When 
they
had 
last 
met 
on 
the 
old 
prince's 
name 
day, 
she 
had 
answered 
at 
random
all 
his 
attempts 
to 
talk 
sentimentally, 
evidently 
not 
listening 
to 
what
he 
was 
saying.

Julie 
on 
the 
contrary 
accepted 
his 
attentions 
readily, 
though 
in 
a
manner 
peculiar 
to 
herself.

She 
was 
twenty-seven. 
After 
the 
death 
of 
her 
brothers 
she 
had 
become
very 
wealthy. 
She 
was 
by 
now 
decidedly 
plain, 
but 
thought 
herself 
not
merely 
as 
good-looking 
as 
before 
but 
even 
far 
more 
attractive. 
She
was 
confirmed 
in 
this 
delusion 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
she 
had 
become 
a 
very
wealthy 
heiress 
and 
also 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
older 
she 
grew 
the 
less
dangerous 
she 
became 
to 
men, 
and 
the 
more 
freely 
they 
could 
associate
with 
her 
and 
avail 
themselves 
of 
her 
suppers, 
soirees, 
and 
the 
animated
company 
that 
assembled 
at 
her 
house, 
without 
incurring 
any 
obligation.
A 
man 
who 
would 
have 
been 
afraid 
ten 
years 
before 
of 
going 
every 
day
to 
the 
house 
when 
there 
was 
a 
girl 
of 
seventeen 
there, 
for 
fear 
of
compromising 
her 
and 
committing 
himself, 
would 
now 
go 
boldly 
every 
day
and 
treat 
her 
not 
as 
a 
marriageable 
girl 
but 
as 
a 
sexless 
acquaintance.

That 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/dc3UVJhk3A6.html">winter</a> 
the 
Karagins' 
house 
was 
the 
most 
agreeable 
and 
hospitable
in 
Moscow. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
formal 
evening 
and 
dinner 
parties, 
a 
large
company, 
chiefly 
of 
men, 
gathered 
there 
every 
day, 
supping 
at 
midnight
and 
staying 
till 
three 
in 
<a href="/cZl/CS38MdWa6IW.html">the</a> 
morning. 
Julie 
never 
missed 
a 
ball, 
a
promenade, 
or 
a 
play.
