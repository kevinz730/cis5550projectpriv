on 
in 
advance.

On 
the 
twenty-fourth 
the 
weather 
cleared 
up 
after 
a 
spell 
of 
rain, 
and
after 
dinner 
Pierre 
left 
Moscow. 
When 
changing 
horses 
that 
night
in 
Perkhushkovo, 
he 
learned 
that 
there 
had 
been 
a 
great 
battle 
that
evening. 
(This 
was 
the 
battle 
of 
Shevardino.) 
He 
was 
told 
that 
there 
in
Perkhushkovo 
the 
earth 
trembled 
from 
the 
firing, 
but 
nobody 
could 
answer
his 
questions 
as 
to 
who 
had 
won. 
At 
dawn 
next 
day 
Pierre 
was 
approaching
Mozhaysk.

Every 
house 
in 
Mozhaysk 
had 
soldiers 
quartered 
in 
it, 
and 
at 
the 
hostel
where 
Pierre 
was 
met 
by<p>
his 
groom 
and 
coachman 
there 
was 
no 
room 
to 
be
had. 
It 
was 
full 
of 
officers.

Everywhere 
in 
Mozhaysk 
and 
beyond 
it, 
troops 
were 
stationed 
or 
on 
the
march.<p>
Cossacks, 
foot 
and 
horse 
soldiers, 
wagons, 
caissons, 
and 
cannon
were 
everywhere. 
Pierre 
pushed 
forward 
as 
fast 
as 
he 
could, 
and 
the
farther 
he 
left 
Moscow 
behind 
and 
the 
deeper 
he 
plunged 
into 
that 
sea
of 
troops 
the 
more 
was 
he 
overcome 
by 
restless 
agitation 
and 
a 
new 
and
joyful 
feeling 
he 
had 
not 
experienced 
before. 
It 
was 
a 
feeling<p>
akin
to 
what 
he 
had 
felt 
at 
the 
Sloboda 
Palace 
during 
the 
Emperor's 
visit-a
sense 
of 
the 
necessity 
of<p>
undertaking 
something 
and 
sacrificing
something. 
He 
now 
experienced 
a 
glad 
consciousness 
that 
everything 
that
constitutes 
men's 
happiness-the 
comforts 
of 
life, 
wealth, 
even
life 
itself-is 
rubbish 
it 
is 
pleasant 
to 
throw 
away, 
compared 
with
something... 
With 
what?<p>
Pierre 
could 
not 
say, 
and 
he 
did 
not 
try 
to
determine 
for 
whom 
and 
for 
what 
he 
felt 
such 
particular 
delight 
in
sacrificing 
everything. 
He 
was 
not 
occupied 
with 
the 
question 
of 
what 
to
sacrifice 
for; 
the 
fact 
of 
sacrificing 
<a href="/cZl/YF1n5xhd4CKY.html">in</a> 
itself 
afforded 
him 
a 
new 
and
joyous 
sensation.





CHAPTER 
XIX

On 
the 
twenty-fourth 
of 
August 
the 
battle 
of 
the 
Shevardino 
Redoubt 
was
fought, 
on 
the 
twenty-fifth 
not 
a 
shot 
was 
fired 
by 
either 
side, 
and 
<a href="/cZl/Lg4mbmX92JyP.html">on
the</a> 
twenty-sixth 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino 
itself 
took 
place.

Why<p>
and 
how 
were 
the 
battles 
of 
Shevardino 
and 
Borodino 
given 
and
accepted? 
Why 
was 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino 
fought? 
There 
was 
not 
the 
least
sense 
in 
it 
for 
either 
the 
French 
or 
the 
Russians. 
Its 
immediate 
result
for 
the 
Russians 
was, 
and 
was 
bound 
to 
be, 
that 
we 
were 
brought 
nearer
to 
the 
destruction 
of 
Moscow-which 
we 
feared 
more 
than 
anything 
in
the 
world; 
and 
for 
the 
French 
its 
immediate 
result 
was 
that 
they 
were
brought 
nearer 
to 
the 
destruction 
of 
their 
whole 
army-which 
they 
feared
more 
than 
anything 
in 
the 
world. 
What 
the 
result 
must 
be 
<a href="/cZl/db9CT7KA0Nz.html">was</a> 
quite
obvious, 
and 
yet 
Napoleon 
offered 
and 
Kutuzov 
accepted 
that 
battle.

If 
the 
commanders 
had 
been 
guided 
by 
reason,<p>
it 
would 
seem 
that 
it 
must
have 
been 
obvious 
to 
Napoleon 
that 
by 
advancing 
thirteen 
hundred 
miles
and 
giving 
battle 
with 
a 
probability 
of 
losing 
a 
quarter 
of 
his 
army,
he 
was 
advancing 
to 
certain 
destruction, 
and 
it 
must 
have 
been 
equally
clear 
to 
Kutuzov 
that 
by 
accepting<p>
battle 
and<p>
risking 
the 
loss 
of 
a
quarter 
of 
his 
army 
he 
would 
certainly 
lose 
Moscow. 
For 
Kutuzov 
this 
was
mathematically 
clear, 
as 
it 
is 
that 
if 
<a href="/aVzUge/Zhu4x3pbE.html">when</a> 
playing 
draughts 
I 
have 
one
man 
less 
and 
go 
on 
exchanging, 
I 
shall 
certainly 
lose, 
and 
therefore
should 
not 
exchange. 
When 
my 
opponent 
has 
sixteen 
men 
and 
I 
have
fourteen, 
I 
am 
only 
one 
eighth 
weaker 
than 
he, 
but 
when 
I 
have 
exchanged
thirteen 
more 
men 
he 
will 
be 
three<p>
times 
as 
strong 
as 
I 
am.

Before 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino 
our 
strength 
in 
proportion<p>
to 
the 
French
was 
about 
as 
five 
to 
six, 
but 
after 
that 
battle 
it 
was 
little 
more 
than
one 
to 
two: 
previously 
we 
had 
a 
hundred 
thousand 
against 
a 
hundred 
and
twenty 
thousand; 
afterwards 
little 
more 
than 
fifty 
thousand 
against 
a
hundred 
thousand. 
Yet 
the 
shrewd 
and 
experienced 
Kutuzov 
accepted 
the
battle, 
while 
Napoleon, 
who 
was 
said 
to 
be
