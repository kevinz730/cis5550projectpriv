never 
be
anything 
wrong</h1>in 
my 
behavior. 
But 
I'll 
just 
tell 
Mamma 
how 
you 
are
behaving 
with 
Boris."

"Natalya 
Ilynichna 
behaves 
very 
well 
to 
me," 
remarked 
Boris. 
"I
have 
nothing 
to 
complain 
of."

"Don't, 
Boris! 
You 
are 
such 
a<p>
diplomat 
that 
it<p>
is 
really
tiresome," 
said 
Natasha 
in 
a 
mortified 
voice 
that 
trembled 
slightly.
(She 
used 
the 
word 
"diplomat," 
which 
was 
just 
then 
much 
in 
vogue
among 
the 
children, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Dd9XZEHJ3g8CKMN.html">in</a> 
the 
special 
sense 
they 
attached 
to 
it.) 
"Why
does 
she 
bother 
me?" 
And 
she 
added, 
turning 
to 
Vera, 
"You'll
never 
understand 
it, 
because 
you've 
never 
loved 
anyone. 
You 
have 
no
heart! 
You 
are 
a<p>
Madame 
de 
Genlis 
and 
nothing 
more" 
(this<p>
nickname,
bestowed 
on 
Vera 
by 
Nicholas, 
was 
considered 
very 
stinging), 
"and
your 
greatest 
pleasure 
is 
to 
be 
unpleasant 
to 
people! 
Go 
and 
flirt 
with
Berg 
as 
much 
as 
you 
please," 
she 
finished 
quickly.

"I 
shall 
at 
any 
rate 
not 
run 
after 
a 
young 
man 
before 
visitors..."

"Well, 
now 
you've 
done 
what 
you 
wanted," 
put 
in 
Nicholas-"said
unpleasant 
things 
to 
everyone 
and 
upset 
them. 
Let's 
go 
to 
the
nursery."

All 
four, 
like 
a 
flock 
of 
scared 
birds, 
got 
up 
and 
left 
the 
room.

"The 
unpleasant 
things 
were 
said 
to 
me," 
remarked 
Vera,<p>
"I 
said
none 
to 
anyone."

"Madame 
de 
Genlis! 
Madame 
de 
Genlis!" 
shouted 
laughing 
voices
through 
the 
door.

The 
handsome 
Vera, 
who 
produced

an 
irritating 
and

effect 
on 
everyone, 
smiled
