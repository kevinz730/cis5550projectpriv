pray 
as
Natasha 
and 
I 
used 
to 
as 
children, 
that 
the 
snow 
might 
turn 
into
sugar-and 
then 
run 
out 
into 
the 
yard 
to 
see 
whether 
it 
had 
done 
so. 
No,
but 
I 
am 
not 
praying 
for 
trifles 
now," 
he 
thought 
as 
he 
put 
his 
pipe
down 
in 
a 
corner, 
and 
folding 
his 
hands 
placed 
himself 
before 
the 
icon.
Softened 
by 
memories 
of 
Princess 
Mary 
he 
began 
to 
pray 
as 
he 
had 
not
done 
for 
a 
long 
time. 
Tears 
were 
in 
his 
eyes 
and 
in 
his 
throat 
when 
the
door 
opened 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cm8wNlRn9CpNdk5.html">Lavrushka</a> 
came 
in 
with 
some 
papers.

"Blockhead! 
Why 
do 
you 
come 
in 
without 
being 
called?" 
cried 
Nicholas,
quickly 
changing 
his 
attitude.

"From 
the 
governor," 
said 
Lavrushka 
in 
a 
sleepy 
voice. 
"A 
courier 
has
arrived 
and 
there's 
a 
letter 
for 
you."

"Well, 
all 
right, 
thanks. 
You 
can 
go!"

Nicholas 
took 
the 
two 
letters, 
one 
of 
which 
was 
from 
his 
mother 
and
the 
other 
from 
Sonya.<p>
He 
recognized 
them 
by 
the 
handwriting 
and 
opened
Sonya's<p>
first. 
He 
had 
read 
only 
a 
few<p>
lines 
when 
he 
turned 
pale 
and<p>
his
eyes 
opened 
wide 
with 
fear 
and 
joy.

"No, 
it's 
not 
possible!" 
he 
cried 
aloud.

Unable 
to 
sit 
still 
he 
paced 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room 
holding 
the 
letter 
and
reading 
it. 
He 
glanced 
<a href="/aVzUge/Oy5GCnw4J1.html">through</a> 
it, 
then 
read 
it 
again, 
and 
then 
again,
and 
standing 
still 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room 
he 
raised 
his 
shoulders,
stretching 
out 
his 
hands, 
with 
his 
mouth 
wide 
open 
and 
his 
eyes 
fixed.
What 
he 
had 
just 
been 
praying 
for 
with 
confidence 
that 
God 
would 
hear
him 
had 
come 
to 
pass; 
but 
Nicholas 
was 
as 
much 
astonished 
as 
if 
it 
were
something 
extraordinary 
and 
unexpected, 
and 
as 
if 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
it
had 
happened 
so 
quickly 
proved 
that 
it 
had 
not 
come 
from 
God 
to 
whom 
he
had 
prayed, 
but 
by 
some 
ordinary 
coincidence.

This 
unexpected 
and, 
as 
it 
seemed 
to 
Nicholas, 
quite 
voluntary 
letter
from 
Sonya 
freed 
him 
from<p>
the 
knot 
that 
fettered 
him 
and 
from 
which
there 
had 
seemed 
no 
escape. 
She 
wrote 
that 
the 
last 
unfortunate
events-the 
loss 
of 
almost 
the 
whole 
of 
the 
Rostovs' 
Moscow 
property-and
the 
countess' 
repeatedly 
expressed 
wish 
that 
Nicholas 
should 
marry
Princess 
Bolkonskaya, 
together 
with 
his 
silence 
and 
coldness 
of 
late,
had 
all 
combined 
to 
make
