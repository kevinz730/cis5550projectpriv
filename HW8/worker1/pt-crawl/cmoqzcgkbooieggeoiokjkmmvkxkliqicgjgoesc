wooded 
ravines</h1>and 
the 
copses, 
which 
at 
the 
end 
of
August 
had 
still 
been 
green 
islands 
amid 
black 
fields 
and 
stubble, 
had
become 
golden 
and 
bright-red 
islands 
amid 
the 
green 
winter 
rye. 
The
hares 
had 
already 
half 
changed 
their 
summer 
coats, 
the 
fox 
cubs 
were
beginning 
to 
scatter, 
and 
the 
young 
wolves 
were 
bigger 
than 
dogs. 
It 
was
the 
best 
time 
of 
the 
year 
for 
the 
chase. 
The 
hounds 
of 
that 
<a href="/aVzUge/hQ6STxex23.html">ardent</a> 
young
sportsman 
Rostov 
had 
not 
merely 
reached 
hard 
winter 
condition, 
but 
were
so 
jaded 
that 
at 
a 
meeting 
of 
the 
huntsmen 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
give 
them
a 
three 
days' 
rest 
and 
then, 
on 
the 
sixteenth 
of<p>
September, 
to 
go 
on
a 
distant 
expedition, 
starting 
from 
the 
oak 
grove 
where 
there 
was 
an
undisturbed 
litter 
of 
wolf 
cubs.

All 
that 
day 
the 
hounds 
remained 
at 
home. 
It 
was 
frosty 
and 
the 
air 
was
sharp, 
but 
toward 
evening 
the 
sky 
became 
overcast 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cm8wNlRn9CpNdk5.html">and</a> 
it 
began 
to 
thaw.
On 
the 
fifteenth, 
when 
young 
Rostov, 
in 
his 
dressing 
gown, 
looked 
out
of 
the 
window, 
he 
saw 
it 
was 
an 
unsurpassable 
morning 
for 
hunting: 
it
was 
as 
if 
the 
sky 
were 
melting 
and 
sinking 
to 
the 
earth 
without 
any
wind. 
The 
only 
motion 
in 
the 
air 
was 
that 
of 
the 
dripping, 
microscopic
particles 
of 
drizzling 
mist. 
The 
bare 
twigs 
in 
the 
garden 
were 
hung 
with
transparent 
drops 
which 
fell 
on 
the 
freshly 
fallen 
leaves. 
The 
earth 
in
the 
kitchen 
garden 
looked 
wet 
and 
black 
and 
glistened 
like 
poppy 
seed
and 
at 
a 
short 
distance 
merged 
into 
the 
dull, 
moist 
veil 
of 
mist.
Nicholas 
went 
out 
into 
the 
wet 
and 
muddy 
porch. 
There 
was 
a 
smell 
of
decaying 
leaves 
and 
of 
dog. 
Milka, 
a 
black-spotted, 
broad-haunched
bitch 
with 
prominent 
black 
eyes, 
got 
up 
on 
seeing 
her 
master, 
stretched
her 
hind 
legs, 
lay 
down 
like 
a 
hare, 
and 
then 
suddenly 
jumped 
up 
and
licked 
him 
right 
on 
his 
nose 
and 
mustache. 
Another 
borzoi, 
a 
dog,
catching 
sight 
of 
his 
master 
from 
the 
garden 
path, 
arched 
his 
back
and, 
rushing 
headlong 
toward 
the 
porch 
with 
lifted 
tail, 
began 
rubbing
himself 
against 
his 
legs.

"O-hoy!" 
came 
at 
that 
moment, 
that 
inimitable 
huntsman's 
call
which 
unites 
the 
deepest 
bass 
with 
the 
shrillest 
tenor, 
and 
round
the 
corner 
came 
Daniel 
the 
head 
huntsman 
and 
head 
kennelman, 
a 
gray,
wrinkled 
old 
man 
with 
hair 
cut 
straight 
over 
his 
forehead, 
Ukrainian
fashion, 
a 
long 
bent 
whip 
in 
his 
hand, 
and 
that 
look 
of 
independence
and 
scorn 
of 
everything 
that 
is 
only 
seen 
in 
huntsmen. 
He 
doffed 
his
Circassian 
cap 
to 
his 
master 
and 
looked 
at 
him 
scornfully. 
This 
scorn
was
