impossible.

It 
was<p>
impossible 
first 
because-as 
experience 
shows 
that 
a 
three-mile
movement 
of 
columns 
on 
a 
battlefield 
never 
coincides 
with 
the 
plans-the
probability 
of 
Chichagov, 
Kutuzov, 
and 
Wittgenstein 
effecting 
a 
junction
on 
time 
at 
an 
appointed 
place 
was 
so 
remote 
as 
to 
be 
tantamount 
to
impossibility, 
as 
in 
fact 
thought 
Kutuzov, 
who 
when 
he 
received 
the 
plan
remarked 
that 
diversions 
planned 
over 
great 
distances 
do 
not 
<a href="/cZl/qK5mM4pXQvm.html">yield</a> 
the
desired 
results.

Secondly 
it 
was 
impossible, 
because 
to 
paralyze 
the 
momentum 
with 
which
Napoleon's 
army 
was 
retiring, 
incomparably 
greater 
forces 
than 
the
Russians 
possessed 
would 
have 
been 
required.

Thirdly 
it 
was 
impossible, 
because 
the 
military 
term 
"to 
cut 
off" 
has 
no
meaning. 
One 
can 
cut 
off 
a 
slice 
of 
bread, 
but 
not 
an 
army. 
To 
cut 
off
an 
army-to 
bar 
its 
road-is 
quite 
impossible, 
for 
there 
is 
always 
plenty
of 
room 
to 
avoid 
capture 
and 
there 
is 
the 
night 
when 
nothing 
can 
be
seen, 
as 
the 
military 
scientists 
might 
convince 
themselves 
by 
the
example 
of 
Krasnoe 
and 
of 
the 
Berezina. 
It 
is 
only 
possible 
to 
capture
prisoners 
if 
they 
agree 
to 
be 
captured, 
just 
as 
it 
is 
only 
possible
to 
catch 
a 
swallow 
if 
it 
settles 
on 
one's 
hand. 
Men 
can 
only 
be 
taken
prisoners 
if 
they 
surrender 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
strategy 
and
tactics, 
as 
the 
Germans 
did. 
But 
the 
French 
troops 
quite 
rightly 
did 
not
consider 
that 
this 
suited 
them, 
since 
death 
by 
hunger 
and 
cold 
awaited
them 
in 
flight 
or 
captivity 
alike.

Fourthly 
and 
chiefly 
it 
was 
impossible, 
because 
never 
since 
the 
world
began 
has 
a 
war 
been 
fought 
under 
such 
conditions 
as 
those 
that 
obtained
in 
1812, 
and 
the 
Russian 
army 
in 
its 
pursuit 
of 
the 
French 
strained 
its
strength 
to 
the 
utmost 
and 
could 
not 
have 
done 
more 
without 
destroying
itself.

During 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
Russian 
army 
from 
Tarutino 
to 
Krasnoe 
it
lost 
fifty 
thousand 
sick 
or 
stragglers, 
that 
is 
a 
number 
equal 
to<p>
the
population 
of 
a 
large 
provincial 
town. 
Half 
the 
men 
fell 
out 
of 
the 
army
without 
a 
battle.

And 
it 
is 
of 
this 
period 
of 
the 
campaign-when 
the 
army 
lacked 
boots
and 
sheepskin 
coats, 
was 
short 
of 
provisions 
and 
without 
vodka, 
and
was 
camping 
out 
at 
night 
for 
months 
in 
the 
snow 
with 
fifteen 
degrees
of 
frost, 
when 
there 
were 
only 
seven 
or 
eight 
hours 
of 
daylight 
and
the 
rest 
was 
night 
in 
which 
the 
influence 
of 
discipline 
cannot 
be
maintained, 
when 
men 
were 
taken 
into 
that 
region 
of 
death 
where
discipline 
fails, 
not 
for<p>
a 
few 
hours 
only 
as 
in 
a 
battle, 
but 
for
months, 
where 
they 
were 
every 
moment 
fighting 
death 
from 
hunger 
and
cold, 
when 
half 
the 
army 
perished 
in 
a 
single 
month-it 
is 
of 
this<p>
period
of 
the 
campaign 
that 
the 
historians 
tell 
us 
how 
Miloradovich 
should 
have
made 
a 
flank 
march 
to 
such 
and 
such 
a 
place, 
Tormasov 
to 
another 
place,
and 
Chichagov 
should 
have 
crossed 
(more 
than 
knee-deep 
in 
snow) 
to
somewhere 
else, 
and 
how 
so-and-so 
"routed" 
and 
"cut 
off" 
the 
French 
and
so 
on 
and 
so 
on.

The 
Russians, 
half 
of 
whom 
died, 
did 
all 
that 
could
