realm; 
to 
another 
it 
is 
liberty, 
equality,
and 
a 
certain 
kind 
of 
civilization 
of 
a 
small 
corner 
of 
the 
world 
called
Europe.

In 
1789 
a 
ferment 
arises 
in 
Paris; 
it 
grows, 
spreads, 
and 
is 
expressed
by 
a 
movement 
of 
peoples<p>
from 
west 
to 
east. 
Several 
times<p>
it 
moves
eastward 
and 
collides 
with 
a 
countermovement 
from 
the 
east 
westward.
In 
1812 
it 
reaches 
its 
extreme 
limit, 
Moscow, 
and 
then, 
with 
remarkable
symmetry, 
a 
countermovement 
occurs 
from 
east 
to 
west, 
attracting 
to
it, 
as 
the 
first 
movement 
had 
done, 
the 
nations 
of 
middle 
Europe. 
The
counter 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tv8YXnB9gle4CMvYt.html">movement</a> 
reaches 
the 
starting 
point 
of 
the 
first 
movement 
in 
the
west-Paris-and 
subsides.

During 
that 
twenty-year 
period 
an 
immense 
number 
of 
fields 
<a href="/cZl/PK8tHLaX8sfA3mTUVM.html">were</a> 
left
untilled, 
houses 
were 
burned, 
trade 
changed 
its 
direction, 
millions
of 
men 
migrated, 
were 
impoverished, 
or<p>
were 
enriched, 
and 
millions
of 
Christian 
men 
professing 
the 
law 
of 
love 
of 
their 
fellows 
slew 
one
another.

What 
does 
all 
this 
mean? 
Why 
did 
it 
happen? 
What 
made 
those 
people 
burn
houses 
and 
slay<p>
their 
fellow 
men? 
What 
were 
the 
causes 
of 
these 
events?
What 
force 
made 
men 
act 
so? 
These 
are 
the 
instinctive, 
plain, 
and
most 
legitimate 
questions 
humanity 
asks 
itself 
<a href="/aVzUge/Eq19BwgT0.html">when</a> 
it 
encounters 
the
monuments 
and 
tradition 
of 
that 
period.

For 
a 
reply 
to 
these 
questions 
the 
common 
sense 
of 
mankind 
turns 
to 
the
science 
of 
history, 
whose 
aim 
is 
to 
enable 
nations 
and 
humanity 
to 
know
themselves.

If 
history 
had 
retained 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
ancients 
it 
would 
have
said 
that 
God, 
to 
reward 
or 
punish 
his 
people, 
gave 
Napoleon 
power 
and
directed 
his 
will 
to 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
the 
divine 
ends, 
and 
that 
reply
would 
have 
been 
clear 
and 
complete. 
One 
might 
believe 
or 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ro24om6yYzh.html">disbelieve
in</a> 
the 
divine 
significance 
of 
Napoleon, 
but 
for 
anyone 
believing 
in
it 
there 
would 
have 
been 
nothing 
unintelligible 
in 
the 
history 
of 
that
period, 
nor 
would 
there 
have 
been 
any 
contradictions.

But 
modern 
history 
cannot 
give 
that 
reply. 
Science 
does 
not 
admit 
the
conception 
of 
the 
ancients 
as 
to 
the 
direct 
participation 
of 
the 
Deity
in 
human 
affairs, 
and 
therefore 
history 
ought 
to 
give 
other 
answers.

Modern 
history 
replying 
to 
these 
questions 
says: 
you 
want 
to 
know 
what
this 
movement 
means, 
what 
caused 
it, 
and 
what 
force 
produced 
these
events? 
Then 
listen:

"Louis 
XIV 
<a href="/cZl/mV9Ook9.html">was</a> 
a 
very 
proud 
and 
self-confident 
man; 
he 
had 
such 
and 
such
mistresses 
and 
such 
and 
such 
ministers 
and 
he 
ruled 
France 
badly.
