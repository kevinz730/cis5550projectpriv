service 
for 
the 
twentieth 
time</h1>that 
day, 
began 
lazily 
and
mechanically 
to 
sing: 
"Save 
from 
calamity 
Thy 
servants, 
O 
Mother 
of
God," 
and 
the 
priest 
and 
deacon 
chimed 
in: 
"For 
to 
Thee 
under 
God 
we 
all
flee 
as 
to 
an 
inviolable 
bulwark 
and 
protection," 
there 
again 
kindled 
<a href="/">in
all</a> 
those 
faces 
the 
same 
expression 
of 
consciousness 
of 
the 
solemnity
of 
the 
impending 
moment 
that 
Pierre 
had 
seen 
on<p>
the 
faces 
at 
the 
foot 
of
the 
hill 
at 
Mozhaysk 
and 
momentarily 
on 
many 
and 
many 
faces 
he 
had 
met
that 
morning; 
and 
heads 
were 
bowed 
more 
frequently 
and 
hair 
tossed 
back,
and 
sighs 
and 
the 
sound 
men 
made 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Hi3AF3G4KqZP.html">as</a> 
they 
crossed 
themselves 
were 
heard.

The 
crowd 
round 
the 
icon 
suddenly 
parted 
and 
pressed 
against 
Pierre.
Someone, 
a 
very 
important 
personage 
judging 
by 
the 
haste 
with 
which 
way
was 
made 
for 
him, 
was 
approaching 
the 
icon.

It 
was 
Kutuzov, 
who 
had 
been 
riding 
round 
the 
position 
and 
on 
his 
way
back 
to 
Tatarinova 
had 
stopped 
where 
the 
service 
was 
being 
held. 
Pierre
recognized 
him 
at 
once 
by 
his 
peculiar 
figure, 
which 
distinguished 
him
from 
everybody 
else.

With 
a 
long 
overcoat 
on 
his 
exceedingly 
stout, 
round-shouldered 
body,
with 
uncovered 
white 
head 
and 
puffy 
face 
showing 
the 
white 
ball 
of 
the
eye 
he 
had 
lost,<p>
Kutuzov 
walked 
with 
plunging, 
swaying 
gait 
into
the 
crowd 
and 
stopped 
behind 
the 
priest. 
He 
crossed 
himself 
with 
an
accustomed 
movement, 
bent 
till 
he 
touched 
the 
ground 
with 
his 
hand, 
and
bowed 
his 
white 
head 
with 
a 
deep 
sigh. 
Behind 
Kutuzov 
was 
Bennigsen 
and
the 
suite. 
Despite 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
commander 
in 
chief, 
who 
attracted
the 
attention 
of 
all 
the 
superior 
officers, 
the 
militiamen 
and 
soldiers
continued 
their 
prayers 
without 
looking 
at 
him.

When 
the 
service 
was 
over, 
Kutuzov 
stepped 
up 
to 
the 
icon, 
sank 
heavily
to 
his 
knees, 
bowed 
to 
the 
ground, 
and 
for 
a 
long 
time 
tried 
vainly 
to
rise, 
but 
could 
not 
do 
so 
on 
account 
of 
his 
weakness 
and 
weight. 
His
white 
head 
twitched
