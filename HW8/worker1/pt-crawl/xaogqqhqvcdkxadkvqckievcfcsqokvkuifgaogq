Count 
Kamensky's</h1>campaign, 
the 
old 
prince
began 
unexpectedly 
to 
talk 
about 
Princess 
Mary, 
blaming 
her 
for 
her
superstitions 
and 
her 
dislike 
of 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
who, 
he 
said,
was 
the 
only 
person 
really 
attached 
to 
him.

The 
old 
prince 
said 
that 
if 
he 
was 
ill 
it 
was 
only 
because<p>
of 
Princess
Mary: 
that 
she 
purposely 
worried 
and 
irritated 
him, 
and 
that 
by
indulgence 
and 
silly 
talk 
she 
was 
spoiling 
little 
Prince 
Nicholas. 
The
old 
prince 
knew 
very 
well 
that 
he 
tormented 
his 
daughter 
and 
that 
her
life 
was 
very 
hard, 
but 
he 
also 
knew 
that 
he 
could 
not 
help 
tormenting
her 
and 
that 
she 
deserved 
it. 
"Why 
does 
Prince 
Andrew, 
who 
sees 
this,
say 
nothing 
to 
me 
about 
his 
sister? 
Does 
he 
think 
me 
a 
scoundrel, 
or 
an
old 
fool 
who, 
without 
any 
reason, 
keeps 
his 
own 
daughter 
at 
a 
distance
and 
attaches 
this 
Frenchwoman 
to 
himself? 
He 
doesn't 
understand, 
so 
I
must 
explain 
it, 
and 
he 
must 
hear 
me 
out," 
thought 
the 
old 
prince.
And 
he 
began 
explaining 
why 
he 
could 
not 
put 
up 
with 
his 
daughter's
unreasonable 
character.

"If 
you 
ask 
me," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
without 
looking 
up 
(he 
was
censuring 
his 
father 
for 
the 
first 
time 
in 
his 
life), 
"I 
did 
not 
wish 
to
speak 
about 
it, 
but 
as 
you 
ask 
me 
I 
will 
give 
you 
my 
frank 
opinion. 
If
there 
is 
any 
misunderstanding 
and 
<a href="/cZl/oz7EXJo37NPT.html">discord</a> 
between 
you 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/gl6U83vGF.html">and</a> 
Mary, 
I 
can't
blame 
her 
for 
it 
at 
all. 
I 
know 
how 
she 
loves 
and 
respects 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/iw5i9vWPe0KqZP.html">you.</a> 
Since
you 
ask 
me," 
continued 
Prince 
Andrew, 
becoming 
irritable-as<p>
he 
was
always 
liable 
to 
do 
of 
late-"I 
can 
only 
say 
that 
if 
there 
are 
any
misunderstandings 
they 
are 
caused 
by 
that 
worthless 
woman, 
who 
is 
not
fit 
to 
be 
my 
sister's 
companion."

The 
old 
man 
at 
first 
stared 
fixedly 
at 
his 
son, 
and<p>
an 
unnatural 
smile
disclosed 
the 
fresh 
gap 
between 
his 
teeth 
to 
which 
Prince 
Andrew 
could
not 
get 
accustomed.

"What 
companion, 
my 
dear 
boy? 
Eh? 
You've 
already 
been 
talking 
it 
over!
Eh?"

"Father, 
I 
did 
not 
want 
to 
judge," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
in 
a 
hard 
and
bitter 
tone, 
"but<p>
you 
challenged 
me,<p>
and 
I 
have 
said, 
and 
always 
shall
say, 
that 
Mary<p>
is 
not 
to 
blame, 
but 
those 
to 
blame-the 
one 
to 
blame-is
that 
Frenchwoman."

"Ah, 
he 
has 
passed 
judgment... 
passed 
judgement!" 
said 
the 
old 
man 
in 
a
low 
voice 
and, 
as 
it 
seemed 
to 
Prince 
Andrew, 
with 
some 
embarrassment,
but 
then 
he 
suddenly 
jumped 
up 
and 
cried: 
"Be 
off, 
be 
off! 
Let 
not 
a
trace 
of 
you 
remain
