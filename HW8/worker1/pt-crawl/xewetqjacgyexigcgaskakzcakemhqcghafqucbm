from 
the 
shirt.

"Gone 
to 
bed?" 
asked 
the 
prince.

Tikhon, 
like 
all 
good 
valets, 
instinctively 
knew 
the 
direction 
of 
his
master's 
thoughts. 
He 
guessed 
that 
the 
question 
referred 
to 
Prince
Vasili 
and 
his 
son.

"They 
have 
gone 
to 
bed 
and 
put 
out 
their 
lights, 
your 
excellency."

"No 
good... 
no 
good..." 
said 
the 
prince 
rapidly, 
and 
thrusting 
his
feet 
into 
his 
slippers 
and 
his 
arms 
into 
the 
sleeves 
of 
his 
dressing
gown, 
he 
went 
to 
the 
couch 
on 
which 
he 
slept.

Though 
no 
words 
had 
passed 
between 
Anatole 
and 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne,
they 
quite 
understood 
one 
<a href="/cZl/iP4INZ3gK6BwgT.html">another</a> 
as 
to 
the 
first 
part 
of 
their 
romance,
up 
to 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
pauvre 
mere; 
they 
understood 
that 
they 
had
much 
to 
say 
to 
one 
another 
in 
private 
and 
so 
they 
had 
been 
seeking 
an
opportunity 
since 
morning 
to 
meet 
one 
another 
alone. 
When 
Princess 
Mary
went 
to 
her 
father's<p>
room 
at 
the 
usual 
hour, 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne
and 
Anatole 
met 
in 
the 
conservatory.

Princess 
Mary 
went 
to 
the 
door 
of 
the 
study 
with 
special 
trepidation.
It 
seemed 
to 
her 
that 
not 
only 
did 
everybody 
know 
that 
her 
fate 
would 
be
decided 
that 
day, 
but 
that 
they 
also 
knew 
what 
she 
thought 
about 
it. 
She
read 
this 
in 
Tikhon's 
face 
and 
in 
that 
of 
Prince 
Vasili's 
valet,
who 
made 
her 
a 
low 
bow 
when 
she<p>
met 
him 
in 
the 
corridor 
carrying 
hot
water.

The 
old 
prince 
was 
very 
affectionate 
and 
careful 
in 
his 
treatment 
of
his 
daughter 
that 
morning. 
Princess 
Mary 
well 
knew<p>
this 
painstaking
expression 
of 
her 
father's. 
His 
face 
wore 
that 
expression 
when 
his
dry 
hands 
clenched 
with 
vexation 
at 
her 
not 
understanding 
a 
sum 
in
arithmetic, 
when 
rising 
from 
his 
chair 
he 
would 
walk 
away 
from 
her,
repeating 
in 
a 
low 
voice 
the 
same 
words 
several 
times 
over.

He 
came 
to 
the 
point 
at 
once, 
treating 
her 
ceremoniously.

"I 
have 
had 
a 
proposition 
made 
me 
concerning 
you," 
he 
said 
with 
an
unnatural 
smile. 
"I 
expect 
you 
have 
guessed 
that 
Prince 
Vasili 
has
not 
come 
and 
brought 
his 
pupil 
with 
him" 
(for 
some 
reason 
Prince
Bolkonski<p>
referred 
to 
Anatole 
as 
a 
"pupil") 
"for 
the 
sake 
of 
my
beautiful 
eyes. 
Last 
night 
a 
proposition 
was 
made<p>
me 
on 
your 
account
and, 
as 
you 
know 
my 
principles, 
I 
refer 
it 
to 
you."

"How 
am 
I 
to 
understand 
you, 
mon 
pere?" 
said 
the 
princess, 
growing
pale 
and 
then 
blushing.

"How 
understand 
me!" 
cried 
her 
father 
angrily. 
"Prince 
Vasili
finds 
you 
to 
his 
taste 
as 
a 
daughter-in-law 
and 
makes 
a 
proposal 
to 
you
on 
his 
pupil's 
behalf. 
That's 
how 
it's 
to 
be 
understood! 
'How
understand 
it'!... 
And 
I 
ask 
you!"

"I 
do 
not 
know 
what 
you 
think, 
Father," 
whispered 
the 
princess.

"I? 
I? 
What 
of 
me? 
Leave 
me 
out 
of 
the 
question. 
I'm 
not 
going 
to
get 
married. 
What 
about 
you? 
That's 
what 
I 
want 
to<p>
know."

The 
princess 
saw 
that 
her 
father 
regarded 
the 
matter 
with 
disapproval,
but 
at 
that 
moment 
the 
thought 
occurred 
to 
her 
that 
her 
fate 
would 
be
decided 
now 
or 
never. 
She 
lowered 
her 
eyes 
so 
as 
not 
to 
see 
the 
gaze
under 
which 
she 
felt 
that 
she 
could 
not 
think, 
but 
would 
only 
be 
able 
to
submit 
from 
habit, 
and 
she 
said: 
"I 
wish 
only 
to 
do 
your 
will, 
but 
if
I 
had 
to 
express 
my 
own 
desire..." 
She 
had 
no 
time 
to 
finish. 
The 
old
prince 
interrupted 
her.

"That's 
admirable!" 
he 
shouted. 
"He 
will 
<a href="/cZl/jf4H02Npkec.html">take</a> 
you 
with 
your
dowry<p>
and 
take 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
into 
the 
bargain. 
She'll 
be 
the
wife, 
while 
you..."

The 
prince 
stopped. 
He 
saw 
the 
effect 
these 
words 
had 
produced 
on 
his
daughter. 
She 
lowered 
her 
head 
and 
was 
ready 
to 
burst 
into 
tears.

"Now 
then, 
now 
then, 
I'm 
only 
joking!" 
he 
said. 
"Remember 
this,
Princess, 
I 
hold 
to 
the 
principle 
that 
a 
maiden 
has 
a 
full 
right 
to
choose. 
I 
give 
you 
freedom. 
Only 
remember 
that
