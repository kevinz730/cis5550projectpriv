loves 
me 
so!" 
said</h1>Helene, 
who 
for 
some 
reason 
imagined 
that
Pierre 
too 
loved 
her. 
"He 
will 
do 
anything 
for 
me."

Bilibin 
puckered 
his 
skin 
in 
preparation 
for 
something 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NXJ5AHAK.html">witty.

"Even</a> 
divorce 
you?" 
said 
he.

Helene 
laughed.

Among 
those 
who 
ventured 
to 
doubt 
the 
justifiability 
of 
the 
proposed
marriage 
was 
Helene's 
mother, 
Princess 
Kuragina. 
She 
was 
continually
tormented 
by 
jealousy 
of 
her 
daughter, 
and 
now 
that 
jealousy 
concerned
a 
subject 
near 
to 
her 
own 
heart, 
she 
could 
not 
reconcile 
herself 
to 
the
idea. 
She 
consulted 
a 
Russian 
priest 
as 
to 
the 
possibility 
of 
divorce
and 
remarriage 
during 
a 
husband's 
lifetime, 
and 
the 
priest 
told 
her 
that
it 
was 
impossible, 
and 
to 
her 
delight 
showed 
her 
a 
text 
in 
the 
Gospel
which 
(as 
it 
seemed 
to 
him) 
plainly 
forbids 
remarriage 
while 
the 
husband
is 
alive.

Armed 
with 
these 
arguments, 
which 
appeared 
to 
her 
unanswerable, 
she
drove 
to 
her 
daughter's 
early<p>
one 
morning 
so 
as 
to 
find 
her 
alone.

Having 
listened 
to 
her 
mother's 
objections, 
Helene 
smiled 
blandly 
and
ironically.

"But 
it 
says 
plainly: 
'Whosoever 
shall 
marry 
her 
that 
is 
divorced...'"
said 
the 
old 
princess.

"Ah, 
Maman, 
ne 
dites 
pas 
de 
betises. 
Vous 
ne 
comprenez 
rien. 
Dans 
ma
position 
j'ai 
des 
devoirs," 
* 
said 
Helene 
changing 
from 
Russian, 
in
which 
language 
she 
always 
felt 
that 
her 
case 
did 
not 
sound 
quite 
clear,
into 
French 
which 
suited 
it 
better.

 
 
 
 
 
* 
"Oh, 
Mamma, 
don't 
talk 
nonsense! 
You 
don't 
understand
 
 
 
 
 
anything. 
In 
my 
position 
I 
have 
obligations."


"But, 
my 
dear...."

"Oh, 
Mamma, 
how 
is 
it 
you 
don't 
understand 
that 
the 
Holy 
Father, 
who 
has
the 
right 
to 
grant 
dispensations..."

Just 
then 
the 
lady 
companion 
who 
lived 
with 
Helene 
came 
in 
to 
announce
that 
His 
Highness 
was 
in 
the 
ballroom 
and 
wished 
to 
see 
her.

"Non, 
dites-lui 
que 
je 
ne 
veux 
pas 
le 
voir, 
que 
je 
suis 
furieuse 
contre
lui, 
parce 
qu'il 
m'a 
manque 
parole." 
*

 
 
 
 
 
* 
"No, 
tell 
him 
I 
don't 
<a href="/cZl/xL4xR1JatG0HAJD.html">wish</a> 
to 
see 
him, 
I 
am 
furious 
with
 
 
 
 
 
him 
for 
not 
keeping 
his 
word 
to 
me."


"Comtesse, 
a 
tout 
peche 
misericorde," 
* 
said 
a 
fair-haired 
young 
man
with 
a 
long 
face 
and 
nose, 
as 
he 
entered 
the 
room.

 
 
 
 
* 
"Countess, 
there 
is 
mercy 
for 
every 
sin."


The 
old 
princess 
rose 
respectfully 
and 
curtsied. 
The 
young 
man 
who<p>
had
entered<p>
took 
no 
notice 
of 
her. 
The 
princess 
nodded 
to 
her 
daughter 
and
sidled 
out 
of 
the 
room.

"Yes, 
she 
is 
right," 
thought 
the 
old 
princess, 
all 
her 
convictions
dissipated 
by 
the 
appearance 
of 
His 
Highness. 
"She 
is 
right, 
but 
how
is 
it 
that 
we 
in 
our 
irrecoverable 
youth 
did 
not 
know 
it? 
Yet 
it 
is 
so
simple," 
she 
thought 
as 
she 
got<p>
into 
her 
carriage.


By 
the<p>
beginning 
of 
August 
Helene's 
affairs 
were 
clearly 
defined 
and
she 
wrote 
a 
letter 
to 
her 
husband-who, 
as 
she 
imagined, 
loved 
her 
very
much-informing 
him 
of 
her 
intention 
<a href="/cZl/qv22GLY3BAcC.html">to</a> 
marry 
N.N. 
and 
of 
her 
having
embraced 
the 
one 
true 
faith, 
and 
asking 
him 
to 
carry 
out 
all 
the
formalities 
necessary 
for 
a 
divorce, 
which 
would 
be 
explained 
to 
him 
by
the 
bearer 
of 
the 
letter.

And 
so 
I 
pray 
God 
to 
have 
you, 
my 
friend, 
in 
His 
holy 
and 
powerful
keeping-Your 
friend 
Helene.

This 
letter 
was 
brought 
to 
Pierre's 
house 
when 
he 
was 
on 
the 
field 
of
Borodino.
