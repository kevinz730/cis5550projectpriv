or 
Pfuel's 
plan</h1>of 
campaign. 
In 
answer
to 
Toll, 
Paulucci 
suggested 
an 
advance 
and 
an 
attack, 
which, 
he 
urged,
could 
alone 
extricate 
us 
from 
the 
present 
uncertainty 
and 
from 
the 
trap
(as 
he 
called 
the 
Drissa<p>
camp) 
in 
which 
we 
were 
situated.

During 
all 
these 
discussions 
Pfuel 
and 
his 
interpreter, 
Wolzogen
(his 
"bridge" 
in 
court 
relations), 
were 
silent. 
Pfuel 
only<p>
snorted
contemptuously 
and 
turned 
away, 
to 
show 
that 
he 
would 
never 
demean
himself 
by 
replying 
to 
such 
nonsense 
as 
he 
was 
now 
hearing. 
So 
when
Prince 
Volkonski, 
who 
was 
in 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/fU9i8v2i.html">chair,</a> 
called 
on 
him 
to 
give 
his
opinion, 
he 
merely 
said:

"Why 
ask 
me? 
General 
Armfeldt 
has 
proposed 
a 
splendid 
position 
with 
an
exposed 
rear, 
or 
why 
not 
this 
Italian 
gentleman's 
attack-very 
fine, 
or
a 
retreat, 
also 
good! 
Why 
ask 
me?" 
said 
he. 
"Why, 
you 
yourselves 
know
everything 
better 
than 
I 
do."

But 
when 
Volkonski 
said, 
with 
a 
frown, 
<a href="/aVzUge/Hqk4G5DduKC9ven.html">that</a> 
it 
was 
in 
the<p>
Emperor's 
name
that 
he 
asked 
his 
opinion, 
Pfuel 
rose 
and, 
suddenly 
growing 
animated,
began 
to 
speak:

"Everything 
has 
been 
spoiled, 
everything 
muddled, 
everybody 
thought 
they
knew 
better 
than 
I 
did, 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/AR4X6NbF4dG.html">now</a> 
you 
come 
to 
me! 
How 
mend 
matters? 
There
is 
nothing 
to 
mend! 
The 
principles 
laid 
down 
by 
me 
must 
be 
strictly
adhered 
to," 
said 
he, 
drumming 
on 
the 
table 
with 
his 
bony 
fingers. 
"What
is 
the 
difficulty? 
Nonsense, 
childishness!"

He 
went 
up 
to 
the 
map 
and
