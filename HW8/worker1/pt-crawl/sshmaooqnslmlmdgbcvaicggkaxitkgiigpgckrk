commands, 
were 
related 
to</h1>events, 
historians 
have 
assumed
that 
the 
events 
depended 
on 
those 
commands. 
But 
examining 
the 
events
themselves 
and 
the 
connection 
in 
which 
the 
historical 
persons 
stood 
to
the 
people, 
we 
have 
found 
that 
they<p>
and 
their 
orders 
were 
dependent 
on
events. 
The 
incontestable 
proof 
of 
this 
deduction 
is 
that, 
however 
many
commands 
were 
issued, 
the 
event 
does<p>
not 
take 
place 
unless 
there 
are
other 
causes 
for 
it, 
but 
as 
soon 
as 
an 
event 
occurs-be 
it 
what 
it
may-then 
out 
of 
all 
the 
continually 
expressed 
wishes 
of 
different 
people
some 
will 
always 
be 
found 
which 
by 
their 
meaning 
and 
their 
time 
of
utterance 
are 
related 
as 
commands 
to 
the 
events.

Arriving 
at 
this 
conclusion 
we 
can 
reply 
directly 
and 
positively 
to
these 
two 
essential 
questions 
of 
history:

(1) 
What 
is 
power?

(2) 
What 
force 
produces 
the 
movement 
of 
the<p>
nations?

(1) 
Power 
is 
the 
relation 
of 
a 
given 
person 
to 
other 
individuals,
in 
which 
the 
more 
this 
person 
expresses 
opinions, 
predictions, 
and
justifications 
of 
the 
collective 
action 
that 
is 
performed, 
the 
less 
is
his 
participation 
in 
that 
action.

(2) 
The 
movement 
of 
nations 
is 
caused 
not 
by 
power, 
nor 
by 
intellectual
activity, 
nor<p>
even 
by 
a 
combination 
of 
the 
two 
as 
historians 
have
supposed, 
but 
by 
the 
activity 
of 
all 
the 
people 
who 
participate 
in
the 
events, 
and 
who 
always 
combine 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
those 
taking
the 
largest 
direct 
share 
in 
the 
event 
take 
on 
themselves 
the 
least
responsibility 
and 
vice 
versa.

Morally 
the 
wielder 
of 
power 
appears 
to 
cause 
the 
event; 
physically
it 
is 
those 
who 
submit 
to 
the 
power. 
But 
as 
the 
moral 
activity 
is
inconceivable 
without 
the 
physical, 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
event 
is 
neither 
in
the 
one 
nor 
in 
the 
other 
but 
in 
the 
union 
of 
the 
two.

Or 
in 
other 
words, 
the 
conception 
of 
a 
cause 
is 
inapplicable 
to 
the
phenomena 
we 
are 
examining.

In 
the 
last 
analysis 
<a href="/cZl/dG51mk.html">we</a> 
reach 
the 
circle 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EJ4KpkPN7d0P.html">infinity-that</a> 
final 
limit
to 
which 
in 
every 
domain 
of 
thought 
man's 
reason 
arrives 
if 
it 
is
