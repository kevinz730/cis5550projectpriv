were
unshakable. 
We 
pass 
the</h1>time 
as 
we 
can, 
but 
in 
war 
as 
in 
war! 
The
princesses 
Aline 
and 
Sophie 
sit 
whole 
days 
with 
me, 
and 
we, 
unhappy
widows 
of 
live 
men, 
make 
beautiful 
conversations 
over 
our 
charpie, 
only
you, 
my 
friend, 
are 
missing..." 
and 
so 
on.

The 
chief 
reason 
Princess 
Mary 
did 
not 
realize 
the 
full 
significance 
of
this 
war 
was 
that 
the 
old 
prince 
never 
spoke 
of 
it, 
did 
not 
recognize
it, 
and 
laughed 
at 
Dessalles 
when 
he 
mentioned 
it 
at 
dinner.
The 
prince's 
tone 
was 
so 
calm 
and 
confident 
that 
Princess 
Mary
unhesitatingly 
believed 
him.

All 
that 
July 
the 
old 
prince 
was 
exceedingly 
active 
and 
even 
animated.
He 
planned 
another 
garden 
and 
began 
a 
new 
building 
for 
the 
domestic
serfs. 
The 
only 
thing 
that 
made 
Princess 
Mary 
anxious 
about 
him 
was 
that
he 
slept 
very 
little 
and, 
instead 
of 
sleeping 
in 
his 
study 
as 
usual,
changed 
his 
sleeping 
place 
every 
day. 
One 
day 
he 
would 
order 
his 
camp
bed 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/FW2mbEd87g.html">to</a> 
be 
set 
up 
in 
the 
glass 
gallery, 
another 
day 
he 
remained 
on 
the
couch 
or 
on 
the 
lounge 
chair 
in 
the 
drawing 
room 
and 
dozed 
there 
without
undressing,
