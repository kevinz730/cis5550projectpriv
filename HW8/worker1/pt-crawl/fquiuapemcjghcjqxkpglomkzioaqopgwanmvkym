friendly 
advice, 
mon 
cher.</h1>Be 
off 
as 
soon 
as 
you 
can, 
that's
all 
I 
have 
to 
tell<p>
you. 
Happy 
he 
who 
has 
ears 
<a href="/aVzUge/OH80CyE7uR.html">to</a> 
hear. 
Good-by, 
my 
dear
fellow. 
Oh, 
by 
the 
by!" 
he 
shouted 
through 
the 
doorway 
after 
Pierre,
"is 
it 
true 
that 
the 
countess 
has 
fallen 
into 
the 
clutches 
of 
the<p>
holy
fathers 
of 
the 
Society 
of 
Jesus?"

Pierre 
did 
not 
answer 
and

Rostopchin's 
room 
more 
sullen 
and 
angry
than 
he 
had 
ever 
before 
shown 
himself.

When<p>
he 
reached 
home 
it 
was 
already 
getting 
dark. 
Some 
eight 
people<p>
had
come 
to 
see 
him 
that 
evening: 
the 
secretary 
of 
a 
committee, 
the 
colonel
of 
his 
battalion, 
his 
steward, 
his<p>
major-domo, 
and 
various 
petitioners.
They 
all 
had 
business 
with 
Pierre 
and 
wanted 
decisions 
from 
him. 
Pierre
did 
not 
understand 
and 
was 
not 
interested 
in 
any 
of 
these
