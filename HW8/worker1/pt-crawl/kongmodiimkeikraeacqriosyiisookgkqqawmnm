that 
he</h1>had 
difficulty 
in 
getting 
a
dinner. 
Two 
officers 
of 
his 
own 
division 
joined 
him. 
The 
conversation
naturally 
turned 
on 
the 
peace. 
The 
officers, 
his 
comrades,<p>
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/MjR5A9Fmd9tTlW.html">like</a> 
most 
of
the 
army, 
were 
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
peace 
concluded 
after 
the 
battle 
of
Friedland. 
They 
said 
that 
had 
we 
<a href="/aVzUge/qQ69oFcgw4PUmnH.html">held</a> 
out 
a 
little 
longer 
Napoleon 
would
have 
been 
done 
for, 
as 
his 
troops 
had 
neither 
provisions 
nor 
ammunition.
Nicholas 
ate 
and 
drank 
(chiefly 
the 
latter) 
in 
silence. 
He 
finished 
a
couple 
of 
bottles 
of 
wine 
by 
himself. 
The 
process 
in 
his 
mind 
went 
on
tormenting 
<a href="/aVzUge/CB4W7ZhuM9hpNsY.html">him</a> 
without 
reaching 
a 
conclusion. 
He 
feared 
to 
give 
way 
to
his 
thoughts, 
yet 
could 
not 
get 
rid 
of 
them. 
Suddenly, 
on 
one 
of 
the
officers' 
saying 
that 
it 
was 
humiliating 
to 
look 
at 
the 
French,
Rostov 
began 
shouting 
with 
uncalled-for 
wrath, 
and 
therefore 
much 
to
the 
surprise 
of 
the 
officers:

"How 
can 
you 
judge 
what's 
best?" 
he 
cried, 
the 
blood 
suddenly
rushing 
to 
his 
face. 
"How 
can 
you 
judge 
the 
Emperor's 
actions? 
What
right 
have 
we 
to 
argue? 
We 
cannot 
comprehend 
either 
the 
Emperor's 
aims
or 
his 
actions!"

"But 
I 
never 
said 
a 
word 
about 
the 
Emperor!" 
said 
the 
officer,
justifying 
himself, 
and 
unable 
to 
understand 
Rostov's 
outburst,
except 
on 
the 
supposition 
that 
he 
was 
drunk.

But 
Rostov 
did 
not 
listen 
to 
him.

"We 
are 
not 
diplomatic 
officials, 
we 
are 
soldiers 
and 
nothing 
more,"
he 
went 
on. 
"If 
we 
are 
ordered 
to 
die, 
we 
must 
die. 
If 
we're
punished, 
it 
means 
that 
we 
have 
deserved 
it, 
it's 
not 
for 
us 
to 
judge.
If 
the 
Emperor 
pleases 
to 
recognize 
Bonaparte
