The 
count</h1>ordered 
his 
carriage 
that 
he 
might 
drive 
to 
Sokolniki, 
and 
sat
in 
his 
study 
with 
folded<p>
hands, 
morose, 
<a href="/nocrawl/c8Rhi6R/dc12G3.html">sallow,</a> 
and 
taciturn.

In 
quiet 
and 
untroubled 
times 
it 
<a href="/aVzUge/au2EXJo3yFQ4.html">seems</a> 
to 
every 
administrator 
that 
it
is 
only 
by 
his 
efforts 
that 
the 
whole 
population 
under 
his 
rule 
is
kept 
going, 
and 
in 
this 
consciousness 
of 
being 
indispensable 
every
administrator 
finds 
the 
chief 
reward 
of 
his 
labor 
and 
efforts. 
While 
the
sea 
of 
history 
remains 
calm 
the 
ruler-administrator 
in 
his 
frail 
bark,
holding 
on 
with 
a 
boat 
hook 
to 
the 
ship 
of 
the 
people 
and 
himself
moving, 
naturally 
imagines 
that 
his 
efforts 
move 
the 
ship 
he 
is 
holding
on 
to. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
a 
storm 
arises 
and 
the 
sea 
begins 
to 
heave 
and
the 
ship 
to 
move, 
such 
a 
delusion 
is 
no 
longer 
possible. 
The 
ship 
moves
independently 
with 
its 
own 
enormous 
motion, 
the 
boat 
hook 
no 
longer
reaches 
the 
moving 
vessel, 
and 
suddenly 
the 
administrator, 
instead
of 
appearing 
a 
ruler 
and 
a 
source 
of 
power, 
becomes 
an 
insignificant,
useless, 
feeble 
man.

Rostopchin 
felt 
this, 
and 
it 
was 
this 
which 
exasperated 
him.

The 
superintendent 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Wb49N5l.html">police,</a> 
whom 
the 
crowd 
had 
stopped, 
went 
in 
to
see 
him 
at 
the 
same 
time 
as 
an 
adjutant 
who 
informed 
the 
count 
that 
the
horses 
were 
harnessed. 
They 
were 
both 
pale, 
and 
the 
superintendent 
of
police, 
after 
reporting 
that 
he 
had 
executed 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/Lp5NDX6Cv7KXJ.html">instructions</a> 
he 
had
received, 
informed 
the 
count 
that 
an 
immense 
crowd 
had 
collected 
in 
the
courtyard
