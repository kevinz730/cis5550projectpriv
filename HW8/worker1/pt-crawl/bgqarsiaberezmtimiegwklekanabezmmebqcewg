tree, 
and 
with 
all
your 
chivalry 
just 
the 
same." 
He 
paused. 
"However, 
we 
must 
get 
to 
work.
Tell 
the 
Cossack 
to 
fetch 
my 
kit. 
I 
have 
two 
French 
uniforms 
in 
it.
Well, 
are 
you 
coming 
with 
me?"<p>
he 
asked 
Petya.

"I? 
Yes, 
yes, 
certainly!" 
cried 
Petya, 
blushing 
almost 
to 
tears 
and
glancing 
at 
Denisov.

While 
Dolokhov 
had 
been 
disputing 
with 
Denisov 
what 
<a href="/aVzUge/FTI9CmwX4HAb0aKB.html">should</a> 
be 
done 
with
prisoners, 
Petya 
had 
once 
more 
felt 
awkward 
and 
restless; 
but 
again 
he
had 
no 
time 
to 
grasp 
fully 
what 
they 
were 
talking 
about. 
"If 
grown-up,
distinguished 
men 
think 
so, 
it 
must 
be 
necessary 
and 
right," 
thought 
he.
"But 
above 
all<p>
Denisov 
<a href="/cZl/Nq9G66WxVb.html">must</a> 
not<p>
dare 
to 
imagine 
that 
I'll 
obey 
him 
and
that 
<a href="/aVzUge/NhF8l41x.html">he</a> 
can 
order 
me 
about. 
I 
will 
certainly 
go 
to 
the 
French 
camp 
with
Dolokhov. 
If 
he 
can, 
so 
can 
I!"

And 
to 
all 
Denisov's 
persuasions,<p>
Petya 
replied 
that 
he 
too 
was
accustomed 
to 
do 
everything 
accurately 
and 
not 
just 
anyhow, 
and 
that 
he
never 
considered<p>
personal 
danger.

"For 
you'll 
admit 
that<p>
if 
we 
don't 
know 
for 
sure 
how 
many 
of 
them 
there
are... 
hundreds 
of 
lives 
may 
depend 
on 
it, 
while 
there 
are 
only 
two
of 
us. 
Besides, 
I 
want 
to 
go 
very 
much 
and 
certainly 
will 
go, 
so 
don't
hinder 
me," 
said 
he. 
"It 
will 
only 
make 
things 
worse...."





CHAPTER 
IX

Having 
put 
on 
French 
greatcoats 
and 
shakos, 
Petya 
and 
Dolokhov 
rode 
to
the 
clearing 
from 
which 
Denisov 
had 
reconnoitered 
the 
French 
camp,
and 
emerging 
from 
the 
forest 
in 
pitch 
darkness 
they 
descended 
into 
the
hollow. 
On 
reaching 
the 
bottom, 
Dolokhov 
told 
the 
Cossacks 
accompanying
him 
to 
await 
him 
there 
and 
rode 
on 
at 
a 
quick 
trot 
along 
the 
road 
to 
the
bridge. 
Petya, 
his 
heart 
in 
his 
mouth 
with 
excitement, 
rode 
by 
his 
side.

"If 
we're<p>
caught, 
I 
won't 
be 
taken 
alive! 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZLk8MCK3bju5WkvgW.html">I</a> 
have 
a 
pistol," 
whispered
he.

"Don't 
talk 
Russian," 
said 
Dolokhov 
in 
a 
hurried 
whisper, 
and 
at 
that
very 
moment 
they 
heard 
through 
the 
darkness 
the 
challenge: 
"Qui 
vive?"<p>
*
and 
the 
click 
of 
a 
musket.

 
 
 
 
* 
"Who 
goes 
there?"


The 
blood 
rushed 
to 
Petya's 
face 
and 
he 
grasped 
his 
pistol.

"Lanciers 
du 
6-me," 
* 
replied 
Dolokhov, 
neither 
hastening 
nor 
slackening
his 
horse's 
pace.
