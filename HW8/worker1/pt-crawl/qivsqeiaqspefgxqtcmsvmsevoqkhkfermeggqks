"How's 
it 
you're 
not 
drunk 
today?" 
said 
Nesvitski 
when 
the
other 
had 
ridden 
up 
to 
him.

"They 
don't 
even 
give 
one 
time 
to 
dwink!" 
answered 
Vaska
Denisov. 
"They 
keep 
dwagging 
the 
wegiment 
to 
and 
fwo 
all 
day. 
If 
they
mean 
to 
fight, 
let's 
fight. 
But 
the 
devil 
knows 
what 
this 
is."

"What 
a 
dandy 
you 
are 
today!" 
said 
Nesvitski, 
looking 
at
Denisov's 
new 
cloak 
and 
saddlecloth.

Denisov 
smiled, 
took 
out 
of 
his 
sabretache 
a 
handkerchief 
that 
diffused
a 
smell 
of 
perfume, 
and 
put 
it 
to 
Nesvitski's 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Fcn8HQTp6BPULq5fOHvf.html">nose.

"Of</a> 
course. 
I'm 
going 
into 
action! 
I've 
shaved, 
bwushed 
my 
teeth,
and 
scented 
myself."

The 
imposing 
figure 
of 
Nesvitski 
followed 
by 
his 
Cossack, 
and
the 
determination 
of 
Denisov 
who 
flourished 
his 
sword 
and 
shouted
frantically, 
had 
such 
an 
effect 
that 
they 
managed 
to 
squeeze 
through
to 
the 
farther 
side 
of 
the 
bridge 
and 
stopped 
the 
infantry. 
Beside 
the
bridge 
Nesvitski 
found 
the 
colonel 
to 
whom 
he 
had 
to 
deliver 
the 
order,
and 
having 
done 
this 
he 
<a href="/aVzUge/VX8CBzhL3dS8MdWa.html">rode</a> 
back.

Having 
cleared 
the 
way 
Denisov 
stopped 
at 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tQ8A8ZR.html">end</a> 
of 
the 
bridge.
Carelessly 
holding 
in 
his 
stallion 
that 
was 
neighing 
and 
pawing 
the
ground, 
eager 
to 
rejoin 
its 
fellows,<p>
he 
watched 
his 
squadron 
draw
nearer. 
Then 
the 
clang 
of 
hoofs, 
as 
of 
several 
horses 
galloping,
resounded 
on 
the<p>
planks 
of 
the 
bridge, 
and 
the 
squadron, 
officers 
in
front 
and 
men 
four 
abreast, 
spread 
across 
the 
bridge 
and 
began 
to 
emerge
on 
his 
side 
of 
it.

The 
infantry 
who 
had 
been 
stopped 
crowded 
near 
the 
bridge 
in 
the
trampled 
mud 
and 
gazed 
with 
that 
particular 
feeling 
of 
ill-will,
estrangement, 
and 
ridicule 
with 
which 
troops 
of 
different 
arms 
usually
encounter 
one 
another 
at 
the 
clean, 
smart 
hussars 
who 
moved 
past 
them 
in
regular 
order.

"Smart 
lads! 
Only 
fit 
for 
a 
fair!" 
said 
one.

"What 
good 
are 
they? 
They're 
led 
about 
just 
for 
show!" 
remarked
another.

"Don't<p>
kick 
up 
the 
dust, 
you 
infantry!" 
jested 
an 
hussar 
whose
prancing 
horse 
had 
splashed 
mud 
over 
some 
foot 
soldiers.

"I'd 
like 
to 
put 
you 
on 
a 
two 
days' 
march 
with 
a 
knapsack! 
Your
fine 
cords 
would 
soon 
get 
a 
bit 
rubbed," 
said 
an 
infantryman, 
wiping
the 
mud 
off 
his 
face 
with 
his 
sleeve. 
"Perched 
up 
there, 
you're 
more
like 
a 
bird 
than 
a 
man."

"There 
now, 
Zikin, 
they 
ought 
to 
put 
you 
on 
a 
horse. 
You'd 
look
fine," 
said 
a 
corporal, 
chaffing 
a 
thin 
little 
soldier 
who 
bent 
under
the 
weight 
of 
his 
knapsack.

"Take 
a 
stick 
between 
your 
legs, 
that'll 
suit 
you 
for 
a 
horse!"
the 
hussar 
shouted 
back.





CHAPTER 
VIII

The 
last 
of 
the 
infantry 
hurriedly 
crossed 
the 
bridge,<p>
squeezing
together 
as 
they 
approached 
it 
as 
if 
passing 
through 
a 
funnel. 
At 
last
the 
baggage 
wagons 
had 
all 
crossed, 
the 
crush 
was 
less, 
and 
the 
last
battalion 
came 
onto 
the 
bridge. 
Only 
Denisov's 
squadron 
of 
hussars
remained 
on 
the 
farther 
side 
of 
the 
bridge 
facing 
the 
enemy, 
who 
could
be 
seen 
from 
the 
hill 
on 
the 
opposite 
bank 
but 
was 
not 
yet 
visible 
from
the 
bridge, 
for 
the 
horizon 
as 
seen 
from 
the 
valley 
through 
which 
the
river 
flowed 
was 
formed 
by 
the 
rising 
ground 
only 
half 
a 
mile 
away.
At 
the 
foot 
of 
the<p>
hill 
lay 
wasteland 
over 
which 
a 
few 
groups 
of 
our
Cossack 
scouts 
were 
moving. 
Suddenly 
on 
the 
road 
at 
the 
top 
of 
the 
high
ground, 
artillery 
and 
troops 
in 
blue 
uniform 
were 
seen. 
These 
were 
the
French. 
A 
group 
of 
Cossack 
scouts 
retired 
down 
the 
hill 
at 
a 
trot. 
All
the 
officers 
and 
men 
of 
Denisov's 
squadron, 
though 
they 
tried 
to 
talk
of 
other 
things 
and 
to 
look 
in 
other 
directions, 
thought 
only 
of 
what
was 
there 
on 
the 
hilltop, 
and 
kept 
constantly 
looking 
at 
the 
patches
appearing 
on 
the 
skyline, 
which 
they 
knew 
to 
be 
the 
enemy's 
troops.
The 
weather 
had 
cleared 
again 
since 
noon 
and 
the 
sun 
was 
descending
brightly 
upon 
the 
Danube 
and 
the 
dark 
hills 
around 
it. 
It 
was 
calm, 
and
at 
intervals 
the 
bugle 
calls 
and 
the 
shouts 
of 
the 
enemy 
could 
be 
heard
from<p>
the 
hill. 
There 
was 
no 
one 
now 
between 
the 
squadron 
and 
the 
enemy
except
