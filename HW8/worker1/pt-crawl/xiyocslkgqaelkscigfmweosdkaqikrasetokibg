He 
understood

completely,

leaving 
the

crying, 
went 
silently 
up
to 
Natasha 
who

CHAPTER

Prince 
Andrew 
know 
he 
would 
die, 
but 
he 
felt 
that 
he 
was
dying

an 
aloofness 
from
everything 
earthly 
and 
a 
strange 
and 
joyous 
lightness 
of 
existence.
Without

or 
agitation 
he 
awaited 
what 
was 
coming. 
That 
inexorable,
eternal, 
distant, 
and 
unknown

continually 
all 
his 
life-was 
now

to 
him 
and, 
by 
the 
strange
lightness 
he 
experienced, 
almost
