final 
indications 
that 
it 
was
necessary 
to 
order 
an 
attack, 
and 
it 
was 
fixed 
for 
the 
fifth 
of 
October.

On 
the 
morning 
of 
the 
fourth 
of 
October 
Kutuzov 
signed 
the 
dispositions.
Toll 
read 
them 
to 
Ermolov, 
asking 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/me60s7mrwmb.html">him</a> 
to 
attend 
to 
the 
further
arrangements.

"All 
right-all 
right. 
I 
haven't 
time 
just 
now," 
replied 
Ermolov, 
and
left 
the 
hut.

The 
dispositions 
drawn 
up 
by 
Toll 
were 
very<p>
good. 
As 
in 
the 
Austerlitz
dispositions, 
it 
was 
written-though 
not 
in 
German 
this 
time:

"The 
First 
Column 
will 
march 
here 
and 
here," 
"the 
Second 
Column 
will
march 
<a href="/cZl/DU5e23A.html">there</a> 
and 
there," 
and 
so 
on; 
and 
on 
paper, 
all 
these 
columns
arrived 
at 
their 
places 
at 
the 
appointed 
time 
and 
destroyed 
the 
enemy.
Everything 
had 
been 
admirably 
thought 
out 
as 
is 
usual 
in 
dispositions,
and 
as 
is 
always 
the 
case, 
not 
a 
single 
column 
reached 
its 
place 
at 
the
appointed 
time.

When 
the 
necessary 
number 
of 
copies 
of 
the 
dispositions 
had 
been
prepared, 
an 
officer 
was 
summoned 
and 
sent 
to 
deliver 
them 
to 
Ermolov
to 
deal 
with. 
A 
young 
officer 
of 
the 
Horse 
Guards, 
Kutuzov's 
orderly,
pleased 
at 
the 
importance 
of 
the 
mission 
entrusted 
to 
him, 
went 
to
Ermolov's 
quarters.

"Gone 
away," 
said 
Ermolov's 
orderly.

The 
officer 
of 
the 
Horse 
Guards 
went 
to 
a 
general 
with 
whom
