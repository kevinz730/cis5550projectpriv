excited. 
Not
noticing 
the 
monk, 
who</h1>had 
risen 
to 
greet 
her 
and 
was 
drawing 
back 
the
wide 
sleeve 
on 
his 
right 
arm, 
she 
went 
up 
to 
Sonya 
and 
took 
her 
hand.

"Natasha, 
what 
are 
you 
about? 
Come 
here!" 
said 
the 
countess.

Natasha 
went 
up 
to 
the 
monk 
for 
his 
blessing, 
and 
he 
advised 
her 
to 
pray
for 
aid 
to 
God 
and 
His 
saint.

As 
soon 
as 
the 
prior 
withdrew, 
Natasha 
took 
her 
friend 
by 
the 
hand 
and
went 
with 
her 
into 
the 
unoccupied 
room.

"Sonya, 
will 
he 
live?" 
she 
asked. 
"Sonya, 
how 
happy 
I 
am, 
and 
how
unhappy!... 
Sonya, 
dovey, 
everything 
is 
as 
it 
used 
to 
be. 
If 
only 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/JU9RPq9tiRgR9b.html">he
lives!</a> 
He 
cannot... 
because... 
because... 
of..." 
and 
Natasha 
burst 
into
tears.

"Yes! 
I 
knew 
<a href="/cZl/io9bKMVG1gcFtr4IEXzL.html">it!</a> 
Thank 
God!" 
murmured 
Sonya. 
"He 
will 
live."

Sonya 
was 
not 
less 
agitated 
than 
her 
friend 
by 
the 
latter's 
fear 
and
grief 
and 
by 
her 
own 
personal 
feelings 
which 
she 
shared 
with 
no 
one.
Sobbing, 
she 
kissed 
and 
comforted 
Natasha. 
"If 
only 
he 
lives!" 
she
thought. 
Having 
wept, 
talked, 
and 
wiped 
away 
their 
tears, 
the 
two
friends 
went 
together 
to 
Prince 
Andrew's 
door. 
Natasha 
opened 
it
cautiously 
and 
glanced 
into 
the 
room, 
Sonya 
standing 
beside 
her 
at 
the
half-open 
door.

Prince 
Andrew 
was 
lying 
raised 
high 
on 
three 
pillows. 
His 
pale 
face 
was
calm, 
his 
eyes 
closed, 
and 
they 
could 
see<p>
his 
regular 
breathing.

"O, 
Natasha!" 
Sonya 
suddenly 
almost 
screamed, 
catching 
her 
companion's
arm 
and 
stepping 
back 
from 
the 
door.

"What? 
What 
is 
it?" 
asked 
Natasha.

"It's 
that, 
that..." 
said 
Sonya, 
with 
a 
white 
face 
and 
trembling 
lips.

Natasha 
softly 
closed 
the 
door 
and 
went 
with 
Sonya 
to 
the 
window, 
not
yet 
understanding 
what 
the 
latter 
was 
telling 
her.

"You 
remember," 
said 
Sonya 
with 
a 
solemn 
and 
frightened 
expression.
"You 
remember 
when 
I 
looked 
in 
the 
mirror 
for 
you... 
at 
Otradnoe 
at
Christmas? 
Do 
you 
remember 
what 
I 
saw?"

"Yes, 
yes!" 
cried 
Natasha 
opening 
her 
eyes 
wide, 
and 
vaguely 
recalling
that 
Sonya 
had 
told 
her 
something 
about 
Prince 
Andrew 
whom 
she 
had 
seen
lying 
down.

"You 
remember?" 
Sonya 
went 
on. 
"I 
saw 
it 
<a href="/cZl/iY9T0hyP6qd.html">then</a> 
and 
told 
everybody, 
you
and 
Dunyasha. 
I 
saw 
him 
lying 
on 
a 
bed," 
said 
she, 
making 
a 
gesture 
with
her 
hand 
and 
a 
lifted 
finger 
at 
each 
detail, 
"and 
that 
he 
had 
his 
eyes
closed 
and 
was 
covered 
just 
with 
a 
pink 
quilt, 
and 
that 
his 
hands 
were
folded," 
she 
concluded, 
convincing 
herself 
that 
the 
details 
she 
had 
just
seen 
were 
exactly 
what 
she 
had 
seen 
in 
the 
mirror.

She 
had 
in 
fact 
seen 
nothing 
then 
but 
had 
mentioned 
the 
first 
thing 
that
came 
into 
her 
head, 
but 
what 
she 
had 
invented 
then 
seemed 
to 
her 
now
as 
real 
as 
any 
<a href="/aVzUge/yG8p.html">other</a> 
recollection. 
She 
not 
only 
remembered 
what 
she 
had
then 
said-that 
he 
turned 
to 
look 
at 
her 
and 
smiled 
and 
was 
covered 
with
something 
red-but 
was 
firmly 
convinced 
that 
she 
had 
then 
seen
