colonel 
whether 
he 
would 
not 
take 
a 
French
officer 
into 
his 
hut 
to 
warm 
him, 
and 
when 
the 
messenger 
returned 
and
said 
that 
the 
colonel 
wished 
the 
officer 
to 
be 
brought 
to 
him, 
Ramballe
was 
told 
to 
go. 
He 
rose 
and 
tried 
to 
walk, 
but 
staggered 
and 
would 
have
fallen 
had 
not 
a 
soldier 
standing 
by 
held 
him 
up.

"You 
won't 
do 
it 
again, 
eh?" 
said 
one 
of 
the 
soldiers, 
winking 
and
turning 
mockingly 
to 
Ramballe.

"Oh, 
you 
fool! 
Why 
talk 
rubbish, 
lout 
that 
you 
are-a 
real 
peasant!" 
came
rebukes<p>
from 
all 
sides 
addressed 
to 
the 
jesting<p>
soldier.

They 
surrounded 
Ramballe, 
lifted 
him 
on 
the 
crossed 
arms 
of 
two
soldiers, 
and 
carried 
him 
to 
the 
hut. 
Ramballe 
put 
his 
arms 
around 
their
necks 
while 
they 
carried 
him 
and 
began 
wailing 
plaintively:

"Oh, 
you 
fine 
fellows, 
my 
kind, 
kind 
friends! 
These 
are 
men! 
Oh, 
my
brave, 
kind 
friends," 
and 
he 
leaned 
his 
head 
against 
the 
shoulder<p>
of 
one
of 
the 
men 
like 
a 
child.

Meanwhile 
Morel 
was 
sitting 
in 
the 
best 
place 
by 
the 
fire, 
surrounded 
by
the 
soldiers.

Morel,<p>
a 
short 
sturdy 
Frenchman 
with 
inflamed 
and 
streaming 
eyes, 
was
wearing 
a 
woman's 
cloak 
and 
had 
a 
shawl 
tied 
woman 
fashion 
round 
his
head 
over 
his 
cap. 
He 
was 
evidently 
tipsy, 
and 
was 
singing 
a 
French 
song
in 
a 
hoarse 
broken 
voice, 
with 
an<p>
arm 
thrown 
round 
the 
nearest 
soldier.
The 
soldiers 
simply 
held 
their 
sides 
as 
they 
watched 
him.

"Now 
then, 
now 
then, 
teach 
us 
how 
it 
goes! 
I'll 
soon 
pick 
it 
up.<p>
How 
is
it?" 
said 
the 
man-a 
singer 
and 
a 
wag-whom 
Morel 
was 
embracing.

"Vive 
Henri 
Quatre! 
Vive 
ce 
roi 
valiant!" 
sang 
Morel, 
winking. 
"Ce
diable 
a 
quatre..." 
*

 
 
 
 
 
* 
"Long 
live 
Henry 
the 
Fourth, 
that 
valiant 
king! 
That 
rowdy
 
 
 
 
 
devil."


"Vivarika! 
Vif-seruvaru! 
Sedyablyaka!" 
repeated 
the 
soldier, 
flourishing
his 
arm 
and 
really 
catching 
the 
tune.

"Bravo! 
Ha, 
ha, 
ha!" 
rose 
their 
rough, 
joyous 
laughter 
from 
all 
sides.

Morel, 
wrinkling 
up 
his 
face, 
laughed 
too.

"Well, 
go 
on, 
go 
on!"

 
 
 
 
"Qui 
eut 
le 
triple 
talent,
 
 
 
 
De 
boire, 
de 
battre,
 
 
 
 
Et 
d'etre 
un 
vert 
galant." 
*

 
 
 
 
 
 
* 
Who 
had 
a 
triple 
talent
 
 
 
 
 
 
For 
drinking, 
for 
fighting,
 
 
 
 
 
 
And 
for 
being 
a 
gallant 
old 
boy...

"It 
goes 
smoothly, 
too. 
Well, 
now, 
Zaletaev!"

"Ke..." 
Zaletaev, 
brought 
out 
with 
effort: 
"ke-e-e-e," 
he 
drawled,
laboriously 
pursing 
his 
lips, 
"le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, 
e
de-tra-va-ga-la" 
he 
sang.

"Fine! 
Just 
like 
the 
Frenchie! 
Oh, 
ho 
ho! 
Do 
you 
want 
some 
more 
to 
eat?"

"Give 
him 
some 
porridge: 
it 
takes 
a 
long 
time 
to 
get 
filled 
up 
after
starving."

They 
gave 
him 
some 
more 
porridge 
and 
Morel 
with 
a 
laugh 
set 
to 
work 
on
his 
third 
bowl. 
All 
the 
young 
soldiers 
smiled 
gaily 
as 
they
