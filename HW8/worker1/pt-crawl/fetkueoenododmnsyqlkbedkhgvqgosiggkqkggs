the 
crupper 
of 
his</h1>horse. 
The 
boy 
held 
on 
to 
the
hussar 
with 
cold, 
red 
hands, 
and 
raising 
his 
eyebrows 
gazed 
about 
him
with 
surprise. 
This<p>
was 
the 
French 
drummer 
boy 
captured 
that 
morning.

Behind 
them 
along 
the 
narrow, 
sodden, 
cut 
up 
forest 
road 
came 
hussars 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZLk8MCK3bju5WkvgW.html">in
threes</a> 
and 
fours, 
and 
then 
Cossacks: 
some 
in 
felt 
cloaks, 
some 
in 
French
greatcoats, 
and 
some 
with 
horsecloths 
over 
their 
heads. 
The 
horses,
being 
drenched 
by<p>
the 
rain, 
all 
looked 
black 
whether 
chestnut 
or 
bay.
Their 
necks, 
with 
their 
wet, 
close-clinging 
manes, 
looked 
strangely
thin. 
Steam 
rose 
from 
them. 
Clothes, 
saddles, 
reins, 
were 
all 
wet,
slippery, 
and 
sodden, 
like 
the 
ground 
and 
the 
fallen 
leaves 
that 
strewed
the 
road. 
The 
men 
sat 
huddled 
up 
trying 
not 
to 
stir, 
so 
as 
to 
warm 
the
water 
that 
had 
trickled 
to 
their 
bodies 
and 
not 
admit 
the 
fresh 
cold
water 
that 
was 
leaking 
in 
<a href="/aVzUge/zp4qQqw29HrxvL.html">under</a> 
their 
seats, 
their 
knees, 
and 
at 
the
back 
of 
their 
necks. 
In 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
outspread 
line 
of 
Cossacks 
two
wagons, 
drawn 
by 
French 
horses 
and 
by 
<a href="/cZl/Fm9vf18.html">saddled</a> 
Cossack 
horses 
that 
had
been 
hitched 
on 
in 
front, 
rumbled 
over 
the 
tree 
stumps 
and 
branches 
and
splashed 
through 
the 
water 
that 
lay 
in 
the 
ruts.

Denisov's 
horse 
swerved 
aside 
to 
avoid 
a 
pool 
in 
the 
track 
and 
bumped
his 
rider's 
knee 
against 
a 
tree.

"Oh, 
the 
devil!" 
exclaimed 
Denisov 
angrily, 
and 
showing 
his 
teeth 
he
struck 
his 
horse 
three 
times 
with 
his 
whip, 
splashing 
himself 
and 
his
comrades 
with 
mud.

Denisov 
was 
out 
of 
sorts 
both 
because 
of 
the 
rain 
and 
also 
from 
hunger
(none 
of 
them 
had 
eaten 
anything 
since 
morning), 
and<p>
yet 
more 
because 
he
still 
had 
no 
news 
from 
Dolokhov 
and 
the 
man 
sent 
to 
capture 
a 
"tongue"
had 
not 
returned.

"There'll 
hardly 
be 
another 
such 
chance 
to 
fall 
on 
a 
transport 
as 
today.
It's 
too 
risky 
to 
attack 
them 
by 
oneself, 
and 
if 
we 
put 
it 
off 
till
another 
day 
one 
of 
the 
big 
guerrilla 
detachments 
will 
snatch 
the 
prey
from 
under 
our 
noses," 
thought 
Denisov, 
continually 
peering 
forward,
hoping 
to 
see 
a 
messenger 
from 
Dolokhov.

On 
coming 
to 
a 
path 
in 
the 
forest 
along 
which 
he 
could 
see 
far 
to 
the
right, 
Denisov 
stopped.

"There's 
someone 
coming," 
said 
he.

The 
esaul 
looked 
in 
the 
direction 
Denisov
