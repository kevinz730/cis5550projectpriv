not 
cause 
the 
least</h1>embarrassment 
to 
Countess 
Bezukhova, 
who 
evidently
deserved 
her 
reputation 
of 
being 
a 
very 
clever 
woman. 
Had 
she 
attempted
concealment, 
or 
tried 
to 
extricate 
herself 
from 
her 
awkward 
position
by 
cunning, 
she 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/PX8PUEsy69.html">would</a> 
have 
spoiled 
her 
case 
by 
acknowledging 
herself
guilty. 
But 
Helene, 
like 
a 
really 
great 
man 
who 
can 
do 
whatever
he 
pleases,<p>
at 
once 
assumed 
her 
own 
position 
to 
be 
correct, 
as 
she
sincerely 
believed 
it 
to 
be, 
and 
that 
everyone 
else 
was 
to 
blame.

The 
first 
time 
the 
young 
foreigner 
allowed 
himself 
to 
reproach 
her, 
she
lifted 
her 
beautiful 
head 
and, 
half 
turning 
to 
him, 
said 
firmly: 
"That's
just 
like 
a 
man-selfish 
and 
cruel! 
I 
expected 
nothing 
else. 
A 
woman
sacrifices 
herself 
for 
you, 
she 
suffers, 
and 
<a href="/nocrawl/c8Rhi6R/TSZ5Y8vVJZj3.html">this</a> 
is 
her 
reward! 
What
right 
have 
you, 
monseigneur, 
to 
demand 
an 
account 
of 
my 
attachments 
and
friendships? 
He 
is 
a 
man 
who 
has 
been 
more 
than 
a 
father 
to 
me!" 
The
prince 
was 
about 
to 
say 
something, 
but 
Helene 
interrupted 
him.

"Well, 
yes," 
said 
she, 
"it 
may 
be 
that 
he 
has 
other 
sentiments 
for 
me
than 
those 
of 
a 
father, 
but 
that 
is 
not 
a 
reason 
for 
me 
to 
shut 
my 
door
on 
him. 
I 
am 
not 
a 
man, 
that 
I 
should 
repay 
kindness 
with 
ingratitude!
Know, 
monseigneur, 
that 
in 
all 
that 
relates 
to 
my 
intimate 
feelings 
I
render 
account 
only 
to 
God 
and 
to 
my 
conscience," 
she 
concluded, 
laying
her 
hand 
on 
her 
beautiful, 
fully 
expanded 
bosom 
and 
looking 
up 
to
heaven.

"But 
for 
heaven's 
sake 
listen 
to 
me!"

"Marry 
me, 
and 
I 
will 
be 
your 
slave!"

"But 
that's 
impossible."

"You 
won't 
deign 
<a href="/cZl/rP5vE4Gj3M.html">to</a> 
demean 
yourself 
by 
marrying 
me, 
you..." 
said 
Helene,
beginning 
to 
cry.

The 
prince 
tried 
to 
comfort 
her, 
but 
Helene, 
as 
if 
quite 
distraught,
said 
through 
her 
tears 
that 
there 
was 
nothing 
to 
prevent 
her 
marrying,
that 
there 
were 
precedents 
(there 
were 
up 
to 
that 
time 
very 
few, 
but
she 
mentioned 
Napoleon 
and 
some 
other 
exalted 
personages), 
that 
she 
had
never 
been 
her 
husband's 
wife, 
and 
that 
she 
had 
been 
sacrificed.

"But 
the 
law, 
religion..." 
said 
the 
prince, 
already 
yielding.

"The 
law, 
religion... 
What 
have 
they 
been 
invented 
for 
if<p>
they 
can't
arrange 
that?" 
said 
Helene.

The 
prince 
was 
surprised 
that 
so 
simple 
<a href="/aVzUge/qi4V4ieowf1.html">an</a> 
idea 
had 
not 
occurred 
to 
him,
and 
he 
applied 
for 
advice 
to 
the 
holy 
brethren 
of 
the 
Society 
of 
Jesus,
with 
whom 
he 
was 
on 
intimate 
terms.

A 
few 
days 
later 
at 
one 
of 
those 
enchanting 
fetes 
which 
Helene 
gave 
at
her 
country 
house 
on 
the 
Stone 
Island, 
the 
charming 
Monsieur 
de 
Jobert,
a 
man<p>
no 
longer 
young, 
with 
snow 
white 
hair 
and 
brilliant 
black 
eyes,
a 
Jesuit 
a 
robe 
courte 
* 
was 
presented 
to 
her, 
and 
in 
<a href="/aVzUge/bfW6Gj0w8.html">the</a> 
garden 
by 
the
light 
of 
the 
illuminations 
and 
to 
the 
sound 
of 
music 
talked 
to 
her 
for 
a
long 
time 
of 
the 
love 
of 
God, 
of 
Christ, 
of 
the 
Sacred 
Heart, 
and 
of 
the
consolations 
the 
one 
true 
Catholic 
religion 
affords 
in 
this 
world 
and
the 
next. 
Helene 
was 
touched, 
and 
more 
than 
once 
tears 
rose 
to 
her 
eyes
and 
to 
those 
of 
Monsieur 
de 
Jobert 
and 
their 
voices 
trembled. 
A 
dance,
for 
which 
her 
partner 
came 
to 
seek 
her, 
put 
an 
end 
to 
her 
discourse 
with
her 
future 
directeur 
de 
conscience, 
but 
the 
next 
evening 
Monsieur 
de
Jobert<p>
came 
to 
see 
Helene 
when 
she 
was 
alone, 
and 
after 
that 
often 
came
again.

Lay 
member 
of 
the 
Society 
of 
Jesus.

One 
day 
he 
took 
the 
countess 
to 
a<p>
Roman 
Catholic 
church, 
where 
she 
knelt
down 
before 
the 
altar 
to 
which 
she 
was 
led. 
The 
enchanting, 
middle-aged
Frenchman 
laid 
his 
hands 
on 
her 
head 
and, 
as 
she 
herself 
afterward
described 
it, 
she 
felt 
something 
like 
a 
fresh 
breeze 
wafted 
into 
her
soul. 
It 
was
