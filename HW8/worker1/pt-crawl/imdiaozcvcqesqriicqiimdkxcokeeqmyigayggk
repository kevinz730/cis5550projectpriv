It 
seemed 
as 
if 
from 
some</h1>words 
Boris 
had 
spoken 
that 
evening 
about 
the
Prussian 
army, 
Helene 
had 
suddenly 
found 
it 
necessary 
to 
see 
him.
She 
seemed 
to 
promise 
to<p>
explain 
that 
necessity 
to 
him 
when 
he 
came 
on
Tuesday.

But 
on 
Tuesday 
evening, 
having 
come 
to 
Helene's 
splendid 
salon,
Boris 
received 
no 
clear 
explanation 
of 
why 
it 
had 
been 
necessary 
for
him 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NY9D9lLv5g.html">to</a> 
come. 
There 
were 
other 
guests 
and 
the 
countess 
talked 
little 
to
him, 
and 
only 
as 
he 
kissed 
her 
hand 
on 
taking 
leave 
said 
unexpectedly
and<p>
in 
a 
whisper, 
with 
a 
strangely 
unsmiling 
face: 
"Come 
to 
dinner
tomorrow... 
in 
the 
evening. 
You 
must 
come.... 
Come!"

During 
that 
stay 
in 
Petersburg, 
Boris 
became 
an 
intimate 
in 
the
countess' 
house.





CHAPTER 
VIII

The 
war 
was 
flaming 
up 
and 
nearing 
the 
Russian 
frontier. 
Everywhere 
one
heard 
curses 
on 
Bonaparte, 
"the 
enemy 
of 
mankind." 
Militiamen 
and
recruits 
were 
being 
enrolled 
in 
the 
villages, 
and 
from 
the 
seat 
of
war 
came 
contradictory 
news, 
false 
as 
usual 
and 
therefore 
variously
interpreted. 
The 
life 
of 
old 
Prince 
Bolkonski, 
Prince 
Andrew, 
and
Princess 
Mary 
<a href="/aVzUge/MV4i45.html">had</a> 
greatly 
changed 
since 
1805.

In 
1806 
the 
old 
prince 
was 
made 
one 
of 
the 
eight 
commanders 
in 
chief
then 
appointed 
to 
supervise 
the 
enrollment 
decreed 
throughout 
Russia.
Despite 
the 
weakness 
of 
age, 
which 
had 
become 
particularly 
noticeable
since 
the 
time 
when 
he 
thought 
his 
son 
had 
been 
killed, 
he 
did 
not 
think
it 
right 
to 
refuse 
a<p>
duty 
to 
which 
he 
had 
been 
appointed 
by 
the 
Emperor
himself, 
and 
this 
fresh 
opportunity 
for 
action 
gave 
him 
new 
energy
and 
strength. 
He 
was 
continually 
traveling 
through 
the 
three 
provinces
entrusted 
to 
him, 
was 
pedantic 
in 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
his 
duties, 
severe
to 
cruel 
with 
his 
subordinates, 
and 
went 
into 
everything 
down 
to 
the
minutest 
details<p>
himself. 
<a href="/nocrawl/c8Rhi6R/Wt8C0oW8ZkSv.html">Princess</a> 
Mary 
had 
ceased 
taking 
lessons 
in
mathematics 
from 
her 
father, 
and 
when 
the 
old 
prince 
was 
at 
home 
went
to 
his 
study 
with 
the 
wet 
nurse 
and 
little 
Prince 
Nicholas 
(as 
his
grandfather 
called 
him). 
The 
baby 
Prince 
Nicholas 
lived 
with 
his 
wet
nurse 
and 
nurse 
Savishna 
in 
the 
late 
princess' 
rooms 
and 
Princess
Mary 
spent 
most 
of 
the 
day 
in 
the 
nursery, 
taking 
a 
mother's 
place 
to
her 
little 
nephew 
as<p>
best 
she 
could. 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
too, 
seemed
passionately 
fond 
of 
the 
boy, 
and 
Princess 
Mary 
often 
deprived 
herself
to 
give 
her 
friend 
the 
pleasure 
of 
dandling 
the 
little 
<a href="/aVzUge/hW2bXmQ81KA.html">angel-as</a> 
she
called 
her<p>
nephew-and 
playing 
with 
him.

Near 
the 
altar 
of 
the 
church 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
there 
was 
a 
chapel 
over 
the
tomb 
of 
the 
little 
princess, 
and 
in 
this 
chapel 
was 
a 
marble 
monument
brought 
from 
Italy, 
representing 
an 
angel 
with 
outspread 
wings 
ready 
to
fly 
upwards. 
The 
angel's 
upper 
lip 
was 
slightly 
raised 
as 
though
about 
to 
smile, 
and 
once 
on 
coming 
out 
of 
the 
chapel 
Prince 
Andrew 
and
Princess 
Mary 
admitted 
to 
one 
another 
that 
the 
angel's 
face 
reminded
them 
strangely 
of 
the 
little 
princess. 
But 
what 
was 
still 
stranger,
