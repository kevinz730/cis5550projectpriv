half 
his 
men.</h1>He 
said 
the 
attack
had 
been 
repulsed, 
employing 
this 
military 
term 
to 
describe 
what 
had
occurred 
to 
his 
regiment, 
but 
in 
reality 
he 
did 
not 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/iU2tHdfO2Qqw7.html">himself</a> 
know 
what
had 
happened 
during 
that 
half-hour 
to 
the 
troops 
entrusted 
to 
him, 
and
could 
not 
say 
with 
certainty 
whether 
the 
attack 
had 
been 
repulsed 
or 
his
regiment 
had 
been 
broken 
up. 
All 
he 
knew 
was 
that 
at 
the 
commencement
of 
the 
action 
balls 
and 
shells 
began 
flying 
all 
over 
his 
regiment 
and
hitting 
men 
and 
that 
afterwards 
someone 
had 
shouted 
"Cavalry!" 
and
our 
men 
had 
begun 
firing. 
They 
were 
still 
firing, 
not 
at 
the 
cavalry
which 
had 
disappeared, 
but 
at 
French 
infantry 
who 
had 
come 
into 
the
hollow 
and 
were 
firing 
at 
our 
men. 
Prince 
Bagration 
bowed 
his 
head 
as 
a
sign 
that 
this 
was 
exactly 
what 
he 
had 
desired 
and 
expected. 
Turning
to 
his 
adjutant 
he 
ordered 
him 
to 
bring 
down 
the 
two 
battalions 
of 
the
Sixth 
Chasseurs 
whom 
they 
had 
just 
passed. 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
struck 
by
the 
changed 
expression 
on 
Prince 
Bagration's 
face 
at 
this 
moment. 
It
expressed 
the 
concentrated 
and 
happy 
resolution 
you 
see 
on 
the 
face 
of
a 
man 
who 
on 
a 
hot 
day 
takes 
a 
final 
run 
before 
plunging 
into 
the 
water.
The 
dull, 
sleepy<p>
expression 
was 
no 
longer 
there, 
nor 
the 
affectation
of 
profound 
thought. 
The 
round, 
steady, 
hawk's 
eyes 
looked 
before 
him
eagerly 
and 
rather 
disdainfully, 
not 
resting 
on 
anything 
although 
his
movements 
were 
still 
slow 
and 
measured.

The 
commander 
of 
the 
regiment 
turned 
to 
Prince 
Bagration, 
entreating
him 
to 
go 
back 
as 
it 
was 
too 
dangerous 
to 
remain 
where 
they 
were.
"Please, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NXJ5AHAK.html">your</a> 
excellency,<p>
for 
God's 
sake!" 
he 
kept 
saying,
glancing 
for 
support 
at 
an 
officer 
of 
the 
suite 
who 
turned 
away
from 
him. 
"There, 
you 
see!" 
and 
he 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
bullets
whistling, 
singing, 
and 
hissing 
continually 
around 
them. 
He<p>
spoke 
in 
the
tone 
of 
entreaty 
and 
reproach 
that 
a 
carpenter 
uses 
to 
a 
gentleman 
who
has 
picked 
up 
an 
ax: 
"We 
are 
used 
to 
it, 
but 
you, 
sir, 
will 
blister
your 
hands." 
He 
spoke 
as 
if 
those 
bullets 
could 
not 
kill 
him, 
and 
his
half-closed 
eyes 
gave 
still 
more 
persuasiveness 
to 
his 
words. 
The 
staff
officer 
joined 
in 
the 
colonel's 
appeals, 
but 
Bagration 
did 
not 
reply;
he 
only 
gave 
an 
order 
to 
cease 
firing 
and 
re-form, 
so 
as 
to 
give 
room
for 
the 
two 
approaching 
battalions. 
While 
he 
was 
speaking, 
the 
curtain
of 
smoke 
that 
had 
concealed 
the 
hollow, 
driven 
by 
a 
rising 
wind, 
began
to 
move 
from 
right 
to 
left 
as 
if 
drawn 
by 
an 
invisible 
hand, 
and 
the
hill 
opposite, 
with 
the 
French 
moving 
about 
on 
it, 
opened 
out 
before
them. 
All 
eyes 
fastened 
involuntarily 
on 
this 
French 
column 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/di6HV1ohMq7NSCk.html">advancing
against</a> 
them 
and 
winding 
down 
over 
the 
uneven 
ground. 
One 
could 
already
see 
the 
soldiers' 
shaggy 
caps, 
distinguish 
the 
officers 
from 
the 
men,
and
