This</h1>battle, 
which 
consisted 
in<p>
the 
capture 
of 
a 
French 
squadron, 
was
represented 
as 
a 
brilliant 
victory 
over 
the 
French, 
and 
so 
the
Emperor 
and 
the 
whole 
army, 
especially 
while 
the 
smoke 
hung 
over
the 
battlefield, 
believed 
that 
the 
French 
had 
been 
defeated 
and 
were
retreating 
against 
their 
will. 
A 
few 
minutes 
after 
the 
Emperor 
had
passed, 
the 
Pavlograd 
division 
was 
ordered 
to 
advance. 
In 
Wischau
itself, 
a 
petty 
German 
town, 
Rostov 
saw 
the 
Emperor 
again. 
In 
the
market 
place, 
<a href="/aVzUge/Gd2ioN4Kzb7qLBzM.html">where</a> 
there 
had 
been 
some 
rather 
heavy 
firing 
before 
the
Emperor's 
arrival, 
lay 
several 
killed 
and 
wounded 
soldiers 
whom 
there
had<p>
not 
been 
time 
to 
move. 
The 
Emperor, 
surrounded 
by 
his 
suite
of 
officers 
and 
courtiers, 
was 
riding 
a 
bobtailed 
chestnut 
mare, 
a
different 
one 
from 
that 
which 
he 
had 
ridden 
at 
the 
review, 
and 
bending
to 
one 
side 
he 
gracefully 
held 
a 
gold 
lorgnette 
to 
his 
eyes 
and 
looked
at 
a 
soldier 
who 
lay 
prone, 
with 
blood 
on 
his 
uncovered 
head. 
The
wounded 
soldier 
was 
so 
dirty, 
coarse, 
and 
revolting 
that 
his 
proximity
to 
the 
Emperor 
shocked 
Rostov. 
Rostov 
saw 
how 
the 
Emperor's 
rather
round 
shoulders 
shuddered 
as 
if 
a 
cold 
shiver 
had 
run 
down 
them, 
how 
his
left 
foot 
began 
convulsively 
tapping 
the 
horse's 
side 
with 
the 
spur,
and 
how 
the 
well-trained 
horse 
looked 
round 
unconcerned 
and 
did 
not
stir. 
An 
adjutant, 
dismounting, 
lifted 
the 
soldier 
under 
the 
arms 
to
place 
him 
on 
a 
stretcher 
that 
had 
been 
brought. 
The 
soldier 
groaned.

"Gently, 
gently! 
Can't<p>
you 
do 
it 
more 
gently?" 
said 
the 
Emperor
apparently 
suffering 
more 
than 
the 
dying 
soldier, 
and 
he 
rode 
away.

Rostov 
saw 
tears 
filling 
the 
Emperor's 
eyes 
and 
heard 
him, 
as 
he 
was
riding 
away, 
say 
to 
Czartoryski: 
"What 
a 
terrible 
thing 
war 
is: 
what
a 
terrible 
thing! 
Quelle 
terrible 
chose 
que 
la 
guerre!"

The 
troops 
of 
the 
vanguard 
were 
stationed 
before 
Wischau, 
within 
sight
of 
the 
enemy's 
lines, 
which 
all 
day 
long 
had 
yielded 
ground 
to 
us
at 
the 
least 
firing. 
The 
Emperor's 
gratitude 
was 
announced 
to 
the
vanguard, 
rewards 
were 
promised, 
and 
the 
men 
received 
a 
double 
ration 
of
vodka. 
The 
campfires 
crackled 
and 
the 
soldiers' 
songs 
resounded
even 
more 
merrily 
than 
on 
the 
previous 
night. 
Denisov 
celebrated 
his
promotion 
to 
the 
rank 
of 
major, 
and 
Rostov, 
who 
had 
already 
drunk
enough, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
feast 
proposed 
the 
Emperor's 
health. 
"Not
'our 
Sovereign, 
the 
Emperor,' 
as 
they 
say 
at 
official 
dinners,"
said 
he, 
"but 
the 
health 
of 
our 
Sovereign, 
that 
good, 
enchanting, 
and
great 
man! 
Let 
us 
drink 
to 
his 
health 
and 
to 
the 
certain 
defeat 
of 
the
French!"

"If 
we 
fought 
before," 
he 
said, 
"not 
letting 
the 
French 
pass, 
as
at 
Schoen 
Grabern, 
what 
shall 
we 
not 
do 
now 
when 
he 
is
