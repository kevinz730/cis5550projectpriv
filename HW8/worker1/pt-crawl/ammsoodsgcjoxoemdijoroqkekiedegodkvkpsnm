Come,

That 
their 
fire 
gets 
into 
his 
eyes 
and 
he 
forgets 
that
 
 
 
 
 
he 
ought 
to 
be 
firing 
at 
the 
enemy.

"It 
may 
be 
treachery," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
vividly 
imagining 
the
gray 
overcoats, 
wounds, 
the 
smoke 
of 
gunpowder, 
the 
sounds 
of 
firing,
and 
<a href="/cZl/hK9It2AJH8Ztx.html">the</a> 
glory 
that 
awaited 
him.

"Not 
that 
either. 
That 
puts 
the 
court 
in 
too<p>
bad 
a 
light," 
replied
Bilibin. 
"It's 
not 
treachery 
nor 
rascality 
nor 
stupidity: 
it 
is
just 
as 
at 
Ulm... 
it 
is..."-he 
seemed 
to 
be 
trying 
to 
find 
the 
right
expression. 
"C'est... 
c'est 
du 
Mack. 
Nous 
sommes 
mackes 
(It 
is...
it 
is 
a 
bit 
of 
Mack. 
We 
are 
Macked)," 
he 
concluded, 
feeling 
that 
he
had 
produced 
a 
good 
epigram, 
a 
fresh 
one 
that 
would 
be 
repeated. 
His
hitherto 
puckered 
brow 
became 
smooth 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
pleasure, 
and 
with 
a
slight 
smile 
he 
began 
to 
examine 
his 
nails.

"Where 
are 
you 
off 
to?" 
he 
said 
suddenly 
to 
Prince 
Andrew 
who 
had
risen 
and 
was 
going 
toward 
his 
room.

"I 
am 
going 
away."

"Where 
to?"

"To 
the 
army."

"But 
you 
meant<p>
to 
stay 
another 
two 
days?"

"But 
now 
I 
am 
off 
at 
once."

And 
Prince 
Andrew 
after 
giving 
directions 
about 
his 
departure 
went 
to
his 
room.

"Do 
you 
know, 
mon 
cher," 
said 
Bilibin 
following 
him, 
"I 
have 
been
thinking 
about 
you. 
Why 
are 
you 
going?"

And 
in 
proof 
of 
the 
conclusiveness 
of 
his 
opinion 
all 
the 
wrinkles
vanished 
from 
his 
face.

Prince 
Andrew 
looked 
inquiringly 
at 
him 
and 
gave 
no 
reply.

"Why 
are 
you 
going? 
I 
know 
you 
think 
it 
your 
duty 
to 
gallop 
back 
to
the 
army 
now 
that 
it 
is 
in 
danger.<p>
I 
understand 
that. 
Mon 
cher, 
it 
is
heroism!"

"Not 
at 
all," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew.

"But 
as 
you 
are 
a 
philosopher, 
be 
a 
consistent 
one, 
look 
at 
the 
other
side 
of 
the 
question 
and 
you 
will 
see 
that 
your 
duty, 
on 
the 
contrary,
is 
to 
take 
care 
of 
yourself. 
Leave 
it 
to 
those 
who 
are 
no 
longer 
fit 
for
anything 
else.... 
You 
have 
not 
been 
ordered 
to 
return 
and 
have 
not 
been
dismissed 
from 
here; 
therefore, 
you 
can 
stay 
and 
go 
with 
us 
wherever 
our
ill 
luck 
takes 
us. 
They 
say 
we 
are 
going 
to 
Olmuetz, 
and 
Olmuetz 
is 
a
very 
decent 
town. 
You 
and 
I 
will 
travel 
comfortably 
in 
my 
caleche."

"Do 
stop 
joking, 
Bilibin," 
cried 
Bolkonski.

"I 
am 
speaking 
sincerely 
as 
a 
friend! 
Consider! 
Where 
and 
why 
are
you 
going, 
when 
you 
might 
remain 
here? 
You 
are 
faced 
by 
one 
of 
two
things," 
and 
the 
skin 
over 
his 
left 
temple 
puckered, 
"either 
you
will 
not 
reach 
your 
regiment 
before 
peace 
is 
concluded, 
or 
you 
will
share 
defeat 
and 
disgrace 
with 
Kutuzov's 
whole 
army."

And 
Bilibin 
unwrinkled 
his 
temple, 
feeling 
that 
the 
dilemma 
was
insoluble.

"I 
cannot 
argue 
about 
it," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew 
coldly, 
but 
he
thought: 
"I 
am 
going
