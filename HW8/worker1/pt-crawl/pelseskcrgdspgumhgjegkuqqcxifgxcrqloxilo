I 
have 
come 
to</h1>do 
so 
today. 
I 
never 
experienced 
anything
like 
it 
before. 
I 
am 
in 
love, 
my 
friend!"

Suddenly 
Pierre 
heaved 
a 
deep 
sigh 
and 
dumped 
his 
heavy 
person 
down 
on
the 
sofa 
beside 
Prince 
Andrew.

"With 
Natasha 
Rostova, 
yes?" 
said 
he.

"Yes, 
yes! 
Who 
else 
should 
it 
be? 
I 
should 
never 
have 
believed 
it,
but 
the 
feeling 
is 
stronger 
than 
I. 
Yesterday 
I 
tormented 
myself 
and
suffered, 
but 
I 
would 
not 
exchange 
even 
that 
torment 
for 
anything 
in
the 
world, 
I 
have 
not 
lived 
till 
now. 
At 
last 
I 
live, 
but 
I 
can't
live 
without 
her! 
But 
can 
she 
love 
me?... 
I 
am 
too 
old 
for 
her....<p>
Why
don't 
you 
speak?"

"I? 
I? 
What 
did 
I 
tell 
you?" 
said 
Pierre 
suddenly, 
rising 
and
beginning 
to 
pace 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room. 
"I 
always 
thought 
it.... 
That
girl 
is 
such 
a 
treasure... 
she 
is 
a 
rare 
girl.... 
My 
dear 
friend,
I 
entreat 
you, 
don't 
philosophize, 
don't 
doubt, 
marry, 
marry,
marry.... 
And 
I 
am 
sure 
there 
will 
not 
be 
a 
happier 
man 
than 
you."

"But 
what 
of 
her?"

"She 
loves 
you."

"Don't 
talk 
rubbish..." 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
smiling 
and 
looking
into 
Pierre's 
eyes.

"She 
does, 
I 
know," 
Pierre 
cried 
fiercely.

"But 
do 
listen," 
returned 
Prince 
Andrew, 
holding 
him 
by 
the
arm. 
"Do 
you 
know 
the 
condition 
I 
am 
in? 
I 
must 
talk 
about 
it 
to
someone."

"Well, 
go 
on, 
go 
on. 
I 
am 
very 
glad," 
said 
Pierre, 
and 
his 
face
really 
changed, 
his 
brow 
became 
smooth, 
and 
he 
listened 
gladly 
to 
Prince
Andrew. 
Prince 
Andrew 
seemed, 
and 
really 
was, 
quite 
a 
different, 
quite
a 
new 
man. 
Where 
was 
his 
spleen, 
his 
contempt 
for 
life, 
his
disillusionment? 
Pierre 
was 
the 
only 
person 
to 
whom 
he 
made 
up 
his 
mind
to 
speak 
openly; 
and 
to 
him 
he 
told 
all 
that 
was 
in 
his 
soul. 
Now 
he
boldly 
and 
lightly 
made 
plans 
for 
an 
extended 
future, 
said 
he 
could 
not
sacrifice 
his 
own 
happiness 
to 
his 
father's 
caprice,<p>
and 
spoke 
of 
how
he 
would 
either 
make 
his<p>
father 
consent 
to 
this 
marriage 
and 
love 
her,
or 
would 
do 
without 
his 
consent; 
then 
he 
marveled 
at 
the 
feeling 
that
had 
mastered 
him 
as 
at 
something 
strange, 
apart 
from 
and 
independent 
of
himself.

"I 
should 
not 
have 
believed 
anyone 
who 
told 
me 
that 
I 
was 
capable 
of
such 
love," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew. 
"It 
is 
not 
at 
all 
the 
same 
feeling
that 
I 
knew 
in 
the 
past.
