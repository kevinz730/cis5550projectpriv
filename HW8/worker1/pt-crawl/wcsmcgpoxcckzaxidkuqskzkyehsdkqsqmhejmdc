in 
regeneration," 
said 
Pierre,
with 
a 
trembling 
voice 
and 
some 
difficulty 
in 
utterance 
due 
to 
his
excitement 
and 
to 
being 
unaccustomed 
to 
speak 
of 
abstract 
matters 
in
Russian.

"What 
is 
your 
conception 
of 
Freemasonry?"

"I 
imagine 
that 
Freemasonry 
is 
the 
fraternity 
and 
equality 
of 
men 
who
have 
virtuous 
aims," 
said 
Pierre, 
feeling 
ashamed 
of 
the 
inadequacy
of 
his 
words 
for 
the 
solemnity 
of 
the 
moment, 
as 
he 
spoke. 
"I
imagine..."

"Good!" 
said 
the 
Rhetor 
quickly, 
apparently 
satisfied 
with
this 
answer. 
"Have 
you 
sought 
for 
means 
of 
attaining 
your 
aim 
in
religion?"

"No, 
I 
considered 
it 
erroneous 
and 
did 
not 
follow 
it," 
said 
Pierre,
so 
softly 
that 
the<p>
Rhetor 
did 
not 
hear 
him 
and 
asked 
him 
what 
he 
was
saying. 
"I 
have 
been 
an 
atheist," 
answered 
Pierre.

"You 
are 
seeking 
for 
truth 
in 
order 
to 
follow 
its 
laws 
in 
your 
life,
therefore 
you 
seek 
wisdom 
and 
virtue. 
Is 
that 
not 
so?" 
said 
the
Rhetor, 
after 
a 
moment's 
pause.

"Yes, 
yes," 
assented 
Pierre.

The 
Rhetor 
cleared 
his 
throat, 
crossed 
his 
gloved 
hands 
on 
his 
breast,
and 
began 
to 
speak.

"Now 
I 
must 
disclose 
to 
you<p>
the 
chief 
aim 
of 
our 
Order," 
he 
said,
"and 
if 
this 
aim 
coincides 
with 
yours, 
you 
may 
enter 
our 
Brotherhood
with 
profit. 
The 
first 
and 
chief 
object 
of 
our 
Order, 
the 
foundation 
on
which 
it 
rests 
and 
which 
no 
human 
power 
can 
destroy, 
is 
the 
preservation
and 
handing 
on 
to 
posterity 
of 
a 
certain 
important 
mystery... 
which
has 
come 
down 
to 
us 
from 
the 
remotest 
ages, 
even 
from 
the 
first 
man-a
mystery 
on 
which 
perhaps 
the 
fate 
of 
mankind 
depends. 
But 
since 
this
mystery 
is 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
that 
nobody 
can 
know 
or 
use 
it 
unless 
he 
be
prepared 
by 
long 
and 
diligent 
self-purification, 
not 
everyone 
can 
hope
to 
attain 
it 
quickly. 
Hence 
we 
have 
a 
secondary 
aim, 
that 
of 
preparing
our 
members 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
to 
reform 
their 
hearts, 
to 
purify 
and
enlighten 
their 
minds, 
by 
means 
handed 
on 
to 
us 
by 
tradition 
from 
those
who 
have 
striven 
to 
attain 
this 
mystery, 
and 
thereby 
to 
render 
them
capable 
of 
receiving 
it.

"By 
purifying 
and 
regenerating 
our 
members 
we 
try, 
thirdly, 
to 
improve
the<p>
whole 
human 
race, 
offering 
it 
in 
our 
members 
an 
example 
of 
piety
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/rh2BwOO9vVJZj8.html">virtue,</a> 
and 
thereby 
try 
with<p>
all 
our 
might 
to 
combat 
the 
evil 
which
sways 
the 
world. 
Think 
this 
over 
and 
I 
will 
come 
to 
you 
again."

"To 
combat 
the 
evil 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oz9U6ntIh8.html">which</a> 
sways 
the 
world..." 
Pierre 
repeated, 
and 
a
mental 
image 
of 
his 
future 
activity 
in 
this 
direction 
rose 
in 
his 
mind.
He 
imagined 
men 
such 
as 
he 
had 
himself 
been 
a 
fortnight 
ago, 
and 
he
addressed 
an 
edifying 
exhortation 
to 
them. 
He 
imagined 
to 
himself
vicious 
and 
unfortunate 
people 
whom 
he 
would 
assist 
by 
word
