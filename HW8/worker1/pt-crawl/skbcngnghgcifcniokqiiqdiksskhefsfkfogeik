CHAPTER 
XIII

One 
night 
when 
the 
old 
countess, 
in 
nightcap 
and 
dressing 
jacket,
without 
her 
false 
curls, 
and 
with 
her 
poor 
little 
knob 
of 
hair 
showing
under 
her 
white 
cotton 
cap, 
knelt 
sighing 
and 
groaning 
on 
a 
rug 
and
bowing 
to 
the 
ground 
in 
prayer, 
her 
door 
<a href="/cZl/sL9N2kW.html">creaked</a> 
and 
Natasha, 
also 
in
a 
dressing 
jacket 
with 
slippers 
on 
her 
bare 
feet 
and 
her 
hair 
in
curlpapers, 
ran 
in. 
The 
countess-her 
prayerful 
mood 
dispelled-looked
round 
and 
frowned. 
She 
was 
finishing 
her 
last 
prayer: 
"Can 
it 
be 
that
this 
couch 
will 
be 
my 
grave?" 
Natasha, 
flushed 
and 
eager, 
seeing
her 
mother 
in 
prayer, 
suddenly 
checked 
her 
rush, 
half 
sat 
down, 
and
unconsciously 
put 
out 
her 
tongue 
as 
if 
chiding 
herself. 
Seeing 
that
her 
mother 
was 
still 
praying 
she 
ran 
on 
tiptoe 
to 
the 
bed 
and, 
rapidly
slipping 
one 
little 
foot 
against 
the 
other, 
pushed 
off 
her 
slippers 
and
jumped 
onto 
the 
bed 
the 
countess 
had 
feared 
might 
become 
her 
grave. 
This
couch 
was 
high, 
with 
a 
feather 
bed 
and 
five 
pillows 
each 
smaller 
than
the 
one 
below. 
Natasha 
jumped 
on 
it, 
sank 
into 
the 
feather 
bed, 
rolled
over 
to 
the 
wall, 
and 
began 
snuggling 
up 
the 
bedclothes 
as 
she 
settled
down, 
raising 
her 
knees 
to 
her 
chin, 
kicking 
out 
and 
laughing 
almost
inaudibly, 
now 
covering 
herself 
up 
head 
and 
all, 
and 
now 
peeping 
at 
her
mother. 
The 
countess 
finished 
her 
prayers 
and 
came 
to 
the 
bed 
with 
a
stern 
face, 
but 
seeing 
that 
Natasha's 
head 
was 
covered, 
she 
smiled
in 
her 
kind, 
weak 
way.

"Now 
then, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vi2Pe7QJprO9e.html">now</a> 
then!" 
said 
she.

"Mamma, 
can 
we 
have 
a 
talk? 
Yes?" 
said 
Natasha. 
"Now, 
just 
one 
on
your 
throat 
and 
another... 
that'll 
do!" 
And 
seizing 
her 
mother 
round
the 
neck, 
she 
kissed 
her 
on 
the 
throat. 
In 
her 
behavior 
to 
her 
mother
Natasha 
seemed 
rough, 
but 
she 
was 
so 
sensitive 
and 
tactful 
that 
however
she 
clasped 
her 
mother 
she 
always 
managed 
to 
do 
it 
without 
hurting 
her
or 
making 
her 
feel 
uncomfortable 
or 
displeased.

"Well, 
what 
is 
it 
tonight?" 
said 
the 
mother, 
having 
arranged 
her
pillows 
and 
waited 
until 
Natasha, 
after 
turning 
over 
a 
couple 
of 
times,
had 
settled 
down 
beside 
her 
under 
the 
quilt,<p>
spread 
out 
her 
arms, 
and
assumed 
a 
serious 
expression.

These 
visits 
of 
Natasha's 
at 
night 
before 
the 
count 
returned 
from 
his
club 
were 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
pleasures 
of 
both 
mother, 
and 
daughter.

"What 
is 
it 
tonight?-But 
I 
have 
to 
tell 
you..."

Natasha 
put 
her 
hand 
on 
her 
mother's 
mouth.

"About 
Boris... 
I 
know," 
she 
said 
seriously; 
"that's 
what 
I
have 
come 
about. 
Don't 
say 
it-I 
know. 
No, 
do 
tell 
me!" 
and 
she
removed 
her 
hand. 
"Tell
