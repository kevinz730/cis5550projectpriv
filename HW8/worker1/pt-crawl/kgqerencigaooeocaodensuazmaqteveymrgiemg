enthusiasm

love 
for 
his 
sovereign
rose 
again 
in 
Rostov's<p>
soul 
in 
all 
its 
old 
force. 
In 
the 
uniform 
of
the 
Preobrazhensk 
regiment-white 
chamois-leather 
breeches 
and 
high
boots-and 
wearing 
a 
star 
Rostov 
did 
not 
know 
(it 
was 
that 
of 
the
Legion 
d'honneur), 
the 
monarch 
came 
out 
into 
the 
porch, 
putting 
on
his 
gloves 
and 
carrying 
his 
hat 
under 
his 
arm. 
He 
stopped 
and 
looked
about 
him, 
brightening 
everything 
around 
by 
his 
glance. 
He 
spoke 
a 
few
words 
to 
some 
of 
the 
generals, 
and, 
recognizing 
the 
former 
commander 
of
Rostov's 
division, 
smiled 
and 
beckoned 
to 
him.

All 
the 
suite 
drew 
back 
and 
Rostov 
saw 
the 
general 
talking 
for 
some
time 
to 
the 
Emperor.

The 
Emperor 
said 
a 
few 
words 
to 
him 
and 
took 
a 
step 
toward 
his 
horse.
Again 
the 
crowd 
of 
members 
of 
the 
suite 
and 
street 
gazers 
(among 
whom
was 
Rostov) 
moved 
nearer 
to 
the 
Emperor. 
<a href="/aVzUge/PC6XKBx6fnq.html">Stopping</a> 
beside 
his 
horse,
with 
his 
hand 
on 
the 
saddle, 
the 
Emperor 
turned 
to 
the 
cavalry 
general
and 
said 
in 
a 
loud 
voice, 
evidently 
wishing 
to 
be 
heard 
by 
all:

"I 
cannot 
do 
it, 
General. 
I 
cannot, 
because 
the 
law 
is 
stronger

he 
raised 
his

to

stirrup.

The

bowed 
his

the

mounted

rode 
down 
the 
street 
at

Beside

CHAPTER 
XXI

The 
Emperor 
rode 
to 
the 
square 
where, 
facing 
one 
another, 
a 
battalion
of 
the 
Preobrazhensk 
regiment 
stood 
on 
the 
right 
and 
a 
battalion 
of 
the
French 
Guards 
in 
their 
bearskin 
caps 
on 
the 
left.

As 
the 
Tsar 
rode 
up 
to 
one 
flank 
of 
the 
battalions, 
which 
presented
arms, 
another 
group 
of 
horsemen 
galloped 
up 
to 
the 
opposite 
flank, 
and
at 
the 
head 
of 
them 
Rostov 
recognized 
Napoleon. 
It 
could 
be 
no 
one
else. 
He 
came 
at 
a 
gallop, 
wearing 
a 
small 
hat, 
a 
blue 
uniform 
open 
over
a 
white 
vest, 
and 
the 
St. 
Andrew 
ribbon 
over 
his 
shoulder. 
He 
was 
riding
a 
very 
fine 
thoroughbred 
gray 
Arab 
horse 
with 
a 
crimson 
gold-embroidered
saddlecloth. 
On 
approaching 
Alexander 
he 
raised 
his 
hat, 
and 
as 
he 
did
so, 
Rostov, 
with 
his 
cavalryman's 
eye, 
could 
not 
help 
noticing
that 
Napoleon 
did 
not 
sit 
well 
or 
firmly 
in 
the 
saddle. 
The 
battalions
shouted 
"Hurrah!" 
and 
"Vive 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bF8Ro21viB.html">l'Empereur!"</a> 
Napoleon 
said
something 
to 
Alexander, 
and 
both 
Emperors 
dismounted 
and 
took 
each
other's 
hands. 
Napoleon's 
face 
wore 
an 
unpleasant 
and 
artificial
smile. 
Alexander 
was 
saying 
something 
affable
