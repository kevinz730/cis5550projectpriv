this 
that 
Daniel's 
voice 
was 
heard 
calling 
ulyulyu.
The 
sounds 
of 
both 
packs 
mingled 
and 
broke 
apart 
again, 
but 
both 
were
becoming 
more 
distant.

Simon 
sighed 
and 
stooped 
to 
straighten 
the 
leash 
a 
young 
borzoi 
had
entangled; 
the 
count 
too 
sighed 
and, 
noticing 
the 
snuffbox 
in 
his 
hand,
opened 
it 
and 
took 
a 
pinch. 
"Back!" 
cried 
Simon 
to 
a 
borzoi 
that
was 
pushing 
forward 
out 
of 
the 
wood. 
The 
count 
started 
and 
dropped 
the
snuffbox. 
Nastasya 
Ivanovna 
dismounted 
to 
pick 
it 
up. 
The 
count 
and
Simon 
were 
looking 
at 
him.

Then, 
unexpectedly, 
as 
often 
happens, 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
hunt 
suddenly
approached, 
as 
if 
the 
hounds 
in 
full 
cry 
and 
Daniel 
ulyulyuing 
were 
just
in 
front 
of 
them.

The 
count 
turned 
and 
saw 
on 
his 
right 
Mitka 
staring 
at 
him 
with 
eyes
starting 
out 
of 
his 
head, 
raising 
his 
cap 
and 
pointing 
before 
him 
to 
the
other 
side.

"Look 
out!" 
he 
shouted, 
in 
a 
voice 
plainly 
showing 
that 
he 
had 
long
fretted 
to 
utter 
that 
word, 
and 
letting 
the 
borzois 
slip 
he 
galloped
toward 
the 
count.

The 
count 
and 
Simon 
galloped 
out 
of 
the 
wood 
and 
saw 
on 
their 
left 
a
wolf 
which, 
softly 
swaying 
from 
side 
to 
side, 
was 
coming 
at 
a 
quiet
lope 
farther 
to 
the 
left 
to 
the 
very 
place 
where 
they 
were
