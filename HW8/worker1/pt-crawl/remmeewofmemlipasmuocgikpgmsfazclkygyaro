his 
face 
hidden 
by 
his 
beaver 
collar 
and 
his
head 
slightly 
bent. 
His 
face 
was 
fresh 
and 
rosy, 
his 
white-plumed 
hat,
tilted 
to 
one 
side, 
disclosed 
his 
curled 
and 
pomaded 
hair 
besprinkled
with 
powdery 
snow.

"Yes, 
indeed, 
that's 
a 
true 
sage," 
thought 
Pierre. 
"He 
sees 
nothing
beyond 
the 
pleasure 
of 
the 
moment, 
nothing 
troubles 
him<p>
and 
so 
he 
is
always 
cheerful, 
satisfied, 
and 
serene. 
What 
wouldn't<p>
I 
give 
to 
be 
like
him!" 
he 
thought 
enviously.

In 
Marya 
Dmitrievna's 
anteroom 
the 
footman 
who 
helped 
him 
off 
with 
his
fur 
coat 
said 
that 
the 
mistress 
asked 
him 
to 
come 
to 
her 
bedroom.

When 
he 
opened 
the 
ballroom 
door 
Pierre 
saw 
Natasha 
sitting 
at 
the
window, 
with 
a 
thin, 
pale, 
and 
spiteful 
face. 
She 
glanced 
round 
at 
him,
frowned, 
and 
left 
the 
room 
with 
an 
expression 
of 
cold 
dignity.

"What 
has 
happened?" 
asked 
Pierre, 
entering 
Marya 
Dmitrievna's 
room.

"Fine 
doings!" 
answered 
Dmitrievna. 
"For 
fifty-eight 
years 
have 
I 
lived
in 
this 
world 
and 
never 
known 
anything 
so 
disgraceful!"

And 
having 
put 
him 
on 
his 
honor 
not 
to 
repeat 
anything 
she 
told 
him,
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
informed 
him 
that 
Natasha 
had 
refused 
Prince 
Andrew
without 
her 
parents' 
knowledge 
and<p>
that 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
was 
Anatole
Kuragin 
into 
whose 
society 
Pierre's 
wife 
had 
thrown 
her 
and<p>
with 
whom
Natasha 
had 
tried 
to 
elope 
during 
her 
father's 
absence, 
in 
order 
to 
be
married 
secretly.

Pierre 
raised 
his 
shoulders 
and 
listened 
open-mouthed 
to 
what 
was 
told
him, 
scarcely 
able 
to 
believe 
his 
own 
ears. 
That 
Prince 
Andrew's
deeply 
loved 
affianced 
wife-the 
same 
Natasha 
Rostova 
who 
used 
to 
be 
so
charming-should 
give 
up 
Bolkonski 
for 
that 
fool 
Anatole 
who 
was 
already
secretly 
married 
(as 
Pierre 
knew), 
and 
should 
be 
so 
in 
love 
with 
him 
as
to 
agree 
to 
run 
away 
with 
him, 
was 
something 
Pierre 
could 
not 
conceive
and 
could 
not 
imagine.

He 
could 
not 
reconcile 
the 
charming 
impression 
he 
had 
of 
Natasha, 
whom
he 
had 
known 
from 
a 
child, 
with 
this 
new 
conception 
of 
her 
baseness,
folly, 
and 
cruelty. 
He 
thought 
of 
his 
wife. 
"They 
are 
all 
alike!" 
he
said 
to 
himself, 
reflecting 
that 
he 
was 
not 
the 
only 
man 
unfortunate
enough 
to 
be 
tied 
to 
a 
bad 
woman. 
But 
still 
he 
pitied 
Prince 
Andrew 
to
the 
point 
of 
tears 
and 
sympathized 
with 
his 
wounded 
pride, 
and 
the 
more
he 
pitied 
his 
friend 
the 
more 
did 
he 
think 
with 
contempt 
and 
even 
with
disgust 
of 
that 
Natasha 
who 
had 
just 
passed 
him 
in 
the 
ballroom 
with
such 
a 
look 
of 
cold 
dignity. 
He 
did 
not 
know 
that 
Natasha's 
soul 
was
overflowing 
with 
despair, 
shame, 
and 
humiliation, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
not
her 
fault 
that 
her 
face 
happened 
to 
assume 
an 
expression 
of 
calm 
dignity
and 
severity.

"But 
how 
get 
married?" 
said 
Pierre, 
in 
answer 
to 
Marya 
Dmitrievna. 
"He
could 
not 
marry-he 
is 
married!"

"Things 
get 
worse 
from 
hour 
to 
hour!" 
ejaculated 
Marya 
Dmitrievna. 
"A
nice 
youth! 
What 
a 
scoundrel! 
And 
she's 
expecting 
him-expecting 
him
since 
yesterday. 
She 
must 
be 
told! 
Then 
at 
least 
she 
won't 
go 
on
expecting 
him."
