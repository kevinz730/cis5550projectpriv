the 
snow 
and 
on 
the</h1>path. 
This 
path 
led 
to 
the 
barn. 
The 
log
walls 
of 
the 
barn 
and 
its 
snow-covered 
roof, 
that 
looked 
as 
if 
hewn 
out
of 
some 
precious<p>
stone, 
sparkled 
in 
the 
moonlight. 
A 
tree 
in 
the 
garden
snapped 
with 
the 
frost, 
and 
then 
all 
was 
again 
perfectly 
silent. 
His
bosom 
seemed 
to 
inhale 
not 
air 
but 
the 
strength 
of 
eternal 
youth 
and
gladness.

From 
the 
back 
porch 
came 
the 
sound 
of 
feet 
descending 
the 
steps, 
the
bottom 
step 
upon 
which 
snow 
had 
fallen 
gave 
a 
ringing 
creak 
and 
he 
heard
the 
voice 
of 
an 
old 
maidservant 
saying, 
"Straight, 
straight, 
along 
the
path, 
Miss. 
Only, 
don't 
look 
back."

"I 
am 
not 
afraid," 
answered 
Sonya's 
voice, 
and 
along 
the 
path
toward 
Nicholas 
came 
the 
crunching, 
whistling 
sound 
of 
Sonya's 
feet
in 
her 
thin 
shoes.

Sonya 
came 
along, 
wrapped 
in 
her 
cloak. 
She 
was 
only 
a 
couple 
of 
paces
away 
when 
she 
saw 
him, 
and 
to 
her 
too 
he 
was 
not 
the 
Nicholas 
she 
had
known 
and 
always 
slightly 
feared. 
He 
was 
in 
a 
woman's 
dress, 
with
tousled 
hair 
and 
a 
happy<p>
smile 
new 
to 
Sonya. 
She 
ran 
rapidly 
toward
him.

"Quite 
different 
and 
yet 
the 
same," 
thought 
Nicholas, 
looking 
at 
her
face 
all 
lit 
up 
by 
the 
moonlight. 
He 
slipped 
his 
arms 
under 
the 
cloak
that 
covered 
her 
head, 
embraced 
her, 
pressed 
her 
to 
him, 
and 
kissed 
her
on 
the 
lips 
that 
wore 
a 
mustache 
and 
had 
a 
smell 
of 
burnt 
cork. 
Sonya
kissed 
him 
full 
on 
the 
lips, 
and 
disengaging 
her 
little 
hands 
pressed
them 
to 
his 
cheeks.

"Sonya!... 
Nicholas!"... 
was 
all 
they 
said. 
They 
ran 
to 
the 
barn
and 
then 
back 
again, 
re-entering, 
he 
by 
the 
front 
and 
she 
by 
the 
back
porch.





CHAPTER 
XII

When 
they 
all 
drove 
back 
from 
Pelageya 
Danilovna's, 
Natasha, 
who
always 
saw 
and 
noticed 
everything, 
arranged 
that 
she 
and 
Madame 
Schoss
should 
go 
back 
in 
the 
sleigh 
with 
Dimmler, 
and 
Sonya 
with 
Nicholas 
and
the 
maids.

On 
the 
way 
back 
Nicholas 
drove 
at 
a 
steady 
pace 
instead 
of 
racing 
and
kept 
peering 
by 
that 
fantastic 
all-transforming 
light 
into 
Sonya's
face 
and 
searching 
beneath 
the 
eyebrows 
and 
mustache 
for 
his 
former 
and
his 
present 
Sonya 
from 
whom 
he 
had 
resolved 
never<p>
to 
be 
parted 
again.
He 
looked 
and 
recognizing 
in<p>
her 
both 
the 
old 
and 
the 
new 
Sonya, 
and
being 
reminded 
by 
the 
smell 
of 
burnt 
cork 
of 
the 
sensation 
of 
her 
kiss,
inhaled 
the 
frosty 
air 
with 
a 
full 
breast 
and, 
looking 
at 
the 
ground
flying 
beneath 
him 
and 
at<p>
the 
sparkling 
sky, 
felt 
himself 
again 
in
fairyland.

"Sonya, 
is 
it 
well 
with 
thee?" 
he 
asked 
from 
time 
to 
time.

"Yes!" 
she 
replied. 
"And<p>
with 
thee?"

When 
halfway 
home 
Nicholas 
handed 
the 
reins 
to 
the 
coachman 
and 
ran 
for
a 
moment 
to 
Natasha's 
sleigh 
and 
stood 
on 
its 
wing.

"Natasha!" 
he 
whispered 
in 
French, 
"do 
you 
know 
I 
have 
made 
up 
my
mind 
about 
Sonya?"

"Have 
you 
told 
her?" 
asked 
Natasha, 
suddenly 
beaming 
all 
over 
with
joy.

"Oh, 
how 
strange 
you 
are 
with 
that 
mustache 
and 
those 
eyebrows!...
Natasha-are 
you 
glad?"

"I 
am 
so 
glad, 
so 
glad! 
I 
was 
beginning 
to 
be 
vexed 
with 
you. 
I 
did
not 
tell 
you, 
but 
you 
have 
been 
treating 
her 
badly. 
What 
a 
heart 
she
has,<p>
Nicholas! 
I 
am 
horrid 
sometimes, 
but 
I 
was 
ashamed 
to 
be 
happy
while 
Sonya 
was 
not," 
continued 
Natasha. 
"Now 
I 
am 
so 
glad! 
Well,
run 
back 
to 
her."

"No, 
wait 
a 
bit.... 
Oh, 
how 
funny 
you 
look!" 
cried 
Nicholas, 
peering
into 
her 
face
