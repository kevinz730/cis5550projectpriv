"May

said 
he 
respectfully, 
but 
with
a 
shade 
of 
contempt 
for 
the 
youthfulness 
of 
this 
officer 
and 
with 
a 
hand
thrust 
into 
his

"My

He 
pointed 
to
the 
two 
peasants 
who 
kept 
as 
close 
to 
him 
as 
horseflies 
to 
a 
horse.

"Ah!...

Grand! 
Forgive

said 
the 
peasants, 
smiling 
joyfully 
at 
him.

Rostov 
looked 
at 
the 
tipsy 
peasants 
and 
smiled.

"Or

with 
a 
staid 
air,
as 
he 
pointed 
at 
the

men 
with 
his 
free 
hand.

"No, 
there's 
not

said 
Rostov,<p>

rode 
on

"What's

he 
asked.
