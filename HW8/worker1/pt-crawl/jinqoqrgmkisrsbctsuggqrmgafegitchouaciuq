And 
having</h1>put 
him 
on 
his 
honor 
not 
to 
repeat 
anything 
she 
told 
him,
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
informed 
him 
that 
Natasha 
had 
refused 
Prince 
Andrew
without 
her 
parents' 
knowledge 
and 
that 
the 
cause 
of 
<a href="/aVzUge/NRO377NPl.html">this</a> 
was 
Anatole
Kuragin 
into 
whose 
society 
Pierre's 
wife 
had 
thrown 
her 
and 
with 
whom
Natasha 
had 
tried 
to 
elope 
during 
her 
father's 
absence, 
in 
order 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NA3Y0SvPHp0xkvA.html">to</a> 
be
married 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vo2Yvhw0Bxt4.html">secretly.

Pierre</a> 
raised 
his 
shoulders 
and 
listened 
open-mouthed 
to 
what 
was 
told
him, 
scarcely 
able 
to 
believe 
his 
own 
ears. 
That 
Prince 
Andrew's
deeply 
loved 
affianced 
wife-the 
same 
Natasha 
Rostova 
who 
used 
to 
be 
so
charming-should 
give 
up 
Bolkonski 
for 
that 
fool 
Anatole 
who 
was 
already
secretly 
married 
(as 
Pierre 
knew), 
and 
should 
be 
so 
in 
love 
with 
him 
as
to 
agree 
to 
run 
away 
with 
him, 
was 
something 
Pierre 
could 
not 
conceive
and 
could 
not 
imagine.

He 
could 
not 
reconcile 
the 
charming 
impression 
he 
had 
of 
Natasha, 
whom
he 
had 
known 
from 
a 
child, 
with 
this 
new 
conception 
of 
her 
baseness,
folly, 
and 
cruelty. 
He 
thought 
of 
his 
wife. 
"They 
are 
all 
alike!" 
he
said 
to 
himself, 
reflecting 
that 
he 
was 
not 
the 
only 
man 
unfortunate
enough 
to 
be 
tied 
to 
a 
bad 
woman. 
But 
still 
he 
pitied 
Prince 
Andrew 
to
the 
point 
of 
tears 
and 
sympathized 
with 
his 
wounded 
pride, 
and 
the 
more
he 
pitied 
his 
friend 
the 
more 
did 
he 
think 
with 
contempt 
and 
even 
with
disgust 
of 
that 
Natasha 
who 
had 
just 
passed 
him 
in 
the 
ballroom 
with
such 
a 
look 
of 
cold 
dignity. 
He 
did 
not 
know 
that 
Natasha's 
soul 
was
overflowing 
with 
despair, 
shame, 
and 
humiliation, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
not
her 
fault 
that 
her 
face 
happened 
to 
assume 
an 
expression 
of 
calm 
dignity
and 
severity.

"But 
how 
get 
married?" 
said 
Pierre, 
in 
answer<p>
to 
Marya 
Dmitrievna. 
"He
could 
not 
marry-he 
is 
married!"

"Things 
get 
worse 
from 
hour 
to 
hour!" 
ejaculated 
Marya 
Dmitrievna. 
"A
nice 
youth! 
What 
a 
scoundrel! 
And<p>
she's 
expecting 
him-expecting 
him
since 
yesterday. 
She 
must 
be 
told! 
Then 
at 
least 
she 
won't 
go 
on
expecting 
him."

After 
hearing 
the 
details 
of 
Anatole's 
marriage 
from 
Pierre, 
and 
giving
vent 
to 
her 
anger 
against 
Anatole 
in 
words 
of 
abuse, 
Marya 
Dmitrievna
told<p>
Pierre 
why 
she 
had 
sent 
for 
him. 
She 
was 
afraid 
that 
the 
count 
or
Bolkonski, 
who 
might 
arrive 
at 
any 
moment, 
if 
they 
knew 
of 
this 
affair
(which 
she 
hoped 
to 
hide 
from 
them) 
might 
challenge 
Anatole 
to 
a 
duel,
and 
she 
therefore 
asked 
Pierre 
to 
tell 
his 
brother-in-law 
in 
her 
name 
to
leave 
Moscow 
and 
not 
dare 
to 
let 
her 
set 
eyes 
on 
him 
again. 
Pierre-only
now 
realizing 
the 
danger 
to 
the 
old 
count, 
Nicholas, 
and 
Prince
Andrew-promised 
to 
do 
as 
she 
wished. 
Having 
briefly 
and 
exactly
explained 
her 
wishes
