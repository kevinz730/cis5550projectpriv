feet 
were 
bare.

Pierre 
first 
looked 
down 
the 
field 
across 
which 
vehicles 
and 
horsemen
were 
passing 
that 
morning, 
then 
into 
the 
distance 
across 
the 
river, 
then
at 
the 
dog 
who 
was 
pretending 
to 
be 
in 
earnest 
about 
biting 
him,
and 
then 
at 
his 
bare 
feet 
which 
he 
placed 
with 
pleasure 
in 
various
positions, 
moving 
his 
dirty 
thick 
big 
toes. 
Every 
time 
he 
looked 
at 
his
bare 
feet 
a 
smile 
of 
animated 
self-satisfaction 
flitted 
across 
his 
face.
The 
sight 
of 
them 
reminded 
him 
of 
all 
he 
had 
experienced 
and 
learned
during 
these 
weeks 
and 
this 
recollection 
was 
pleasant 
to 
him.

For 
some 
days 
the 
weather 
had 
been 
calm 
and 
clear 
with 
slight 
frosts 
in
the 
mornings-what 
is 
called 
an 
"old 
wives' 
summer."

In 
the 
sunshine 
the 
air 
was 
warm, 
and 
that 
warmth 
<a href="/cZl/FvO6hai1bvg.html">was</a> 
particularly
pleasant 
with 
the 
invigorating 
freshness 
of 
the 
morning 
frost 
still 
in
the 
air.

On 
everything-far 
and 
near-lay 
the 
magic 
crystal 
glitter 
seen 
only 
at
that 
time 
of 
autumn. 
The 
Sparrow 
Hills 
were 
visible 
in 
the 
distance,
with 
the 
village, 
the 
church, 
and 
the 
large 
white 
house. 
The 
bare 
trees,
the 
sand, 
<a href="/cZl/Ig25jM2Ro.html">the</a> 
bricks 
and 
roofs 
of 
the 
houses, 
the 
green 
church 
spire,
and 
the 
corners 
of 
the 
white 
house 
in 
the 
distance, 
all 
stood 
out 
in 
the
transparent 
air 
in 
most 
delicate 
outline 
and 
with 
unnatural 
clearness.
Near 
by 
could 
be 
seen 
the 
familiar 
<a href="/cZl/wd1STxex5XQ7EnBVm.html">ruins</a> 
of 
a 
half-burned 
mansion
occupied 
by 
the 
French,<p>
with 
lilac 
bushes 
still 
showing 
dark 
green
beside 
the 
fence. 
And 
even 
that 
ruined 
and 
befouled 
<a href="/aVzUge/re5CyE9Im7bOIDr.html">house-which</a> 
in 
dull
weather 
was 
repulsively 
ugly-seemed 
quietly 
beautiful
