he
added.

"However, 
you're 
sleepy, 
and 
it's 
time 
for 
me 
to 
sleep. 
Go 
back 
to
Gorki!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
suddenly.

"Oh 
no!" 
Pierre 
replied, 
looking 
at 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
frightened,
compassionate 
eyes.

"Go, 
go! 
Before 
a 
battle 
one 
must 
have 
one's 
sleep<p>
out," 
repeated 
Prince
Andrew.

He 
came 
quickly 
up 
to 
Pierre 
and 
embraced 
and 
kissed 
him. 
"Good-by, 
be
off!" 
he 
shouted. 
"Whether 
we 
meet 
again 
or 
not..." 
and 
turning 
away
hurriedly 
he 
entered 
the 
shed.

It 
was 
already 
dark, 
and 
Pierre 
could 
not 
make<p>
out 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/LN8bju0.html">whether</a> 
the
expression 
of 
Prince 
Andrew's 
face 
was 
angry 
or 
tender.

For 
some 
time 
he 
stood 
in 
silence 
considering 
whether 
he 
should 
follow
him 
or 
go 
away. 
"No, 
he 
does 
not 
want 
it!" 
Pierre 
concluded. 
"And 
I 
know
that 
this 
is 
our 
last 
meeting!" 
He 
sighed 
deeply 
and 
rode 
back 
to 
Gorki.

On 
re-entering 
the 
shed 
Prince 
Andrew 
lay 
down 
on 
a 
rug, 
but 
he 
could
not 
sleep.

He 
closed 
his 
eyes. 
One 
picture 
succeeded 
another 
in 
his 
imagination. 
On
one 
of 
them 
he 
dwelt 
long 
and 
joyfully. 
He 
vividly 
recalled 
an 
evening
in 
Petersburg. 
<a href="/aVzUge/Gj8N5o1jbFN.html">Natasha</a> 
with 
animated 
and 
excited 
face 
was 
telling 
him
how 
she 
had<p>
gone 
to 
look 
for 
mushrooms 
the 
previous 
summer 
and 
had 
lost
her 
way 
in 
the 
big 
forest. 
She 
incoherently 
described 
the 
depths 
of
the 
forest, 
her 
feelings, 
and 
a 
talk 
with 
a 
beekeeper 
she 
met, 
and
constantly 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ak7z7iY0e.html">interrupted</a> 
her 
story 
to 
say: 
"No, 
I 
can't! 
I'm 
not 
telling
it 
right; 
no, 
you 
don't 
understand," 
though 
he 
encouraged 
her 
by 
saying
that 
he 
did 
understand, 
and 
he 
really 
had 
understood 
all 
she 
wanted 
to
say. 
But 
Natasha 
was 
not 
satisfied 
with 
her 
own 
words: 
she 
felt 
that
they 
did 
not 
convey 
the 
passionately 
poetic 
feeling 
she 
had 
experienced
that 
day 
and 
wished 
to 
convey. 
"He 
was 
such 
a 
delightful 
old 
man, 
and
it 
was 
so 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Hr21HI7.html">dark</a> 
in 
the 
forest... 
and 
he 
had 
such 
kind... 
No, 
I 
can't
describe 
it," 
she 
had 
said, 
flushed 
and 
excited. 
Prince 
Andrew 
smiled
now 
the 
same 
happy 
smile 
as 
then 
when 
he 
had<p>
looked 
into 
her 
eyes. 
"I
understood 
her," 
he 
thought. 
"I 
not 
only 
understood 
her, 
but 
it 
was 
just
that 
inner, 
spiritual 
force, 
that 
sincerity, 
that 
frankness 
of 
soul-that
very 
soul 
of 
hers 
which 
seemed 
to 
be 
fettered 
by 
her 
body-it 
was 
that
soul 
I 
loved 
in 
her... 
loved 
so 
strongly 
and 
happily..." 
and 
suddenly
he 
remembered 
how 
his 
love 
had 
ended. 
"He 
did 
not 
need 
anything 
of 
that
kind. 
He 
neither 
saw 
nor 
understood 
anything 
of 
the 
sort. 
He 
only 
saw 
in
her 
a 
pretty 
and 
fresh 
young 
girl, 
with 
whom 
he 
did 
not 
deign 
to 
unite
his 
fate. 
And 
I?... 
and 
he 
is 
still 
alive 
and 
gay!"

Prince 
Andrew 
jumped 
up 
as 
if 
someone 
had 
burned 
him, 
and 
again 
began
pacing 
up 
and 
down 
in 
front 
of 
the 
shed.





CHAPTER 
XXVI

On 
August 
25, 
the 
eve 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino, 
M. 
de 
Beausset, 
prefect
of 
the 
French 
Emperor's 
palace, 
arrived 
at 
Napoleon's 
quarters 
at
Valuevo 
with 
Colonel 
Fabvier, 
the 
former 
from 
Paris 
and 
the 
latter 
from
Madrid.

Donning 
his 
court 
uniform, 
M. 
de 
Beausset 
ordered 
a 
box 
he 
had
brought 
for 
the 
Emperor 
to 
be 
carried 
before 
him 
and 
entered 
the 
first
compartment 
of 
Napoleon's 
tent, 
where 
he 
began 
opening 
the 
box 
while
conversing 
with 
Napoleon's 
aides-de-camp 
who 
surrounded 
him.

Fabvier, 
not 
entering 
the 
tent, 
remained 
at 
the 
entrance 
talking 
to 
some
generals 
of 
his 
acquaintance.

The 
Emperor 
Napoleon 
had 
not 
yet 
left 
his 
bedroom 
and 
was 
finishing 
his
toilet. 
Slightly 
snorting 
and 
grunting, 
he 
presented 
now 
his 
back 
and
now 
his 
plump 
hairy 
chest 
to 
the 
brush 
with 
which 
his 
valet 
was 
rubbing
him 
down. 
Another 
valet, 
with 
his 
finger 
over
