you?"</h1>he 
asked.

"One 
moment, 
one 
moment!" 
replied 
the 
adjutant, 
and 
riding 
up 
to 
a 
stout
colonel 
who 
was 
standing 
in 
the 
meadow, 
he 
gave 
him 
some 
message 
and
then 
addressed 
Pierre.

"Why 
have 
you 
come 
here, 
Count?" 
he 
asked 
with 
a 
smile. 
"Still
inquisitive?"

"Yes, 
yes," 
assented 
Pierre.

But 
the 
adjutant 
turned 
his 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bF8Ro21viB.html">horse</a> 
about 
and 
rode 
on.

"Here 
it's 
tolerable," 
said 
he, 
"but 
with 
Bagration 
on 
the 
left 
flank
they're 
getting 
it 
frightfully 
hot."

"Really?" 
said 
Pierre. 
"Where 
is 
that?"

"Come 
along 
with 
me 
to 
our 
knoll. 
We 
can 
get 
a 
view<p>
from 
there 
and 
in
our 
battery 
it 
is 
still 
bearable," 
<a href="/aVzUge/vbc998KpkPN.html">said</a> 
the 
adjutant. 
"Will 
you 
come?"

"Yes, 
I'll 
come 
with 
you," 
replied 
Pierre, 
looking 
round 
for 
his 
groom.

It 
was 
only 
now 
that 
he 
noticed 
wounded 
men 
staggering 
along 
or 
being
carried 
on 
stretchers. 
On 
that 
very 
meadow 
he 
had 
ridden 
over 
the 
day
before, 
a 
soldier 
was 
lying 
athwart 
the 
rows 
of 
scented 
hay, 
<a href="/cZl/AC87o7XKBx.html">with</a> 
his
head 
thrown 
awkwardly 
back 
and 
his 
shako 
off.

"Why 
haven't 
they 
carried 
him 
away?" 
Pierre 
was 
about 
to 
ask, 
but 
seeing
the 
stern 
expression 
of 
the 
adjutant 
who 
was 
also 
looking 
that 
way, 
he
checked 
himself.

Pierre 
did 
not 
find 
his 
groom 
and 
rode 
along 
the 
hollow 
with 
the
adjutant 
to 
Raevski's 
Redoubt. 
His 
horse 
lagged 
behind 
the 
adjutant's
and 
jolted 
him 
at 
every 
step.

"You 
don't 
seem 
to 
be 
used 
to 
riding, 
Count?" 
remarked 
the 
adjutant.

"No 
it's 
not 
that, 
but 
her 
action 
seems 
so<p>
jerky," 
said 
Pierre 
in 
a
puzzled 
tone.

"Why... 
she's 
wounded!" 
said 
the 
adjutant. 
"In 
the 
off 
foreleg 
above 
the
knee. 
A 
bullet, 
no 
doubt. 
I 
congratulate 
you, 
Count, 
on 
your 
baptism 
of
fire!"

Having 
ridden 
in 
the 
smoke 
past 
the 
Sixth 
Corps, 
behind 
the 
artillery
which 
had 
been 
moved 
forward 
and 
was 
in 
action, 
deafening 
them 
with 
the
noise 
of 
firing, 
they 
came 
to 
a 
small 
wood. 
There 
it 
was 
cool 
and 
quiet,
with 
a 
scent 
of 
autumn. 
Pierre 
and 
the 
adjutant 
dismounted 
and 
walked 
up
the 
hill 
on 
foot.

"Is 
<a href="/cZl/tE3iLv7to9sVlKw.html">the</a> 
general 
here?" 
asked 
the 
adjutant 
on 
reaching 
the 
knoll.

"He 
was 
here 
a 
minute 
ago 
but 
has 
just 
gone 
that 
way," 
someone 
told 
him,
pointing 
to 
the 
right.

The 
adjutant 
looked 
at 
Pierre 
as 
if 
puzzled 
what 
to 
do 
with 
him 
now.

"Don't 
trouble 
about 
me," 
said 
Pierre. 
"I'll 
go 
up 
onto 
the 
knoll 
if 
I
may?"

"Yes, 
do. 
You'll 
see 
everything 
from 
there 
and 
it's 
less 
dangerous, 
and
I'll 
come 
for 
you."

Pierre 
went<p>
to 
the 
battery 
and 
the 
adjutant 
rode 
on. 
They 
did 
not 
meet
again, 
and 
only 
much 
later 
did 
Pierre 
learn 
that 
he 
lost 
an 
arm 
that
day.

The 
knoll 
to 
which 
Pierre 
ascended 
was 
that 
famous 
one 
afterwards 
known
to 
the 
Russians 
as 
the 
Knoll 
Battery 
or 
Raevski's 
Redoubt,<p>
and 
to 
the
French 
as 
la 
grande 
redoute, 
la 
fatale 
redoute, 
la 
redoute 
du 
centre,
around 
which 
tens 
of 
thousands 
fell, 
and<p>
which 
the 
French 
regarded 
as
the 
key 
to 
the 
whole 
position.

This 
redoubt 
consisted 
of 
a 
knoll, 
on 
three 
sides 
of 
which 
trenches 
had
been 
dug. 
Within 
the 
entrenchment 
stood 
ten 
guns 
that 
were 
being 
fired
through 
openings 
in 
the 
earthwork.

In 
line 
with 
the 
knoll 
on 
both 
sides 
stood 
other 
guns 
which 
also 
fired
incessantly. 
A 
little 
behind 
the 
guns 
stood 
infantry. 
When 
ascending
that 
knoll 
Pierre 
had 
no 
notion 
that 
this 
spot, 
on 
which 
small 
trenches
had 
been 
dug 
and 
from 
which 
a 
few 
guns 
were 
firing, 
was 
the 
most
important 
point 
of 
the 
battle.

On 
the 
contrary, 
just 
because 
he 
happened 
to 
be 
there 
he 
thought 
it
