He 
looked 
at</h1>the 
countess,
and 
seeing 
her 
severe 
face 
said: 
"Well, 
good-by, 
Countess," 
and
kissing 
her 
hand, 
he 
left 
the 
room 
with 
quick 
resolute 
strides, 
without
looking 
at 
Natasha.


Next 
day 
Rostov 
saw 
Denisov 
off. 
He 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
stay 
another
day 
in 
Moscow. 
All 
Denisov's 
Moscow 
friends<p>
gave 
him 
a 
farewell
entertainment 
at 
the 
gypsies', 
with 
the 
result 
that 
he 
had 
no
recollection 
of 
how 
he 
was 
put

the 
sleigh 
or

the 
first<p>

Denisov's 
departure, 
Rostov 
spent 
another 
fortnight 
in 
Moscow,
without 
going 
out 
of 
the 
house, 
waiting 
for 
the 
money 
his 
father 
could
not 
at 
once 
raise, 
and 
he 
spent 
most 
of 
his 
time 
in 
the 
girls' 
room.

Sonya 
was 
more 
tender 
and 
devoted 
to 
him 
than 
ever. 
It 
was 
as 
if 
she
wanted 
to 
show 
him 
that 
his 
losses 
were 
an 
achievement 
that 
made 
her
love 
him 
all 
the 
more, 
but 
Nicholas 
now 
considered 
himself 
unworthy 
of
her.

He 
filled 
the 
girls' 
albums 
with 
verses 
and 
music,
