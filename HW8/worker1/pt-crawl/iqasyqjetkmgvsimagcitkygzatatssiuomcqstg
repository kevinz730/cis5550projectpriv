box 
for 
<a href="/cZl/Gt84qEo4.html">the</a>

<a href="/cZl/Ym306CpNdk.html">of</a> 
the 
performance, 
and 
Natasha 
moved 
over 
to
it.

The 
scene 
of 
the 
third 
act 
represented 
a 
palace 
in 
which 
many 
candles
were 
burning 
and 
pictures 
of 
knights 
with 
short 
beards 
hung 
on 
the
walls. 
In 
the 
middle 
stood 
what 
were 
probably 
a 
king 
and 
a 
queen. 
The
king 
waved 
his 
right 
arm 
and, 
evidently<p>
nervous, 
sang 
something 
badly
and 
sat 
down 
on 
a 
crimson 
throne. 
The 
maiden 
who 
had 
been 
first 
in 
white
and 
then 
in 
light 
blue, 
now 
wore 
only 
a 
smock, 
and 
stood 
beside 
the
throne 
with 
her 
hair 
down. 
She 
sang 
something 
mournfully, 
addressing 
the
queen, 
but 
the 
king 
waved 
his 
arm 
severely, 
and 
men 
and 
women 
with 
bare
legs 
came 
in 
from 
both 
sides 
and 
began 
dancing 
all 
together. 
Then 
the
violins 
played 
very 
shrilly 
and 
merrily 
and 
one 
of 
the 
women 
with 
thick
bare 
legs 
and 
thin 
arms, 
separating 
from 
the 
others, 
went 
behind 
the
wings, 
adjusted 
her 
bodice, 
returned 
to 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
stage, 
and
began<p>
jumping 
and 
striking 
one 
foot 
rapidly 
against 
the 
other. 
In 
the
stalls 
everyone 
clapped 
and 
shouted 
"bravo!" 
Then 
one 
of 
the 
men
went 
into 
a 
corner 
of 
the 
stage. 
The 
cymbals 
and 
horns 
in 
the 
orchestra
struck 
up 
more 
loudly, 
and 
this 
man 
with 
bare 
legs 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/WU8DbPtL3As.html">jumped</a> 
very 
high 
and
waved 
his 
feet 
about 
very 
rapidly. 
(He 
was 
Duport, 
who 
received 
sixty
thousand 
rubles 
a 
year 
for 
this 
art.) 
Everybody 
in 
the 
stalls, 
boxes,
and 
galleries 
began 
clapping 
and 
shouting 
with 
all 
their 
might, 
and 
the
man 
stopped 
and 
began 
smiling 
and 
bowing 
to 
all 
sides.<p>
Then 
other 
men
and 
women 
danced 
with 
bare 
legs. 
Then 
the 
king 
again 
shouted 
to 
the
sound 
<a href="/aVzUge/Og9w11xhL.html">of</a> 
music, 
and 
they 
all 
began 
singing. 
But 
suddenly 
a 
storm
came 
on, 
chromatic 
scales 
and 
diminished 
sevenths 
were 
heard 
in 
the
orchestra, 
everyone 
ran 
off, 
again 
dragging 
one 
of 
their 
number 
away,
and 
the 
curtain 
dropped. 
Once 
more 
there 
was 
a 
terrible 
noise 
and
clatter 
among 
the 
audience, 
and 
with 
rapturous 
faces 
everyone 
began
shouting: 
"Duport! 
Duport! 
Duport!" 
Natasha 
no 
longer 
thought 
this
strange. 
She 
looked 
about 
with 
pleasure, 
smiling 
joyfully.

"Isn't 
Duport 
delightful?" 
Helene 
asked 
her.

"Oh, 
yes," 
replied 
Natasha.





CHAPTER 
X

During 
the 
entr'acte 
a 
whiff 
of 
cold 
air 
came 
into 
Helene's 
box,
the 
door 
opened, 
and 
Anatole 
entered, 
stooping 
and 
trying 
not 
to 
brush
against 
anyone.

"Let 
me 
introduce 
my 
brother 
to 
you," 
said 
Helene, 
her 
eyes
shifting<p>
uneasily 
from 
Natasha 
to 
Anatole.

Natasha 
turned 
her 
pretty 
little 
head 
toward 
the 
elegant 
young 
officer
and 
smiled 
at 
him 
over 
her 
bare 
shoulder. 
Anatole, 
who 
was 
as 
handsome
at 
close 
quarters 
as 
at 
a 
distance, 
sat<p>
down 
beside 
her 
and 
told 
her 
he
had 
long 
wished 
to 
have 
this 
happiness-ever 
since 
the 
Naryshkins'
ball 
in 
fact, 
at 
which 
he 
had 
had 
the 
well-remembered 
pleasure 
of 
seeing
her. 
Kuragin 
was 
much 
more 
sensible 
and 
simple 
with 
women 
than 
among
men. 
He 
talked 
boldly 
and 
naturally, 
and 
Natasha 
was 
strangely 
and
agreeably 
struck 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
was 
nothing 
formidable 
in 
this
man 
about 
whom 
there 
was 
so 
much 
talk, 
but 
that 
on 
the 
contrary 
his
smile 
was 
most 
naive, 
cheerful, 
and 
good-natured.

Kuragin 
asked 
her 
opinion 
of 
the 
performance 
and 
told 
her 
how 
at 
a
previous 
performance 
Semenova 
had 
fallen 
down 
on 
the 
stage.

"And 
do 
you 
know, 
Countess," 
he 
said, 
suddenly 
addressing 
her 
as 
an
old, 
familiar 
acquaintance, 
"we 
are 
getting 
up 
a 
costume 
tournament;
you 
ought 
to 
take 
part 
in 
it! 
It 
will 
be 
great 
fun. 
We 
shall 
all 
meet 
at
the 
Karagins'! 
Please 
come! 
No! 
Really, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rg15uFRs2Qc.html">eh?"</a> 
said 
he.

While 
saying 
this 
he 
never 
removed 
his 
smiling 
eyes 
from 
her 
face,
her 
neck, 
and 
her 
bare 
arms. 
Natasha 
knew 
for 
certain 
that 
he 
was
enraptured 
by 
her. 
This 
pleased 
her, 
yet 
his 
presence 
made 
her 
feel
constrained 
and 
oppressed. 
When 
she 
was 
not 
looking 
at 
him 
she 
felt 
that
he 
was 
looking 
at 
her 
shoulders, 
and 
she 
involuntarily 
caught 
his 
eye
