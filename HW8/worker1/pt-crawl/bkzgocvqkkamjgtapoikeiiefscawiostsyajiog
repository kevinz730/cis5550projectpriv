"Sophie," 
he 
began, 
<a href="/aVzUge/Tk8Ll5rJpLp9d.html">timidly</a> 
at<p>
first 
and 
then 
more 
and 
more
boldly, 
"if 
you 
wish 
to 
refuse 
one 
who 
is 
not 
only 
a 
brilliant 
and
advantageous 
match 
but 
a 
splendid, 
noble 
fellow... 
he 
is 
my 
friend..."

Sonya 
interrupted 
him.

"I 
have 
already 
refused," 
she 
said 
hurriedly.

"If 
you 
are 
refusing 
for 
my 
sake, 
I 
am 
afraid 
that 
I..."

Sonya 
again 
interrupted. 
She 
gave 
him 
an 
imploring, 
frightened 
look.

"Nicholas, 
don't 
tell 
me 
that!" 
she 
said.

"No, 
<a href="/cZl/DU5e23A.html">but</a> 
I 
must. 
It 
may 
be 
arrogant 
of 
me, 
but 
still 
it 
is 
best 
to 
say
it. 
If 
you 
refuse 
him 
on 
my<p>
account, 
I 
must 
tell 
you 
the 
whole 
truth. 
I
love 
you, 
and 
I 
think 
I 
love 
you 
more 
<a href="/cZl/tQp9Yvhw6iOfK3lFuWA.html">than</a> 
anyone 
else...."

"That 
is 
enough 
for 
me," 
said 
Sonya, 
blushing.

"No, 
but 
I 
have 
been 
in 
love 
a 
thousand 
times 
and 
shall 
fall 
in
love 
again, 
though 
for<p>
no 
one 
have 
I 
such 
a 
feeling 
of 
friendship,
confidence, 
and 
love 
as 
I 
have 
for 
you. 
Then 
I 
am 
young. 
Mamma 
does
not 
wish 
it. 
In 
a 
word, 
I 
make 
no 
promise.<p>
And 
I 
beg 
you 
to 
consider
Dolokhov's 
offer," 
he 
said, 
articulating 
his 
friend's 
name 
with
difficulty.

"Don't 
say 
that 
to 
me! 
I 
want 
nothing. 
I 
love 
you 
as 
a 
brother 
and
always 
shall, 
and 
I 
want 
<a href="/cZl/QY1WlHf6jM4JdRQ.html">nothing</a> 
more."

"You 
are 
an 
angel: 
I 
am 
not 
worthy 
of 
you, 
but 
I 
am 
afraid 
of
misleading 
you."

And 
Nicholas 
again 
kissed 
her 
hand.





CHAPTER 
XII

Iogel's 
were 
the 
most 
enjoyable 
balls 
in 
Moscow. 
So 
said 
the 
mothers
as 
they 
watched 
their 
young 
people 
executing 
their 
newly 
learned 
steps,
and 
so 
said 
the 
youths 
and 
maidens 
themselves 
as 
they 
danced 
till 
they
were 
ready 
to 
drop, 
and 
so 
said 
the 
grown-up 
young 
men 
and 
women 
who
came 
to 
these 
balls 
with 
an 
air 
of 
condescension 
and 
found 
them 
most
enjoyable. 
That 
year 
two 
marriages 
had 
come 
of 
these 
balls. 
The 
<a href="/cZl/CW1H0D5ZhuM.html">two
pretty</a> 
young 
Princesses 
Gorchakov 
met 
suitors 
there 
and 
were 
married
and 
so 
further 
increased 
the 
fame 
of 
these 
dances. 
What 
distinguished
them 
from 
others 
was 
the 
absence 
of 
host 
or 
hostess 
and 
the 
presence 
of
the 
good-natured 
Iogel, 
flying 
about 
like 
a 
feather 
and 
bowing 
according
to 
the 
rules
