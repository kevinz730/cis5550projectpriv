All
her</h1>powers 
since 
morning 
had 
been 
concentrated 
on 
ensuring 
that 
they
all-she 
herself, 
Mamma, 
and 
Sonya-should 
be 
as 
well 
dressed 
as
possible. 
Sonya 
and 
her 
mother 
put 
themselves 
entirely 
in 
her 
hands.
The 
countess 
was 
to 
wear 
a 
claret-colored 
velvet 
dress, 
and 
the 
two
girls 
white 
gauze 
over 
pink 
silk 
slips, 
with 
roses 
on 
their 
bodices 
and
their 
hair 
dressed 
a 
la 
grecque.

Everything 
essential 
had 
already 
been 
done; 
feet, 
hands, 
necks, 
and
ears 
washed, 
perfumed, 
and 
powdered, 
as 
befits 
a 
ball; 
the 
openwork
silk 
stockings 
and 
white 
satin 
shoes 
with 
ribbons 
were 
already 
on; 
the
hairdressing 
was 
almost 
done. 
Sonya 
was 
finishing 
dressing 
and 
so 
was
the 
countess, 
but 
Natasha, 
who 
had 
bustled 
about 
helping 
them 
all, 
was
behindhand. 
She 
was 
still 
sitting 
before 
a 
looking-glass 
with 
a 
dressing
jacket 
thrown 
over 
her 
slender 
shoulders. 
Sonya 
stood 
ready 
dressed 
in
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room 
and, 
pressing 
the 
head 
of 
a 
pin 
till 
it 
hurt 
her
dainty 
finger, 
was 
fixing 
on 
a 
last 
ribbon 
that 
squeaked 
as 
the 
pin 
went
through 
it.

"That's 
not 
the 
way, 
that's 
not 
the 
way, 
Sonya!" 
cried 
Natasha
turning 
her 
head 
and 
clutching 
with 
both 
hands 
at 
her 
hair 
which 
the
maid 
who<p>
was 
dressing 
it 
had 
not 
time 
to 
release. 
"That 
bow 
is 
not
right. 
Come 
here!"

Sonya 
sat 
down 
and 
Natasha 
pinned 
the 
ribbon 
on 
differently.

"Allow 
me, 
Miss!<p>
I 
can't 
do 
it 
like 
that," 
said 
the 
maid 
who 
was
holding 
Natasha's 
hair.

"Oh, 
dear! 
Well 
then, 
wait. 
That's 
right, 
Sonya."

"Aren't 
you 
ready? 
It 
is 
nearly 
ten," 
came 
the 
countess' 
voice.

"Directly! 
Directly! 
And 
you,<p>
Mamma?"

"I 
have 
only 
my 
cap 
to 
pin 
on."

"Don't 
do 
it 
without 
me!" 
called 
Natasha. 
"You 
won't 
do 
it
right."

"But 
it's 
already 
ten."

They 
had 
decided 
to 
be 
at 
the 
ball 
by 
half-past 
ten, 
and 
Natasha 
had
still 
to 
get 
dressed 
and 
they 
had 
to 
call 
at 
the 
Taurida 
Gardens.

When 
her 
hair 
was 
done, 
Natasha, 
in 
her 
short 
petticoat 
from 
under
which 
her 
dancing 
shoes 
showed, 
and 
in 
her 
mother's 
dressing 
jacket,
ran 
<a href="/cZl/IN44oFuln0UGRY.html">up</a> 
to 
Sonya, 
scrutinized 
her, 
and 
then 
ran 
to 
her 
mother. 
Turning
her 
mother's 
head 
this 
way 
and 
that, 
she 
fastened 
on 
the 
cap 
and,
hurriedly 
kissing 
her 
gray 
hair, 
ran 
back 
to 
the 
maids 
who 
were 
turning
up 
the 
hem 
of 
her 
skirt.

The 
cause 
of 
the 
delay 
was 
Natasha's 
skirt, 
which 
was 
too 
long.
Two 
maids 
were 
turning 
up 
the 
hem 
and 
hurriedly 
biting 
off 
the 
ends 
of
thread. 
A<p>
third 
with 
pins 
in 
her 
mouth 
was 
running 
about 
between 
the
countess 
and 
Sonya, 
and 
a 
fourth 
held 
the 
whole 
of<p>
the 
gossamer 
garment
up 
high 
on 
one 
uplifted 
hand.

"Mavra, 
quicker, 
darling!"

"Give 
me 
my 
thimble, 
Miss, 
from 
there..."

"Whenever 
will 
you 
be 
ready?" 
asked 
the 
count 
coming 
to 
the<p>
door.
"Here 
is 
some 
scent. 
Peronskaya 
must 
be 
tired 
of 
waiting."

"It's 
ready, 
Miss," 
said 
the 
maid, 
holding 
up 
the 
shortened 
gauze
dress 
with 
two 
fingers,<p>
and 
blowing 
and 
shaking 
something 
off 
it, 
as 
if
by 
this 
to 
express 
a 
consciousness 
of 
the 
airiness 
and 
purity 
of 
what
she 
held.

Natasha 
began 
putting 
on 
the 
dress.

"In 
a 
minute! 
In 
a 
minute! 
Don't 
come 
in, 
Papa!" 
she 
cried 
to 
her
father 
as 
he<p>
opened 
the 
door-speaking 
from 
under 
the 
filmy 
skirt 
which
still 
covered 
her 
whole 
face.

Sonya 
slammed 
the 
door 
to. 
A 
minute 
later 
they 
let 
the 
count 
in. 
He 
was
wearing 
a 
blue 
swallow-tail 
coat, 
shoes 
and 
stockings, 
and 
was 
perfumed
and 
his 
hair 
pomaded.

"Oh, 
Papa! 
how 
nice 
you 
look! 
Charming!" 
cried 
Natasha, 
as 
she
stood 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room 
smoothing 
out 
the 
folds 
of 
the 
gauze.

"If 
you 
please, 
Miss! 
allow 
me," 
said 
the 
maid, 
who 
on 
her 
knees 
was
pulling 
the 
skirt 
straight 
and 
shifting 
the 
pins 
from 
one 
side 
of 
her
mouth 
to 
the 
other 
<a href="/aVzUge/Dt5rq4kplH7ioN.html">with</a> 
her 
tongue.

"Say 
what 
you 
like," 
exclaimed 
Sonya, 
in 
a 
despairing 
voice 
as 
she
looked 
at 
Natasha, 
"say 
what 
you 
like, 
it's 
still 
too 
long."

Natasha 
stepped 
back 
to 
look 
at 
herself
