he 
read</h1>that 
book: 
the 
joy, 
hitherto 
unknown 
to 
him,
of 
believing 
in 
the 
possibility 
of 
attaining 
perfection, 
and 
in 
the
possibility 
of 
active 
brotherly 
love 
among 
men, 
which 
Joseph 
Alexeevich
had 
revealed 
to 
him. 
A 
week 
after 
his 
arrival, 
the 
young 
Polish 
count,
Willarski, 
whom 
Pierre 
had 
known 
slightly 
in 
Petersburg 
society, 
came
into 
his 
room 
one 
evening 
in 
the 
official 
and 
ceremonious 
manner 
in
which 
Dolokhov's 
second 
had 
called 
on 
him, 
and, 
having 
closed 
the
door 
behind 
him 
and 
satisfied 
himself 
that 
there 
was 
nobody 
else 
in 
the
room, 
addressed 
Pierre.

"I 
have 
come 
to 
you 
with<p>
a 
message 
and 
an 
offer, 
Count," 
he
said 
without 
sitting 
down. 
"A 
person 
of 
very 
high 
standing 
in 
our
Brotherhood 
has 
made 
application 
for 
you 
to 
be 
received 
into 
our 
Order
before 
the 
usual 
term<p>
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/iw5i9vWPe0KqZP.html">and</a> 
has 
proposed 
to 
me 
to 
be 
your 
sponsor. 
I
consider 
it 
a 
sacred<p>
duty 
to 
fulfill 
that 
person's 
wishes. 
Do 
you 
wish
to 
enter 
the 
Brotherhood 
of 
Freemasons 
under 
my 
sponsorship?"

The 
cold, 
austere 
tone 
of 
this 
man, 
whom 
he 
had 
almost 
always 
before 
met
at 
balls, 
amiably 
smiling 
in 
the 
society 
of 
the 
most 
brilliant 
women,
surprised 
Pierre.

"Yes, 
I 
do 
wish 
it," 
said 
he.

Willarski 
bowed 
his 
head.

"One 
more 
question, 
Count," 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/VE6H1E2h.html">he</a> 
said, 
"which 
I 
beg 
you 
to 
answer
in 
all 
sincerity-not 
<a href="/cZl/Az6Scb1c8.html">as</a> 
a 
future 
Mason 
but 
as 
an 
honest 
man: 
have 
you
renounced 
your 
former 
convictions-do 
you 
believe 
in 
God?"

Pierre 
considered.

"Yes... 
yes, 
I 
believe 
in 
God," 
he 
said.

"In 
that 
case..." 
began 
Willarski, 
but 
Pierre 
interrupted 
him.

"Yes, 
I 
do 
believe 
in 
God," 
he 
repeated.

"In 
that 
case 
we 
can 
go," 
said 
Willarski.
