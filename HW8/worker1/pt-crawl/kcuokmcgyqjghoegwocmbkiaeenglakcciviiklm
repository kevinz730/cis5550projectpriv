that 
the 
general, 
whom 
he 
had 
greatly 
respected 
till
then, 
was 
a 
rubbishy 
German, 
that 
Denisov 
was 
a 
hero, 
the 
esaul 
a 
hero,
and 
Tikhon 
a 
hero<p>
too, 
and 
that 
it 
would 
be 
shameful 
for 
him 
to 
leave
them 
at 
a 
moment 
of 
difficulty.

It 
was 
already 
growing 
dusk 
when 
Denisov, 
Petya, 
and 
the 
esaul 
rode 
up
to 
the 
watchhouse. 
In 
the 
twilight 
saddled 
horses 
could 
be 
seen, 
and
Cossacks 
and 
hussars 
who 
had 
rigged 
up 
rough 
shelters 
in 
the 
glade 
and
were 
kindling 
glowing 
fires 
in 
a 
hollow 
<a href="/cZl/Xo4fU44vb.html">of</a> 
the 
forest 
where 
the 
French
could 
not 
see 
the 
smoke. 
In 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
small 
watchhouse 
a
Cossack 
with 
sleeves 
rolled 
up 
was 
chopping 
some 
mutton. 
In<p>
the 
room
three 
officers 
of 
Denisov's 
band 
were 
converting 
a 
door 
into 
a 
tabletop.
Petya 
took 
off 
his 
wet 
clothes, 
gave 
them 
to 
be 
dried, 
and 
at 
once 
began
helping 
the 
officers 
to 
fix 
up 
the 
dinner 
table.

In 
ten 
minutes 
the 
table 
was 
ready 
and 
a 
napkin 
spread 
on 
it. 
On 
the
table 
were 
vodka, 
a 
flask 
of 
rum, 
white 
bread, 
roast 
mutton, 
and 
salt.

Sitting 
at 
table 
with 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/If4vGX4Cr8.html">officers</a> 
and 
tearing 
the 
fat 
savory 
mutton
with 
his 
hands, 
down 
which 
the 
grease 
trickled, 
Petya 
was 
in 
an 
ecstatic
childish 
state 
of 
love 
for 
all 
men, 
and 
consequently 
of 
confidence 
that
others 
loved 
him 
in 
the 
same 
way.

"So 
then 
what 
do 
you 
think, 
Vasili 
Dmitrich?" 
said 
he 
to 
Denisov. 
"It's
all 
right 
my 
staying 
a 
day 
with 
you?" 
And 
not 
waiting 
for 
a 
reply 
he
answered 
his 
own 
question: 
"You 
see 
I 
was 
told 
to 
find 
out-well, 
I 
am
finding 
out.... 
Only 
do 
let 
me 
into 
the 
very... 
into 
the 
chief... 
I
don't 
want 
a 
reward.... 
But 
I 
want..."

Petya 
clenched 
his 
teeth 
and 
looked 
around, 
throwing 
back 
his 
head 
and
flourishing 
his 
arms.

"Into 
the 
vewy 
chief..." 
Denisov 
repeated 
with 
a 
smile.

"Only, 
please 
let 
me 
command 
something, 
so 
that 
I 
may 
really 
command..."
Petya 
went 
on. 
"What 
would 
it 
be 
to 
you?... 
Oh, 
you 
want 
<a href="/aVzUge/su85TkvQH0.html">a</a> 
knife?" 
he
said, 
turning 
to 
an 
officer 
who 
wished 
to 
cut 
himself 
a 
piece 
of 
mutton.

And 
he<p>
handed 
him 
his 
clasp 
knife. 
The 
officer 
admired 
it.

"Please 
keep 
it. 
I 
have 
several 
like 
it," 
said 
Petya, 
blushing.
"Heavens! 
I 
was 
quite 
forgetting!" 
he 
suddenly 
cried. 
"I 
have 
some
raisins, 
fine 
ones;
