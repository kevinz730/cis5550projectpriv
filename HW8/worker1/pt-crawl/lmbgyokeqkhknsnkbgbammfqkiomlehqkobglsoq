unexpectedly, 
<a href="/cZl/oq6v8rIdLP.html">and</a> 
then 
in 
a 
querulous
voice 
suddenly 
shrieked: 
"but 
if 
I 
hear 
that 
you<p>
have 
not 
behaved 
like
a 
son 
of 
Nicholas 
Bolkonski, 
I 
shall 
be 
ashamed!"

"You 
need 
not 
have 
said 
that 
to 
me, 
Father," 
said 
the 
son 
with 
a
smile.

The 
old 
man 
was 
silent.

"I 
also 
wanted 
to 
ask 
you," 
continued 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"if 
I'm
killed 
and 
if 
I 
have 
a 
son,<p>
do 
not 
let 
him 
be 
<a href="/cZl/jf4H02Npkec.html">taken</a> 
away

yesterday... 
let 
him 
grow 
up 
with 
you....

let 
the 
wife 
have 
him?" 
said 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Hr21HI7.html">the</a> 
old 
man, 
and 
laughed.

They 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mRO2tA4xLYdP0.html">stood</a> 
silent, 
facing 
one 
another. 
The 
old 
man's 
sharp 
eyes 
were
fixed 
straight 
on 
his 
son's. 
Something 
twitched 
in 
the 
lower 
part<p>
of
the 
old 
prince's 
face.

"We've 
said 
good-by. 
Go!" 
he 
suddenly 
shouted 
in 
a 
loud, 
angry
voice, 
opening 
his 
door.

"What 
is 
it? 
What?" 
asked 
both 
princesses 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/di6HV1ohMq7NSCk.html">when</a>
