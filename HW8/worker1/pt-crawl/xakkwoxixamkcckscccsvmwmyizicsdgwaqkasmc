reason 
found
it</h1>necessary 
to 
tell 
Natasha 
of 
Prince 
Andrew's 
wound 
and 
of 
his 
being
with 
their 
party. 
The 
countess 
had 
seldom 
been 
so 
angry 
with 
anyone 
as
she 
was 
with 
Sonya. 
Sonya 
had 
cried 
and 
begged 
to 
be 
forgiven 
and 
now,
as 
if 
trying 
to 
atone 
for 
her 
fault, 
paid 
unceasing 
attention 
to 
her
cousin.

"Look, 
Natasha, 
how 
dreadfully 
it 
is 
burning!" 
said 
she.

"What's 
burning?" 
asked 
Natasha. 
"Oh, 
yes, 
Moscow."

And 
as 
if<p>
in 
order 
not 
to 
offend 
Sonya 
and 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
her, 
she 
turned
her 
face 
to 
the 
window, 
looked 
out 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
it 
was 
evident
that 
she 
could 
not 
see 
anything, 
and 
again 
settled 
down 
in 
her<p>
former
attitude.

"But 
you 
didn't 
see 
it!"

"Yes, 
really 
I 
did," 
Natasha 
replied 
in 
a 
voice 
that 
pleaded 
to 
be 
left
in 
peace.

Both 
the 
countess 
and 
Sonya 
understood 
that, 
naturally, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EP6vf2J1gcnoA.html">neither</a> 
Moscow
nor 
the 
burning 
of 
Moscow 
nor 
anything 
else 
could 
seem 
of 
importance 
to
Natasha.

The 
count 
returned 
and 
lay 
down 
behind 
the 
partition. 
The 
countess 
went
up 
to 
her 
daughter 
and 
touched 
her 
head 
with 
the 
back 
of 
her 
hand 
as 
she
was 
wont 
to 
do 
when 
Natasha 
was 
ill, 
then 
touched 
her 
forehead 
with 
her
lips 
as 
if 
to 
feel 
whether 
she 
was 
feverish, 
and 
finally 
kissed 
her.

"You 
are 
cold. 
You 
are 
trembling 
all 
over. 
You'd 
better 
lie 
down," 
<a href="/cZl/Uc3Gj58ogilO.html">said
the</a> 
countess.

"Lie 
down? 
All 
right, 
I 
will. 
I'll 
lie 
down 
at 
once," 
said 
Natasha.

When 
Natasha 
had 
been 
told 
that 
morning 
that 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
seriously
wounded 
and 
was<p>
traveling 
with 
their 
party, 
she 
had 
at 
first 
asked 
many
questions: 
Where 
was 
he 
going? 
How 
was 
he 
wounded? 
Was 
it 
serious? 
And
could 
she 
see 
him? 
But 
after 
she 
had 
been 
told 
that 
she 
could 
not 
see
him, 
that 
he 
was 
seriously 
wounded 
but 
that 
his 
life 
was 
not 
in 
danger,
she 
ceased 
to 
ask 
questions 
or 
to 
speak 
at 
all, 
evidently 
disbelieving
what 
they 
told 
her, 
and 
convinced 
that 
say 
what 
she 
might 
she 
would
still 
be 
told 
the 
same. 
All 
the 
way 
she 
had 
sat 
motionless 
in 
a 
corner
of<p>
the 
coach 
with 
wide 
open 
eyes, 
and 
the 
expression 
in 
them 
which 
the
countess 
knew 
so 
well 
and 
feared 
so
