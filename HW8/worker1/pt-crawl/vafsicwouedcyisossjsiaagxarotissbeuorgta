CHAPTER 
XXXIII

On 
the 
third 
of 
September 
Pierre 
awoke 
late. 
His 
head 
was 
aching, 
the
clothes 
in 
which 
he 
had 
slept 
without 
undressing 
felt 
uncomfortable 
on
his 
body, 
and 
his 
mind 
had 
a 
dim 
consciousness 
of 
something 
shameful
he 
had 
done 
the 
day 
before. 
That 
something 
shameful 
was 
his 
yesterday's
conversation 
with 
Captain 
Ramballe.

It 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Dd9XZEHJ3g8CKMN.html">was</a> 
eleven 
by 
the 
clock, 
but 
it 
seemed 
peculiarly 
dark 
out 
of 
doors.
Pierre 
rose, 
rubbed 
his 
eyes, 
and 
seeing 
the 
pistol 
with 
an 
engraved
stock 
which 
Gerasim 
had 
replaced 
on 
the 
writing 
table, 
he 
remembered
where 
he 
was 
and 
what 
lay 
before 
him 
<a href="/cZl/xp9U8P.html">that</a> 
very 
day.

"Am 
I 
not 
too 
late?" 
he 
thought. 
"No, 
probably 
he 
won't 
make 
his 
entry
into 
Moscow 
before 
noon."

Pierre 
did 
not 
allow 
himself 
to 
reflect 
on 
what 
lay 
before 
him,<p>
but
hastened 
to 
act.

After 
arranging 
his 
clothes, 
he 
took 
the 
pistol 
and 
was 
about 
to 
go 
out.
But 
it 
then 
occurred 
to 
him 
for 
the 
first 
time 
that 
he 
certainly 
could
not 
carry 
the 
weapon 
in 
his 
hand 
through 
the 
streets. 
It 
was 
difficult
to 
hide 
such 
a 
big 
pistol 
even 
under 
his 
wide 
coat. 
He 
could 
not
carry 
it 
unnoticed 
in 
his 
belt 
or 
under 
his 
arm. 
Besides, 
it 
had 
been
discharged, 
and 
he 
had 
not 
had 
time 
to 
reload<p>
it. 
"No 
matter, 
the 
dagger
will 
do," 
he 
said 
to 
himself, 
though 
when<p>
planning 
his 
design 
he 
had
more 
than 
once 
come 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that
