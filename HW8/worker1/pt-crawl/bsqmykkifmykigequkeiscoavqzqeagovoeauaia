Bennigsen 
spoke 
to 
a</h1>general 
who 
approached 
him, 
and 
began 
explaining
the 
whole 
position 
of 
our 
troops. 
Pierre 
listened 
to 
him, 
straining 
each
faculty 
to 
understand 
the 
essential 
points 
of 
the 
impending 
battle, 
but
was 
mortified 
to 
feel 
that 
his 
mental 
capacity 
was 
inadequate 
for 
the
task. 
He 
could 
make 
nothing 
of 
it. 
Bennigsen 
stopped 
speaking 
and,
noticing 
that 
Pierre 
was 
listening, 
suddenly 
said 
to 
him:

"I 
don't 
think 
this 
interests 
you?"

"On 
the 
contrary 
it's 
very 
interesting!" 
replied 
Pierre 
not 
quite
truthfully.

From 
the 
fleches 
they 
rode 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UK9Z7Uo.html">still</a> 
farther 
to 
the 
left, 
along 
a 
road
winding 
through 
a 
thick, 
low-growing 
birch 
wood. 
<a href="/aVzUge/gc1vf0sVDPn3.html">In</a> 
the 
middle 
of 
the
wood 
a 
brown 
hare 
with 
white 
feet 
sprang 
out 
and, 
scared 
by 
the 
tramp 
of
the 
many 
horses, 
grew 
so<p>
confused 
that 
it 
leaped 
along 
the 
road 
in 
front
of 
them 
for 
some 
time, 
arousing 
general 
attention 
and 
<a href="/cZl/Cw38mTUVM5WVP.html">laughter,</a> 
and 
only
when 
several 
voices 
shouted 
at 
it 
did 
it 
dart 
to 
one 
side 
and 
disappear
in 
the 
thicket. 
After 
going 
through 
the 
wood 
for 
about 
a 
mile 
and 
a 
half
they 
came 
out 
on 
a 
glade 
where 
troops 
of 
Tuchkov's 
corps 
were 
stationed
to 
defend 
the 
left 
flank.

Here, 
at 
the 
extreme 
left 
flank, 
Bennigsen 
talked 
a 
great 
deal 
and 
with
much 
heat, 
and, 
as 
it 
seemed 
to 
Pierre, 
gave 
orders 
of 
great<p>
military
importance. 
In 
front 
of 
Tuchkov's 
troops 
was 
some 
high 
ground 
not
occupied 
by 
troops. 
Bennigsen 
loudly 
criticized 
this 
mistake, 
saying
that 
it 
was 
madness 
to 
leave 
a 
height 
which 
commanded 
the 
country 
around
unoccupied 
and 
to 
place 
troops 
below 
it. 
Some 
of 
the 
generals 
expressed
the 
same 
opinion. 
One 
in 
particular 
declared 
with 
martial 
heat 
that 
they
were 
put 
there 
to 
be 
slaughtered. 
Bennigsen 
on 
his 
own 
authority 
ordered
the 
troops 
to 
occupy 
the 
high 
ground. 
This 
disposition 
on 
the 
left 
flank
increased 
Pierre's 
doubt 
of 
his 
own 
capacity 
to 
understand 
military
matters. 
Listening 
to 
Bennigsen 
and 
the 
generals 
criticizing 
the
position 
of 
the 
troops 
behind 
the 
hill, 
he 
quite 
understood 
them 
and
shared 
their 
opinion, 
but 
for 
that 
very 
reason 
he 
could 
not 
understand
how 
the 
man 
who 
put 
them 
there 
behind 
the 
hill 
could 
have 
made 
so 
gross
and 
palpable 
a 
blunder.

Pierre 
did 
not 
know 
that 
these 
troops 
were 
not, 
as 
Bennigsen 
supposed,
put 
there 
to 
<a href="/aVzUge/TIA5C5to4LNZ.html">defend</a> 
the 
position, 
but 
were 
in 
a 
concealed 
position 
as
an 
ambush, 
that 
they 
should 
not 
be 
seen<p>
and 
might 
be 
able 
to 
strike 
an
approaching 
enemy 
unexpectedly. 
Bennigsen 
did 
not 
know 
this 
and
