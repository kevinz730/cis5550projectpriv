saw</h1>how 
the 
Emperor's 
rather
round 
shoulders 
shuddered 
as 
if 
a 
cold 
shiver 
had 
run 
down 
them, 
how 
his
left 
foot 
began 
convulsively 
tapping 
the 
horse's 
side 
with 
the 
spur,
and 
how 
the 
well-trained 
horse 
looked 
round 
unconcerned 
and 
did 
not
stir. 
An 
adjutant, 
dismounting, 
lifted 
the 
soldier 
under 
the 
arms 
to
place 
him 
on 
a 
stretcher 
that 
had<p>
been 
brought. 
The 
soldier 
groaned.

"Gently, 
gently! 
Can't 
you 
do 
it 
more 
gently?" 
said 
the 
Emperor
apparently 
suffering 
more 
than 
the 
dying 
soldier, 
and 
he 
rode 
away.

Rostov 
saw 
tears 
filling 
the 
Emperor's 
eyes 
and 
heard 
him, 
as 
he 
was
riding 
away, 
say 
to 
Czartoryski: 
"What 
a 
terrible 
thing 
war 
is: 
what
a 
terrible 
thing! 
Quelle 
terrible 
chose 
que 
la 
guerre!"

The<p>
troops 
of<p>
the 
vanguard 
were 
stationed 
before 
Wischau, 
within 
sight
of 
the 
enemy's 
lines, 
which 
all 
day 
long 
had 
yielded 
ground 
to 
us
at 
the 
least 
firing. 
The 
Emperor's 
gratitude 
was 
announced 
to 
the
vanguard, 
rewards 
were 
promised, 
and 
the 
men 
received 
a 
double 
ration 
of
vodka. 
The 
campfires 
crackled 
and 
the 
soldiers' 
songs 
resounded
even 
more 
merrily 
than 
on 
the 
previous 
night. 
Denisov 
celebrated 
his
promotion 
to 
the 
rank 
of 
major, 
and 
Rostov, 
who 
had 
already 
drunk
enough, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
feast 
proposed 
the 
Emperor's 
health. 
"Not
'our 
Sovereign, 
the 
Emperor,' 
as 
they 
say 
at 
official 
dinners,"
said 
he, 
"but 
the 
health 
of 
our 
Sovereign, 
that 
good, 
enchanting, 
and
great 
man! 
Let 
us 
drink 
to 
his 
health 
and 
to 
the 
certain 
defeat 
of 
the
French!"

"If 
we 
fought 
before," 
he 
said, 
"not 
letting 
the 
French 
pass, 
as
at 
Schoen 
Grabern, 
what 
shall 
we 
not 
do 
now 
when 
he 
is 
at 
the 
front? 
We
will 
all 
die 
for 
him 
gladly! 
Is 
it 
not 
so, 
gentlemen? 
Perhaps 
I 
am 
not
saying 
it 
right, 
I 
have 
drunk 
a 
good 
deal-but 
that 
is 
how 
I 
feel, 
and
so 
do 
you 
too! 
To 
the 
health 
of<p>
Alexander 
the 
First! 
Hurrah!"

"Hurrah!" 
rang 
the 
enthusiastic 
voices 
of 
the 
officers.

And 
the 
old 
cavalry 
captain, 
Kirsten, 
shouted 
enthusiastically 
and 
no
less<p>
sincerely 
than 
the 
twenty-year-old 
Rostov.

When 
the 
officers 
had 
emptied 
and 
smashed 
their 
glasses, 
Kirsten 
filled
others 
and, 
in 
shirt 
sleeves 
and 
breeches, 
went 
glass 
in 
hand 
to 
the
soldiers' 
bonfires 
and 
with 
his 
long 
gray 
mustache, 
his 
white 
chest
showing 
under 
his 
open 
shirt, 
he 
stood 
in 
a 
majestic 
pose 
in 
the 
light
of 
the 
campfire, 
waving 
his 
uplifted 
arm.

"Lads! 
here's 
to 
our 
Sovereign, 
the 
Emperor, 
and 
victory 
over
our 
enemies! 
Hurrah!" 
he 
exclaimed 
in 
his 
dashing, 
old, 
hussar's
baritone.

The 
hussars 
crowded 
round 
and 
responded 
heartily 
with 
loud 
shouts.

Late 
that 
night, 
when 
all 
had 
separated, 
Denisov 
with 
his 
short 
hand
patted 
his 
favorite, 
Rostov, 
on 
the 
shoulder.

"As 
there's 
no 
one 
to 
fall 
in 
love 
with 
on 
campaign, 
he's 
fallen
in 
love 
with 
the 
Tsar," 
he 
said.

"Denisov, 
don't 
make 
fun 
of 
it!" 
cried 
Rostov. 
"It 
is 
such 
a
lofty, 
beautiful 
feeling, 
such 
a..."

"I 
believe 
it, 
I 
believe 
it, 
fwiend, 
and 
I 
share 
and 
appwove..."

"No, 
you 
don't 
understand!"

And 
Rostov 
got 
up 
and 
went 
wandering 
among 
the 
campfires, 
dreaming 
of
what 
happiness 
it 
would 
be 
to 
die-not 
in 
saving 
the 
Emperor's 
life
(he 
did 
not 
even 
dare 
to 
dream 
of 
that), 
but 
simply 
to 
die 
before 
his
eyes. 
He 
really 
was 
in 
love<p>
with 
the 
Tsar 
and 
the 
glory 
of 
the 
Russian
arms 
and
