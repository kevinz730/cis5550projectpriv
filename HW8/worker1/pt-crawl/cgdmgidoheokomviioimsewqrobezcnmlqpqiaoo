"Is 
Papa 
at 
home?" 
he 
asked.

"I 
am 
so 
glad 
you've 
come!" 
said 
Natasha, 
without 
answering 
him.
"We 
are 
enjoying 
ourselves! 
Vasili 
Dmitrich 
is 
staying 
a 
day 
longer
for 
my 
sake! 
Did 
you 
know?"

"No, 
Papa 
is 
not 
back 
yet," 
said 
Sonya.

"Nicholas, 
have 
you 
come? 
Come 
here, 
dear!" 
called 
the 
old 
countess
from 
the 
drawing 
room.

Nicholas 
went 
to 
her, 
kissed 
her 
hand, 
and 
sitting 
down 
silently 
at 
her
table 
began 
to 
watch 
her 
hands 
arranging 
the 
cards. 
From 
the 
dancing
room, 
they 
still 
heard 
the 
laughter 
and 
merry 
voices 
trying 
to 
persuade
Natasha 
to 
sing.

"All 
wight! 
All 
wight!" 
shouted 
Denisov. 
"It's 
no 
good 
making
excuses 
now! 
It's 
your 
turn 
to 
sing 
the 
ba'cawolla-I 
entweat
you!"

The 
countess 
glanced 
at 
her 
silent 
son.

"What 
is 
the 
matter?" 
she 
asked.

"Oh, 
nothing," 
said 
he, 
as 
if 
weary 
of 
being 
continually 
asked 
the
same 
question. 
"Will 
Papa 
be 
back 
soon?"

"I 
expect 
so."

"Everything's 
the 
same 
with 
them. 
They 
know 
nothing 
about 
it! 
Where
am 
I 
to 
go?" 
thought 
Nicholas, 
and 
went 
again 
into 
the 
dancing 
room
where 
the 
clavichord 
stood.

Sonya 
was 
sitting 
at 
the 
clavichord, 
playing 
the 
prelude 
to
Denisov's 
favorite 
barcarolle. 
Natasha 
was 
preparing 
to 
sing.
Denisov 
was 
looking 
at 
her 
with 
enraptured 
eyes.

Nicholas 
began 
pacing 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room.

"Why 
do 
they 
want 
to 
make 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xk9CyE4dcFeE.html">her</a> 
sing? 
How 
can 
she 
sing? 
There's
nothing 
to 
be 
happy 
about!" 
thought 
he.

Sonya 
struck 
the 
first 
chord 
of 
the 
prelude.

"My 
God, 
I'm 
a 
ruined 
and 
dishonored 
man! 
A 
bullet 
through 
<a href="/cZl/hK9It2AJH8Ztx.html">my</a> 
brain
is 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/SF5eI30vC.html">only</a> 
thing<p>
left 
me-not 
singing!" 
his 
thoughts 
ran 
on. 
"Go
away? 
But 
where 
to? 
It's 
one-let 
them 
sing!"

He 
continued 
to 
pace 
the 
room, 
looking 
gloomily 
at 
Denisov 
and 
the
girls 
and 
avoiding 
their 
eyes.

"Nikolenka, 
what 
is 
the 
matter?" 
Sonya's 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
him
seemed 
to 
ask. 
She 
noticed 
at 
once 
that 
something 
had 
happened 
to 
him.

Nicholas 
turned 
away 
from 
her. 
Natasha 
too, 
with 
her 
quick 
instinct,
had 
instantly 
noticed 
her 
brother's 
condition. 
But, 
though 
she 
noticed
it, 
she<p>
was 
herself 
in 
such 
high 
spirits 
at 
that 
moment, 
so 
far 
from
sorrow, 
sadness, 
or 
self-reproach, 
that 
she 
purposely 
deceived 
herself
as 
young 
people 
often 
do. 
"No, 
I 
am<p>
too 
happy 
now 
to 
spoil 
my
enjoyment 
by 
sympathy<p>
with 
anyone's 
sorrow," 
she 
felt, 
and 
she 
said
to 
herself: 
"No, 
I 
must 
be 
mistaken, 
he 
must 
be 
feeling 
happy, 
just 
as
I 
am."

"Now, 
Sonya!" 
she 
said, 
going 
to 
the 
very 
middle 
of 
the 
room, 
where
she 
considered 
the 
resonance 
was 
best.

Having 
lifted 
her 
head 
and 
let 
her 
arms 
droop 
lifelessly, 
as 
ballet
dancers 
do, 
Natasha, 
rising 
energetically 
from 
her 
heels 
to 
her 
toes,
stepped 
to 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room 
and 
stood 
still.

"Yes, 
that's 
me!"<p>
