the 
conversational 
machine 
<a href="/aVzUge/oC5mGGRm7vxtj7Qb.html">in</a> 
steady,
proper, 
and 
regular 
motion. 
But 
amid 
these 
cares 
her 
anxiety 
about
Pierre 
was 
evident. 
She 
kept 
an 
anxious 
watch 
on 
him 
when 
<a href="/aVzUge/Og9w11xhL.html">he</a> 
approached
the 
group 
round 
Mortemart<p>
to 
listen<p>
to 
what 
was 
being 
said 
there, 
and
again 
when 
he 
passed 
to 
another 
group 
whose 
center<p>
was 
the 
abbe.

Pierre 
had 
been<p>
educated 
abroad, 
and 
this 
reception 
at 
Anna
Pavlovna's 
was 
the 
first 
he 
had 
attended 
in 
Russia. 
He 
knew 
that 
all
the 
intellectual 
lights 
of 
Petersburg 
were 
gathered 
there 
and, 
like 
a
child 
in 
a 
toyshop, 
did 
not 
know 
which 
way 
to 
look, 
afraid 
of 
missing
any 
clever 
conversation 
that 
was 
to 
be 
heard. 
Seeing 
the 
self-confident
and 
refined 
expression 
on 
the 
faces 
of 
those 
present 
he 
was 
always
expecting 
to 
hear 
something 
very 
profound. 
At 
last 
he 
came 
up 
to 
Morio.
Here 
the 
conversation 
seemed 
interesting 
and 
he 
stood 
waiting 
for 
an
opportunity 
to 
express 
his 
own 
views, 
as 
young 
people 
are 
fond
