arise 
either 
because, 
being 
easy

also
doubts 
concerning 
the 
real 
value 
of 
such 
histories 
arise 
either 
<a href="/aVzUge/UN5meoou07KpkPN.html">because
too</a> 
many 
of

because 
in 
his

someone

by 
what

did 
Napoleon 
do 
this?-that 
is, 
wants
to 
exchange 
the 
current 
paper 
money 
for 
the 
real 
gold 
of 
actual
comprehension.

The 
writers 
of 
universal 
histories 
and 
of 
the 
history 
of 
culture 
are
like 
people 
who, 
recognizing 
the 
defects 
of 
paper 
money, 
decide 
to
substitute 
for 
it 
money 
made 
of 
metal 
that 
has 
not 
the 
specific 
gravity
of 
gold. 
It 
may 
indeed 
make 
jingling 
coin, 
but 
will 
do 
no 
more 
than
that. 
Paper 
money 
may 
deceive 
the 
ignorant, 
but 
nobody 
is 
deceived 
by
tokens 
of<p>
base 
metal 
that 
have 
no 
value 
but 
merely 
jingle. 
As 
gold 
is
gold 
only 
if 
it 
is 
serviceable 
not 
merely 
for 
exchange 
but 
also 
for 
use,
so 
universal 
historians 
will 
be 
valuable 
only 
when 
they 
can 
reply 
to
history's 
essential 
question: 
what 
is 
power? 
The 
universal 
historians
give 
contradictory 
replies 
to 
that 
question, 
while 
the 
historians 
of
culture 
evade 
it 
and 
answer 
something 
quite 
different. 
And 
as 
counters
of 
imitation 
gold 
can 
be 
used 
only 
among 
a 
group 
of 
people 
who 
agree 
to
accept 
them 
as 
gold, 
or 
among 
those 
who 
do 
not 
know 
the 
nature 
of
gold, 
so 
universal 
historians 
and 
historians 
of 
culture, 
not 
answering
humanity's 
essential 
question, 
serve 
as 
currency 
for 
some 
purposes 
of
their 
<a href="/aVzUge/LX7sfA7zr.html">own,</a> 
only 
in 
universities 
and 
among 
the 
mass 
of 
readers 
who 
have 
a
taste 
for 
what 
they 
call 
"serious 
reading."





CHAPTER 
IV

Having 
abandoned 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
ancients 
as 
to 
the 
divine
subjection 
of 
the 
will 
of 
a 
nation 
to 
some 
chosen 
man 
and 
the 
subjection
of 
that 
man's 
will 
to 
the 
Deity, 
history 
cannot 
without 
contradictions
take 
a 
single 
step 
till 
it 
has 
chosen 
one 
of 
two 
things: 
either 
a 
return
to 
the 
former 
belief 
in 
the 
direct 
intervention 
of 
the 
Deity 
in 
human
affairs 
or 
a<p>
definite 
explanation 
of 
the 
meaning 
of<p>
the 
force 
producing
historical 
events 
and 
termed 
"power."

A 
return 
to 
the 
first 
is 
impossible, 
the 
belief 
has 
been 
destroyed; 
and
so 
it 
is 
essential 
to 
explain 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
power.

Napoleon 
ordered 
an 
army 
to 
be 
raised 
and 
go 
to 
war. 
We 
are 
so
accustomed 
to 
that 
idea 
and 
have 
become 
so 
used 
to 
it 
that 
the 
question:
why 
did 
six 
hundred 
thousand 
men 
go 
to 
fight 
when 
Napoleon 
uttered
certain 
words, 
seems 
to 
us 
senseless. 
He 
had 
the 
power 
and 
so 
what 
he
ordered 
was 
done.

This 
reply 
is 
quite 
satisfactory 
if 
we 
believe 
that 
the 
power 
was 
given
him 
by 
God. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
do 
not 
admit 
that, 
it 
becomes 
essential 
to
determine 
what 
is 
this 
power 
of 
one 
man 
over 
others.

It 
cannot 
be 
the 
direct 
physical 
power 
of 
a 
strong 
man 
over 
a 
weak 
one-a
domination 
based 
on 
the 
application 
or 
threat 
of 
physical 
force, 
like
the 
power 
of<p>
Hercules; 
nor 
can 
it 
be 
based 
on 
the 
effect 
of 
moral 
force,
as 
in 
their 
simplicity 
some 
historians 
think 
who 
say 
that 
the 
leading
figures 
in 
history 
are 
heroes, 
that 
is, 
men 
gifted 
with 
a 
special
strength 
of 
soul 
and 
mind 
called 
genius. 
This 
power 
cannot 
be 
based 
on
the 
predominance 
of 
moral 
strength, 
for, 
not 
to 
mention 
heroes 
such 
as
Napoleon 
about 
whose 
moral 
qualities 
opinions 
differ 
widely, 
history
shows 
us 
that 
neither 
a 
Louis 
XI 
nor 
a 
Metternich, 
who 
ruled 
over
millions 
of 
people, 
had 
any 
particular 
moral 
qualities, 
but 
on 
the
contrary 
were 
generally 
morally 
weaker 
than 
any 
of 
the 
millions 
they
ruled 
over.

If 
the 
source 
of 
power 
lies 
neither 
in 
the 
physical 
nor
