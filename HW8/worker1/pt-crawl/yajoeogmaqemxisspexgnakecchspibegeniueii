Nicholas 
still 
further 
captivated</h1>the 
provincial
society 
by 
his 
agility. 
His 
particularly 
free 
manner 
of 
dancing 
even
surprised 
them 
all. 
Nicholas 
was 
himself 
rather 
surprised 
at 
the 
way 
he
danced 
that 
evening. 
He 
had 
never 
danced 
like 
that 
in 
Moscow 
and 
would
even 
have 
considered 
such 
a 
very 
free 
and 
easy 
manner 
improper 
and 
in
bad 
form, 
but 
here 
he 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/GoY5tHLaX8y2oFuln.html">felt</a> 
it 
incumbent 
on 
him 
to 
astonish 
them 
all 
by
something 
unusual, 
something 
they 
would 
have 
to 
accept 
as 
the 
regular
thing 
in 
the<p>
capital 
though 
new 
to 
them 
in 
the 
provinces.

All 
the 
evening 
Nicholas 
paid 
attention 
to 
a 
blue-eyed, 
plump<p>
and
pleasing 
little 
blonde, 
the 
wife 
of 
one 
of 
the 
provincial 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jbn1GBzwy5Bxal6mAz.html">officials.
With</a> 
the 
naive 
conviction 
of 
young 
men 
in 
a 
merry 
mood 
that 
other 
men's
wives 
were 
created 
for 
them, 
Rostov 
did 
not 
leave 
the 
lady's 
side 
and
treated 
her 
husband 
in 
a 
friendly 
and 
conspiratorial 
style, 
as 
if,
without 
speaking 
of 
it, 
they 
knew 
how 
capitally 
Nicholas 
and 
the 
lady
would 
get 
on 
together. 
The 
husband, 
however, 
did 
not 
seem 
to 
share 
that
conviction 
and 
tried 
to 
behave 
morosely 
with 
Rostov. 
But 
the
latter's 
good-natured 
naivete 
was 
so 
boundless 
that 
sometimes 
even 
he
involuntarily 
yielded 
to 
Nicholas' 
good 
humor. 
Toward 
the 
end 
of 
the
evening, 
however, 
as 
the 
wife's 
face 
grew 
more 
flushed 
and 
animated, 
the
husband's 
became 
more 
and 
more 
melancholy 
and 
solemn, 
as 
though 
there
were 
but 
a 
given 
amount 
of 
animation 
between 
them 
and 
as 
the 
wife's
share 
increased 
the 
husband's 
diminished.





CHAPTER 
V

Nicholas 
sat 
leaning 
slightly 
forward 
in 
an 
armchair, 
bending 
closely
over 
the 
blonde 
lady 
and 
paying 
her 
mythological 
compliments 
with 
a
smile 
that 
never 
left 
his 
face. 
Jauntily 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tiR9CWm3gi4.html">shifting</a> 
the 
position 
of 
his
legs 
in 
their 
tight 
riding 
breeches, 
diffusing 
an 
odor 
of 
perfume, 
and
admiring 
his 
partner, 
himself, 
and 
the 
fine 
outlines 
of 
his 
legs 
in
their 
well-fitting 
Hessian 
boots, 
Nicholas 
told 
the 
blonde 
lady 
that 
he
wished 
to 
run 
away 
with 
a 
certain 
lady 
here 
in 
Voronezh.

"Which 
lady?"

"A 
charming 
lady, 
a 
divine 
one. 
Her 
eyes" 
(Nicholas 
looked 
at 
his
partner) 
"are 
blue, 
her 
mouth 
coral 
and 
ivory; 
her 
figure"

glanced
