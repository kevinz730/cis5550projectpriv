the</h1>columns 
of 
infantry, 
cavalry, 
and 
artillery,
which 
were 
to 
be 
the 
first 
to 
descend 
the 
heights 
to 
attack 
the 
French
right 
flank 
and 
drive 
it 
into 
the 
Bohemian 
mountains 
according 
to 
plan,
were 
already 
up 
and 
astir. 
The 
smoke 
of 
the 
campfires, 
into 
which 
they
were 
throwing<p>
everything 
superfluous, 
made 
the 
eyes 
smart. 
It 
was 
cold
and 
dark. 
The 
officers 
were 
hurriedly 
drinking 
tea 
and 
breakfasting, 
the
soldiers, 
munching 
biscuit 
and 
beating 
a 
tattoo 
with 
their 
feet 
to
warm 
themselves, 
gathering 
round 
the 
fires 
throwing 
into 
the 
flames 
the
remains 
of 
sheds, 
chairs, 
tables, 
wheels, 
tubs, 
and 
everything 
that 
they
did 
not 
want 
or 
could 
not 
carry 
away 
with 
them. 
Austrian 
column 
guides
were 
moving 
in 
and 
out 
among 
the 
Russian 
troops 
and 
served 
as 
heralds
of 
the 
advance. 
As 
soon 
as 
an 
Austrian 
officer 
showed 
himself 
near
a 
commanding 
officer's 
quarters, 
the 
regiment 
began 
to 
move: 
the
soldiers 
ran 
from 
the 
fires, 
thrust 
their 
pipes 
into 
their 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NI5dBoY8m.html">boots,</a> 
their
bags 
into 
the 
carts, 
got 
their 
muskets 
ready, 
and 
formed 
rank. 
The
officers 
buttoned 
up 
their 
coats, 
buckled 
on 
their 
swords 
and 
pouches,
and 
moved 
along 
the 
ranks 
shouting. 
The 
train 
drivers 
and 
orderlies
harnessed 
and 
packed 
the 
wagons 
and 
tied 
on 
the 
loads. 
The 
adjutants 
and
battalion 
and 
regimental 
commanders 
mounted, 
crossed 
themselves, 
gave
final 
instructions, 
orders, 
and 
commissions 
to 
the 
baggage 
men
who 
remained 
behind, 
and 
the 
monotonous 
tramp 
of 
thousands 
of 
feet
resounded. 
The 
column 
moved 
forward 
without 
knowing 
where 
and 
unable,
from 
the 
masses 
around 
them, 
the 
smoke 
and 
the 
increasing 
fog, 
to 
see
either 
the 
place 
they 
were 
leaving 
or 
that 
to 
which 
they 
were 
going.

A 
soldier 
on 
the 
march 
is 
hemmed 
in 
and 
borne 
along 
by 
his 
regiment 
as
much 
as 
a 
sailor 
is 
by 
his 
ship. 
However 
far 
he 
has 
walked, 
whatever
strange, 
unknown, 
and 
dangerous 
places 
he 
reaches, 
just 
as 
a 
sailor 
is
always 
surrounded 
by 
the 
same 
decks, 
masts, 
and 
rigging 
of 
his 
ship, 
so
the 
soldier 
always 
has 
around 
him 
the 
same 
comrades, 
the 
same 
ranks, 
the
same 
sergeant 
major 
Ivan 
Mitrich, 
the 
same 
company 
dog 
Jack, 
and 
the
same<p>
commanders. 
The 
sailor 
rarely 
cares 
to 
know 
the 
latitude 
in 
which
his 
ship 
is 
sailing, 
but 
on 
the 
day 
of 
battle-heaven 
knows 
how 
and
whence-a 
stern 
note 
of 
which 
all 
are 
conscious 
sounds 
in 
the 
moral
atmosphere 
of 
an 
army, 
announcing 
the 
approach 
of 
something 
decisive
and 
solemn, 
and 
awakening 
in 
the 
men 
an 
unusual 
curiosity. 
On 
the 
day 
of
battle 
the 
soldiers 
excitedly 
try 
to 
get 
beyond 
the 
interests<p>
of 
their
regiment, 
they 
listen 
intently, 
look 
about, 
and 
eagerly 
ask 
concerning
what 
is 
going 
on 
around 
them.

The 
fog 
had 
grown 
so 
dense 
that 
though 
it 
was 
growing 
light 
they 
could
not 
see 
ten 
paces 
ahead. 
Bushes 
looked 
like 
gigantic 
trees 
and 
level
ground 
like 
cliffs 
and 
slopes. 
Anywhere, 
on 
any 
side, 
one 
might
encounter 
an 
enemy 
invisible 
ten 
paces 
off. 
But 
the 
columns 
advanced
for 
a 
long 
time, 
always 
in 
the 
same 
fog, 
descending 
and 
ascending 
hills,
avoiding 
gardens 
and 
enclosures, 
going 
over 
new 
and 
unknown 
ground, 
and
nowhere 
encountering 
the 
enemy. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
soldiers 
became
aware 
that<p>
in 
front, 
behind, 
and 
on 
all 
sides, 
other 
Russian 
columns
were 
moving 
in 
the 
same 
direction. 
Every 
soldier 
felt 
glad 
to 
know 
that
to 
the 
unknown 
place 
where 
he 
was 
going, 
many 
more 
of 
our 
men 
were 
going
too.

"There 
now, 
the 
Kurskies 
have 
also 
gone 
past," 
was 
being 
said 
in
the 
ranks.

"It's 
wonderful 
what 
a 
lot 
of 
our 
troops 
have 
gathered, 
lads! 
Last
night 
I 
looked 
at 
the 
campfires 
and 
there 
was 
no 
end 
of 
them. 
A 
regular
Moscow!"
