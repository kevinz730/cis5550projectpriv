the 
folds 
of 
her 
short 
muslin 
frock,
darted 
in 
and 
stopped 
short 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room. 
It 
was 
evident
that 
she 
had 
not 
intended 
her 
flight 
to 
bring 
her 
so 
far. 
Behind 
her 
in
the 
<a href="/cZl/Bh2bI7WG6DbPtL.html">doorway</a> 
appeared 
a 
student 
with 
a 
crimson 
coat 
collar, 
an 
officer
of 
the 
Guards, 
a 
girl 
of 
fifteen, 
and 
a 
plump 
rosy-faced 
boy 
in 
a 
short
jacket.

The 
count 
jumped 
up 
and, 
swaying 
from 
side 
to 
side, 
spread 
his 
arms 
wide
and 
threw 
them 
round 
the 
little 
girl 
who 
had 
run 
in.

"Ah, 
here 
she 
is!" 
he 
exclaimed 
laughing. 
"My 
pet, 
whose 
name 
day
it 
is. 
My 
dear 
pet!"

"Ma 
chere, 
there 
is 
a 
time 
for 
everything," 
said 
the 
countess 
with
feigned 
severity. 
<a href="/cZl/ju37Ta6o.html">"You</a> 
spoil 
her, 
Ilya," 
she 
<a href="/aVzUge/AgW8bvO9EPTad2rP.html">added,</a> 
turning 
to 
her
husband.

"How 
do 
you 
do, 
my 
dear? 
I 
wish 
you 
many 
happy 
returns 
of 
your 
name
day," 
said 
the 
visitor. 
"What 
a 
charming 
child," 
she 
added,
addressing 
the 
mother.

This 
black-eyed, 
wide-mouthed 
girl, 
not 
pretty 
but 
full 
of 
life-with
childish 
bare 
shoulders 
which 
after 
her 
run 
heaved 
and 
shook 
her
bodice, 
with 
black 
curls 
tossed 
backward, 
thin 
bare 
arms, 
little 
legs
in 
lace-frilled 
drawers, 
and 
feet 
in 
low 
slippers-was 
just 
at 
that
charming 
age<p>
when 
a 
girl 
is 
no 
longer 
<a href="/aVzUge/ZUI6tQp05Akk.html">a</a> 
child, 
though 
the 
child 
is 
not
yet 
a 
young 
woman. 
Escaping 
from 
her 
father
