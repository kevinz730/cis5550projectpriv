became 
still 
more 
acute</h1>and 
we 
withdrew 
still 
farther, 
because
Barclay 
de 
Tolly 
was 
an 
unpopular 
foreigner<p>
disliked 
by 
Bagration 
(who
would 
come 
under 
his 
command), 
and 
Bagration-being 
in 
command 
of 
the
second 
army-tried 
to 
postpone 
joining 
up 
and 
coming 
under 
Barclay's
command 
as 
long 
as 
he 
could. 
Bagration 
was 
slow 
in 
effecting 
the
junction-though 
that 
was 
the 
chief 
aim 
of 
all 
at 
headquarters-because,
as 
he 
alleged, 
he 
exposed 
his 
army 
to 
danger 
on 
this 
march, 
and 
it 
was
best 
for 
him 
to 
retire 
more 
to 
the 
left 
and 
more 
to 
the 
south, 
worrying
the 
enemy 
from 
flank 
and 
rear 
and 
securing 
from 
the 
Ukraine 
recruits 
for
his 
army; 
and 
it 
looks 
as 
if 
he 
planned 
this 
in 
order 
not 
to 
come 
under
the 
command 
of 
the 
detested 
foreigner 
Barclay, 
whose 
rank 
was 
inferior
to 
his 
own.

The 
Emperor 
was 
with 
the 
army 
to 
encourage 
it, 
but 
his 
presence 
and
ignorance 
of 
what 
steps 
to 
take, 
and 
the 
enormous<p>
number 
of 
advisers 
and
plans, 
destroyed 
the 
first 
army's 
energy 
and 
it 
retired.

The 
intention 
was 
to 
make 
a 
stand 
at 
the 
Drissa 
camp, 
but 
Paulucci,
aiming 
at 
becoming 
commander 
in 
chief, 
unexpectedly 
employed 
his 
energy
to 
influence 
Alexander, 
and 
Pfuel's 
whole 
plan 
was 
abandoned 
and 
the
command 
entrusted 
to 
Barclay. 
But 
as 
Barclay 
did 
not 
inspire 
confidence
his 
power 
was 
limited. 
The 
armies 
were 
divided, 
there 
was 
no 
unity 
of
command, 
and 
Barclay 
was 
unpopular; 
but 
from 
this 
confusion, 
division,
and 
the 
unpopularity 
of 
the 
foreign 
commander 
in 
chief, 
there 
resulted
on 
the 
one 
hand 
indecision 
and 
the 
avoidance 
of 
a 
battle 
(which 
we 
could
not 
have 
refrained 
from 
had 
the 
armies 
been 
united 
and 
had 
someone 
else,
instead 
of 
Barclay, 
been 
in 
command) 
and 
on 
the 
other 
an 
ever-increasing
indignation 
against 
the 
foreigners 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
patriotic 
zeal.

At 
last 
the 
Emperor 
left 
the 
army, 
and 
as 
the 
most 
convenient 
and 
indeed
the 
only 
pretext 
for 
his 
departure 
it 
was 
decided 
that 
it 
was 
necessary
for 
him
