inherit 
his 
immense 
fortune, 
Pierre
or 
Prince 
Vasili. 
Forty 
thousand 
serfs 
and 
millions 
of 
rubles! 
I 
know
it 
all 
very 
well 
for 
Prince 
Vasili 
told 
me 
himself. 
Besides, 
Cyril
Vladimirovich 
is 
my 
mother's 
second 
cousin. 
He's 
also 
my 
Bory's
godfather," 
she 
added, 
as 
if 
she 
attached 
no 
importance 
at 
all 
to 
the
fact.

"Prince 
Vasili 
arrived 
in 
Moscow 
yesterday. 
I 
hear 
he 
has 
come 
on
some 
inspection 
business," 
remarked 
the 
visitor.

"Yes, 
but 
between 
ourselves," 
said 
the 
princess, 
"that 
is 
a
pretext. 
The 
fact 
is<p>
he 
has 
come 
to 
see 
Count 
Cyril 
Vladimirovich,
hearing 
how 
ill 
he 
is."

"But 
do 
you 
know, 
my 
dear, 
that 
was 
a 
capital 
joke," 
said 
the 
count;
and 
seeing 
that 
the 
elder 
visitor 
was 
not 
listening, 
he 
turned 
<a href="/aVzUge/zJ4UDh7Nz3s.html">to</a> 
the
young 
ladies. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/RA1HAJD2FWU8mcR.html">"I</a> 
can 
just 
imagine 
what 
a 
funny 
figure 
that 
policeman
cut!"

And 
as 
he 
waved 
his 
arms 
to 
impersonate 
the 
policeman, 
his 
portly 
form
again 
shook 
with 
a 
deep 
ringing 
laugh, 
the 
laugh 
of 
one 
who 
always 
eats
well 
and, 
in 
particular, 
drinks 
well. 
"So 
do 
come 
and 
dine 
with 
us!"
he 
said.





CHAPTER 
XI

Silence 
ensued. 
The 
countess 
looked 
at 
her 
callers, 
smiling 
affably,
but 
not 
concealing 
the 
fact 
that 
she 
would 
not 
be 
distressed 
if 
they
now 
rose 
and 
took 
their 
leave. 
The 
visitor's 
daughter 
was 
already
smoothing 
down 
her 
dress 
with 
an 
inquiring 
look 
at 
her 
mother, 
when
suddenly 
from 
the 
next 
room<p>
were 
heard 
the 
footsteps 
of 
boys 
and 
girls
running 
to 
the 
door 
and 
the 
noise 
of 
a 
chair 
falling 
over, 
and 
a 
girl
of 
thirteen, 
hiding<p>
something 
in 
the 
folds 
of 
her 
short 
muslin 
frock,
darted 
in 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/MLv29oRCc2bju.html">stopped</a> 
short 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room. 
It 
was 
evident
that 
she 
had 
not 
intended 
her 
flight 
to 
bring 
her 
so 
far. 
Behind 
her 
in
the 
doorway 
appeared 
a 
student 
with 
a 
crimson 
coat 
collar, 
an 
officer
of 
the 
Guards, 
a 
girl 
of 
fifteen, 
and 
a 
plump 
rosy-faced 
boy 
in 
a 
short
jacket.

The 
count 
jumped 
up 
and, 
swaying 
from 
side 
to 
side, 
spread 
his 
arms 
wide
and 
threw 
them 
round 
the 
little 
girl 
who 
had 
run 
in.

"Ah, 
here 
she 
is!" 
he 
exclaimed 
laughing. 
"My 
pet, 
whose 
name 
day
it 
is. 
My 
dear 
pet!"

"Ma 
chere, 
there 
is 
a 
time 
for<p>
everything," 
said 
the 
countess 
with
feigned 
severity. 
<a href="/cZl/pX1Xjv6mGGRm7rq.html">"You</a> 
spoil 
her, 
Ilya," 
she 
added, 
turning 
to 
her
husband.

"How 
do 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/YF7ON4J4HI.html">you</a> 
do, 
my 
dear? 
I 
wish 
you 
many 
happy 
returns 
of 
your 
name
day," 
said 
the 
visitor. 
"What 
a 
charming 
child," 
she 
added,
addressing 
the 
mother.

This 
black-eyed, 
wide-mouthed 
girl, 
not 
pretty 
but 
full 
of 
life-with
childish 
bare 
shoulders 
which 
after 
her 
run 
heaved 
and 
shook 
her
bodice, 
with 
black
