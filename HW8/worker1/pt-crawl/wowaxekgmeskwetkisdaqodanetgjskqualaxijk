<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tE7ieWTn13oC.html">her,</a> 
how 
afraid 
I 
am!" 
said 
the 
countess,
not 
realizing 
to 
whom 
she 
was 
speaking. 
Her 
maternal 
instinct 
told 
her
that 
Natasha 
had 
too 
much 
of 
something, 
and 
that 
because 
of 
this
she 
would 
not 
be 
happy. 
Before 
Natasha 
had 
finished 
singing,
fourteen-year-old 
Petya 
rushed 
in 
delightedly, 
to 
say 
that 
some 
mummers
had 
arrived.

Natasha 
stopped 
abruptly.

"Idiot!" 
she 
screamed 
at 
her 
brother 
and, 
running 
to 
a 
chair, 
threw
herself 
on 
it, 
sobbing 
so 
violently 
that 
she 
could 
not 
stop 
for 
a 
long
time.

"It's 
nothing, 
Mamma, 
really 
it's 
nothing; 
only 
Petya 
startled
me," 
she 
said, 
trying 
to 
smile, 
but 
her 
tears 
still 
flowed 
and 
sobs
still 
choked 
her.

The 
mummers 
(some 
of 
the 
house 
serfs) 
dressed 
up 
as 
bears, 
Turks,
innkeepers, 
and 
ladies-frightening 
and 
funny-bringing 
in 
with
them 
the 
cold 
from 
outside 
and 
a 
feeling 
of 
gaiety, 
crowded, 
at 
first
timidly, 
into 
the 
anteroom, 
then 
hiding 
behind 
one 
another 
they 
pushed
into 
the 
ballroom 
where, 
shyly 
at 
first 
and 
then 
more 
and 
more 
merrily
and 
heartily, 
they 
started 
singing, 
dancing, 
and 
playing 
Christmas
games. 
The 
countess, 
when 
she 
had 
identified 
them 
and 
laughed 
at 
their
costumes, 
went 
into 
the 
drawing 
room. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/fh7Z0CKY5iw.html">The</a> 
count 
sat 
in 
the 
ballroom,
smiling 
radiantly 
and 
applauding 
the 
players.<p>
The 
young 
people 
had
disappeared.

Half 
an 
hour 
later 
there<p>
appeared 
among 
the 
other 
mummers 
in 
the
ballroom 
an 
old 
lady 
in 
a 
hooped 
skirt-this 
was 
Nicholas. 
A 
Turkish
girl 
was 
Petya.<p>
A 
clown 
was 
Dimmler. 
An 
hussar 
was 
Natasha, 
and 
a
Circassian 
was 
Sonya 
with 
burnt-cork 
mustache 
and 
eyebrows.

After 
the 
condescending 
surprise, 
nonrecognition, 
and 
praise, 
from 
those
who 
were 
not 
themselves 
dressed 
up, 
the 
young 
people 
decided 
that<p>
their
costumes 
were 
so 
good 
that 
they 
ought 
to 
be<p>
shown 
elsewhere.

Nicholas, 
who, 
as 
the 
roads 
were 
in 
splendid 
condition, 
wanted 
to 
take
them 
all 
for 
a 
drive 
in 
his 
troyka, 
proposed 
to 
take 
with 
them 
about 
a
dozen 
of 
the 
serf 
mummers 
and 
drive 
to 
"Uncle's."

"No, 
why 
disturb 
the 
old 
fellow?" 
said 
the 
countess. 
"Besides,
you 
wouldn't 
have 
room 
to 
turn 
round 
there. 
If 
you 
must 
go,
