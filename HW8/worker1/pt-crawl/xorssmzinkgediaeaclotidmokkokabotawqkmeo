Why 
ask</h1>me?" 
said 
he. 
"Why, 
you 
yourselves 
know
everything 
better 
than 
I 
do."

But 
when 
Volkonski 
said, 
with 
a 
frown, 
that 
it 
was 
in 
the 
Emperor's 
name
that 
he 
asked 
his 
opinion, 
Pfuel 
rose 
and, 
suddenly 
growing 
animated,
began 
to 
speak:

"Everything 
has 
been 
spoiled, 
everything 
muddled, 
everybody 
thought 
they
knew 
better 
than 
I 
did, 
and 
now 
you 
come 
to 
me! 
How 
mend 
matters? 
There
is 
nothing 
to 
mend! 
The 
principles 
laid 
down 
by 
me 
must 
be 
strictly
adhered 
to," 
said 
he, 
drumming 
on 
the 
table 
with 
his 
bony 
fingers. 
"What
is 
the 
difficulty? 
Nonsense, 
childishness!"

He 
went 
up 
to 
the 
map 
and 
speaking 
rapidly 
began 
proving 
that 
no
eventuality 
could 
alter 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
Drissa 
camp, 
that
everything 
had 
been 
foreseen, 
and 
that 
if 
the 
enemy 
were 
really 
going 
to
outflank 
it, 
the 
enemy 
would 
inevitably 
be 
destroyed.

Paulucci, 
who 
did 
not 
know 
German, 
began 
questioning 
him 
in 
French.
Wolzogen 
came 
to 
the 
assistance 
of 
his 
chief, 
who 
spoke 
French 
badly,
and 
began 
translating 
for 
him, 
hardly 
able 
to 
keep 
pace 
with 
Pfuel,
