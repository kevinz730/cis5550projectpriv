into 
the 
tent.

"Well, 
Rapp,</h1>do 
you 
think 
we 
shall 
do<p>
good 
business 
today?" 
Napoleon
asked 
him.

"Without 
doubt, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/BO6oC2Dj6INZ.html">sire,"</a> 
replied 
Rapp.

Napoleon 
looked 
at 
him.

"Do 
you 
remember, 
sire, 
what 
you 
did 
me 
the 
honor 
to 
say 
at 
Smolensk?"
continued 
Rapp. 
"The 
wine 
is 
drawn 
and 
must 
be 
drunk."

Napoleon 
frowned 
and 
sat 
silent 
for 
a 
long 
time 
leaning 
his 
head 
on 
his
hand.

"This 
poor 
army!" 
he 
suddenly 
remarked. 
"It 
has 
diminished 
greatly 
since
Smolensk. 
Fortune 
is 
frankly 
a 
courtesan, 
Rapp. 
I 
have 
always 
said 
so
and 
I 
am 
beginning 
to 
experience 
it. 
But 
the 
Guards, 
Rapp, 
the 
Guards
are 
intact?" 
he 
remarked 
interrogatively.

"Yes, 
sire," 
replied 
Rapp.

Napoleon 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bS3VwPy09.html">took</a> 
a 
lozenge, 
put 
it 
in 
his 
mouth, 
<a href="/cZl/JR9hsJDK48lOZ.html">and</a> 
glanced 
at<p>
his 
watch.
He 
was 
not 
sleepy 
and 
it 
was 
still 
not 
nearly 
morning. 
It 
was 
impossible
to 
give 
further 
orders 
for 
the 
sake 
of 
killing 
time, 
for 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/HAJ1fPTu5.html">orders</a> 
had
all 
been 
given 
and 
were 
now 
being 
executed.

"Have 
the 
biscuits 
and 
rice 
been 
served 
out 
to 
the 
regiments 
of 
the
Guards?" 
asked 
Napoleon 
sternly.

"Yes, 
sire."

"The 
rice 
too?"

Rapp 
replied 
that 
he 
had 
<a href="/cZl/AX7CiG5ioN4DLq.html">given</a> 
the 
Emperor's 
order 
about 
the 
rice, 
but
Napoleon 
shook 
his 
head 
in 
dissatisfaction 
as 
if 
not 
believing 
that
his 
order 
had 
been 
executed. 
An 
attendant 
came 
in 
with 
punch. 
Napoleon
ordered 
another 
glass 
to 
be 
brought 
for 
Rapp, 
and 
silently 
sipped 
his
own.

"I 
have 
neither 
taste 
nor 
smell," 
he 
remarked, 
sniffing 
at 
his 
glass.
"This 
cold 
is 
tiresome. 
They 
talk 
about 
medicine-what 
is 
the 
good 
of
medicine 
when 
it 
can't 
cure 
a 
cold! 
Corvisart 
gave 
me 
these 
lozenges 
but
they 
don't 
help 
at 
all. 
What 
can 
doctors 
cure? 
One 
can't 
cure 
anything.
Our 
body 
is 
a 
machine 
for 
living. 
It 
is 
organized 
for 
that, 
it 
is 
its
nature. 
Let 
life 
go 
on 
in 
it 
unhindered 
and 
let<p>
it 
defend 
itself, 
it
will 
do 
more 
than 
if 
you 
paralyze 
it 
by 
encumbering 
it 
with 
remedies.
Our 
body 
is 
like 
a 
perfect 
watch 
that 
should 
go
