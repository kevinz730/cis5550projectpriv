the 
company</h1>went 
into 
the 
sitting 
room 
and 
Princess 
Mary 
was
asked 
to 
play 
on 
the 
clavichord. 
Anatole, 
laughing 
and 
in 
high 
spirits,
came 
and 
leaned 
on 
his 
elbows, 
facing 
her 
and 
beside 
Mademoiselle
Bourienne. 
Princess 
Mary 
felt 
his 
look 
with 
a 
painfully 
joyous 
emotion.
Her 
favorite 
sonata 
bore 
her 
into 
a 
most 
intimately 
poetic 
world 
and
the 
look 
she 
felt 
upon 
her 
made 
that 
world 
still 
more<p>
poetic. 
But
Anatole's 
expression, 
though 
his 
eyes 
were 
fixed 
on 
her, 
referred 
not
to 
her 
but 
to 
the 
movements 
of 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne's 
little
foot, 
which 
he 
was 
then 
touching 
with 
his 
own 
under 
the 
clavichord.
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
was 
also 
looking 
at 
Princess 
Mary, 
and 
in 
her
lovely 
eyes 
there 
was 
a 
look 
of 
fearful 
joy 
and 
hope 
that 
was 
also 
new
to 
the 
princess.

"How 
she 
loves<p>
me!" 
thought 
Princess 
Mary. 
"How<p>
happy 
I 
am 
now,
and 
how 
happy 
I 
may 
be 
with 
such 
a 
friend 
and 
such 
a 
husband! 
Husband?
Can 
it 
be 
possible?" 
she 
thought, 
not 
daring 
to 
look 
at 
his 
face, 
but
still 
feeling 
his 
eyes 
gazing 
at 
her.

In 
the 
evening, 
after 
supper, 
when 
all 
were 
about 
to 
retire, 
Anatole
kissed 
Princess 
Mary's 
hand. 
She 
did 
not 
know 
how 
she 
found 
the
courage, 
but 
she 
looked 
straight 
into 
his 
handsome<p>
face 
as 
it 
came 
near
to 
her 
shortsighted 
eyes. 
Turning 
from 
Princess 
Mary 
he 
went 
up 
and
kissed 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne's 
hand. 
(This 
was 
not 
etiquette, 
but
then 
he 
did 
everything 
so 
simply 
and 
with 
such 
assurance!) 
Mademoiselle
Bourienne 
flushed, 
and 
gave 
the 
princess 
a 
frightened 
look.

"What 
delicacy!" 
thought 
the 
princess. 
"Is 
it 
possible 
that
Amelie" 
(Mademoiselle 
Bourienne) 
"thinks 
I 
could 
be 
jealous 
of 
her,
and 
not 
value 
her 
pure 
affection 
and 
devotion 
to 
me?" 
She 
went 
up
to 
her 
and 
kissed 
her 
warmly. 
Anatole 
went 
up 
to<p>
kiss 
the 
little
princess' 
hand.

"No!<p>
No! 
No! 
When 
your 
father 
writes 
to 
tell 
me 
that 
you 
are 
behaving
well 
I 
will 
give 
you 
my 
hand 
to 
kiss. 
Not 
till 
then!" 
she 
said. 
And
smilingly 
raising 
a 
finger 
at 
him, 
she 
left 
the 
room.

They 
all 
separated, 
but, 
except 
Anatole 
who 
fell 
asleep 
as 
soon 
as 
he
got 
into 
bed, 
all 
kept 
awake 
a 
long 
time 
that 
night.
