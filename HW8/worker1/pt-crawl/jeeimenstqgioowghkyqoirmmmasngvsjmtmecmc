the
coming 
movement 
and 
bear 
the 
responsibility 
for 
all 
that 
had 
to

A 
man 
without 
convictions, 
without 
habits, 
without 
traditions, 
without
a 
name, 
and 
not 
even 
a 
Frenchman, 
emerges-by 
what 
seem 
the 
strangest
chances-from 
among

military 
fame. 
Innumerable 
so-called 
chances
accompany 
him 
everywhere. 
The 
disfavor 
into 
which 
he 
falls
