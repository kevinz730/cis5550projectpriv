through 
the 
crowd
behind</h1>a<p>
liveried 
footman 
who 
cleared 
the 
way 
for 
them, 
she 
heard 
a
young 
man 
speaking 
about 
her 
in 
too 
loud 
a 
whisper.

"That's 
Rostova, 
the 
one 
who..."

"She's 
much 
thinner, 
but 
all 
the 
same 
she's 
pretty!"

She 
heard, 
or 
thought 
she 
heard, 
the 
names 
of 
Kuragin 
and 
Bolkonski. 
But
she 
was 
always 
imagining 
that. 
It 
always 
seemed 
to 
her 
that 
everyone
who 
looked 
at 
her 
was 
thinking 
only 
of 
what 
had 
happened 
to 
her. 
With 
a
sinking 
heart, 
wretched 
as 
she 
always 
was 
now 
when 
she 
found 
herself
in 
a 
crowd, 
Natasha 
in 
her 
lilac 
silk 
dress 
trimmed 
with 
black 
lace
walked-as 
women 
can 
walk-with 
the 
more 
repose 
and 
stateliness 
the
greater 
the 
pain 
and 
shame 
in 
her 
soul. 
She 
knew 
for 
certain 
that 
she
was 
pretty, 
but 
this 
no 
longer 
gave 
her 
satisfaction 
as 
it 
used 
to.
On 
the 
contrary 
it 
tormented 
her 
more 
than 
anything 
else 
of 
late, 
and
particularly 
so 
on 
this 
bright, 
hot 
summer 
day 
in 
town. 
"It's 
Sunday
again-another 
week 
past," 
she 
thought, 
recalling 
that 
she 
had 
been 
here
the 
Sunday 
before, 
"and 
always 
the 
same 
life 
that 
is 
no 
life, 
and 
the
same 
surroundings 
in 
which 
it 
used 
to 
be 
so 
easy 
to 
live. 
I'm 
pretty,
I'm 
young, 
and 
I 
know 
that 
now 
I 
am 
good. 
I 
used 
to 
be 
bad, 
but 
now 
I
know 
I 
am 
good," 
she 
thought, 
"but 
yet 
my 
best 
years 
are 
slipping 
by
and 
are 
no 
good 
to 
anyone." 
She 
stood 
by 
her 
mother's 
side 
and 
exchanged
nods 
with 
acquaintances 
near 
her. 
From 
habit 
she 
scrutinized 
the 
ladies'
dresses, 
condemned 
the 
bearing 
of 
a 
lady 
standing 
close 
by 
who 
was 
not
crossing 
herself 
properly 
but 
in 
a 
cramped 
manner, 
and 
again 
she 
thought
with 
vexation 
that 
she 
was 
herself 
being 
judged 
and 
was 
judging 
others,
and 
suddenly, 
at 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
service, 
she 
felt 
horrified 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Mv1Gj01OpC.html">at</a> 
her<p>
own
vileness, 
horrified 
that 
the 
former 
purity 
of 
her 
soul 
was 
again 
lost 
to
her.

A 
comely, 
fresh-looking 
old 
man 
was 
conducting 
the 
service 
with 
that
mild 
solemnity 
which 
has 
so 
elevating 
and 
soothing 
an 
effect 
on 
the
souls 
of 
the 
worshipers. 
The 
gates 
of 
the 
sanctuary 
screen 
were 
closed,
the 
curtain 
was 
slowly 
drawn, 
and 
from 
behind 
it 
a 
soft 
mysterious 
voice
pronounced 
some 
words. 
Tears, 
the 
cause 
of 
which 
she 
herself 
did 
not
understand, 
made 
Natasha's 
breast 
heave, 
and 
a 
joyous 
but 
oppressive
feeling 
agitated 
her.

"Teach 
me 
what 
I 
should 
do, 
how 
to 
live 
my 
life, 
how 
I 
may 
grow 
good
forever, 
forever!" 
she 
pleaded.

The 
deacon 
came 
out 
onto 
the 
raised 
space 
before 
the 
altar 
screen 
and,
holding 
his 
thumb 
extended, 
drew 
his 
long 
hair 
from 
under 
his 
dalmatic
and, 
making 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
cross 
on 
his 
breast, 
began 
in 
a 
loud 
and
solemn 
voice 
to 
recite 
the 
words 
of 
the 
prayer....

"In 
peace 
let 
us 
pray 
unto 
the 
Lord."

"As 
one 
community, 
without 
distinction 
of 
class, 
without 
enmity, 
united
by 
brotherly 
love-let 
us 
pray!" 
thought 
Natasha.

"For<p>
the 
peace 
that 
is 
from 
above, 
and 
for 
the 
salvation 
of 
our 
souls."

"For 
the 
world 
of 
angels 
and 
all 
the 
spirits 
who 
dwell 
above 
us," 
prayed
Natasha.

When 
they 
prayed 
for 
the 
warriors, 
she 
thought<p>
of 
her 
brother 
and
Denisov. 
When 
they 
prayed 
for 
all 
traveling 
by 
land 
and 
sea, 
she
remembered 
Prince 
Andrew, 
prayed 
for 
him, 
and 
asked 
God 
to 
forgive 
her
all 
the 
wrongs 
she 
had 
done 
him. 
When 
they 
prayed 
for 
those 
who 
love 
us,
she 
prayed 
for 
the 
members 
of 
her 
own 
family, 
her 
father 
and 
mother 
and
Sonya, 
realizing 
for 
the 
first 
time 
how 
wrongly 
she 
had 
acted
