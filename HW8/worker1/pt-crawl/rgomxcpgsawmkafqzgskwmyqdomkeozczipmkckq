to 
love 
God.</h1>Harder 
and 
more 
blessed
than 
all 
else 
is 
to 
love 
this 
life 
in 
one's 
sufferings, 
in 
innocent
sufferings."

"Karataev!" 
came 
to 
Pierre's 
mind.

And 
suddenly 
he 
saw 
vividly 
before 
him 
a 
long-forgotten, 
kindly 
old 
man
who 
had 
given 
him 
geography 
lessons 
in 
Switzerland. 
"Wait 
a 
bit," 
said
the 
old<p>
man, 
and 
showed 
Pierre 
a 
globe. 
This 
globe 
was 
alive-a 
vibrating
ball 
without 
fixed 
dimensions. 
Its 
whole 
surface 
consisted 
of 
drops
closely 
pressed 
together, 
and 
all 
these 
drops 
moved 
and 
changed 
places,
sometimes 
several 
of 
them 
merging 
into 
one, 
sometimes 
one 
dividing
into 
many. 
Each 
drop 
tried 
to 
spread 
out 
and 
occupy 
as 
much 
space 
as
possible, 
but 
others 
striving 
to 
do 
the 
same 
compressed 
it, 
sometimes
destroyed 
it, 
and 
sometimes 
merged 
with 
it.

"That 
is 
life," 
said 
the 
old 
teacher.

"How 
simple 
and 
clear 
it 
is," 
thought 
Pierre. 
"How 
is 
it 
I 
did 
not 
know
it 
before?"

"God 
is 
in 
the 
midst, 
and 
each 
drop 
tries 
to 
expand 
so 
as 
to 
reflect
Him 
to 
the 
greatest 
extent. 
And 
it 
grows, 
merges, 
disappears 
from 
the
surface, 
sinks 
to 
the 
depths, 
and 
again 
emerges.<p>
There 
now, 
Karataev
has 
spread 
out 
and 
disappeared. 
Do 
you 
understand, 
my 
child?" 
said 
the
teacher.

"Do 
you 
understand, 
damn 
you?" 
shouted 
a 
voice, 
and 
Pierre 
woke 
up.

He 
lifted 
himself 
and 
sat 
up. 
A 
Frenchman 
who 
had 
just 
pushed 
a 
Russian
soldier 
away 
was 
squatting 
by 
the 
fire, 
engaged 
in 
roasting 
a<p>
piece
of 
meat 
stuck 
on 
a 
ramrod. 
His 
sleeves 
were 
rolled 
up 
and 
his 
sinewy,
hairy, 
red 
hands 
with 
their 
short 
fingers 
deftly 
turned 
the 
ramrod. 
His
brown 
morose 
face 
with 
frowning 
brows 
was 
clearly 
visible 
by 
the 
glow 
of
the 
charcoal.

"It's 
all 
the 
same 
to 
him," 
he 
muttered, 
turning 
quickly 
to 
a 
soldier
who 
stood 
behind 
him. 
"Brigand! 
Get 
away!"

And 
twisting 
the 
ramrod 
he 
looked 
gloomily 
at 
Pierre, 
who 
turned
away 
and 
gazed 
into 
the 
darkness. 
A 
prisoner, 
the 
Russian 
soldier 
the
Frenchman 
had 
pushed 
away, 
was 
sitting 
near 
the 
fire 
patting 
something
with 
his 
hand. 
Looking 
more 
closely<p>
Pierre 
recognized 
the 
blue-gray 
dog,
sitting 
beside 
the 
soldier, 
wagging 
its 
tail.

"Ah, 
he's 
come?" 
said 
Pierre. 
"And 
Plat-" 
he 
began, 
but 
did 
not 
finish.

Suddenly 
and 
simultaneously 
a 
crowd 
of<p>
memories 
awoke 
in 
his 
fancy-of
the 
look 
Platon 
had 
given 
him 
as 
he 
sat 
under 
the 
tree, 
of 
the 
shot
heard 
from 
that 
spot, 
of 
the 
dog's 
howl, 
of 
the 
guilty 
faces 
of 
the 
two
Frenchmen 
as 
they 
ran 
past 
him, 
of 
the 
lowered 
and 
smoking 
gun, 
and 
of
Karataev's 
absence 
at 
this 
halt-and 
he 
was 
on 
the 
point 
of 
realizing
that 
<a href="/cZl/Je29s0aAcKW.html">Karataev</a> 
had 
been 
killed, 
but 
just 
at 
<a href="/nocrawl/aVzUge/oFc40ZkSv8ErZgX.html">that</a> 
instant, 
he 
knew 
not
why, 
the 
recollection 
came 
to 
his 
mind 
of 
a 
summer 
evening 
he 
had 
spent
with 
a 
beautiful 
Polish 
lady 
on 
the 
veranda 
of 
his 
house 
in 
Kiev. 
And
without 
linking 
up 
the 
events 
of 
the 
day 
or 
drawing 
a 
conclusion
from 
them, 
Pierre 
closed 
his 
eyes, 
seeing 
a 
vision 
of 
the 
country 
in
summertime 
mingled 
with 
memories 
of 
bathing 
and 
of 
the 
liquid, 
vibrating
globe, 
and 
he 
sank 
into 
water 
so 
that 
it 
closed 
over 
his 
head.

Before 
sunrise 
he 
was 
awakened 
by 
shouts 
and 
loud 
and 
rapid 
firing.
French 
soldiers 
were 
running 
past 
him.

"The 
Cossacks!" 
one 
of 
them 
shouted, 
and 
a 
moment 
later 
a 
crowd 
of
Russians 
surrounded 
Pierre.

For 
a 
long 
time 
he 
could 
not 
understand 
what 
was 
happening 
to 
him. 
All
around 
he 
heard 
his 
comrades 
sobbing 
with 
joy.

"Brothers! 
Dear 
fellows! 
Darlings!" 
old 
soldiers 
exclaimed, 
weeping, 
as
they<p>
embraced 
Cossacks 
and 
hussars.

The 
hussars 
and 
Cossacks 
crowded 
round 
the 
prisoners; 
one 
offered 
them
clothes, 
another 
boots, 
and<p>
a 
third 
bread. 
Pierre 
sobbed 
as 
he 
sat
among 
them 
and 
could 
not 
utter 
a 
word. 
He 
hugged 
the 
first 
soldier 
who
approached 
him, 
and 
kissed 
him, 
weeping.

Dolokhov 
stood 
at 
the 
gate 
of 
the 
ruined 
house, 
letting 
a 
crowd
of 
disarmed 
Frenchmen 
pass 
by.
