many. 
In 
Russia 
there
was 
an 
Emperor, 
Alexander, 
who 
decided 
to 
restore 
order 
in 
Europe 
and
therefore 
fought 
against 
Napoleon. 
In 
1807 
he 
suddenly 
made 
friends
with 
him, 
but 
in 
1811 
they 
again 
quarreled 
and 
again 
began 
killing 
many
people. 
Napoleon 
led 
six 
hundred 
thousand 
men 
into 
Russia 
and 
captured
Moscow; 
then 
he 
suddenly 
ran 
away 
from 
Moscow, 
and 
the 
Emperor
Alexander, 
helped 
by 
the 
advice 
of 
Stein 
and<p>
others, 
united 
Europe 
to
arm 
against 
the 
disturber 
of 
its 
peace. 
All 
Napoleon's 
allies 
suddenly
became 
his 
enemies 
and 
their 
forces 
advanced 
against 
the 
fresh 
forces 
he
raised. 
The<p>
Allies 
defeated 
Napoleon, 
entered 
Paris, 
forced 
Napoleon 
to
abdicate, 
and 
sent 
him 
to 
the 
island 
of 
Elba, 
not 
depriving 
<a href="/cZl/omA43bOIDr7tjjJI.html">him</a> 
of 
the
title 
of 
Emperor 
and 
showing 
him 
every 
respect, 
though<p>
five 
years 
before
and 
one 
year 
later 
they 
all 
regarded 
him 
as 
an 
outlaw 
and 
a 
brigand.
Then 
Louis 
XVIII, 
who 
till 
then 
had 
been 
the 
laughingstock 
both 
of 
the
French 
and 
the 
Allies, 
began 
to 
reign. 
And 
Napoleon, 
shedding 
tears
before 
his 
Old 
Guards, 
renounced 
the 
throne 
and 
went 
into 
exile. 
Then
the 
skillful 
statesmen 
and 
diplomatists 
(especially 
Talleyrand, 
who
managed 
to 
sit 
down 
in<p>
a 
particular 
chair 
before 
anyone 
else 
and
thereby 
extended 
the 
frontiers 
of 
France) 
talked 
in 
Vienna 
and 
by
these 
conversations 
made 
the 
nations 
happy 
or 
unhappy. 
Suddenly 
the
diplomatists 
and 
monarchs 
nearly 
quarreled 
and 
were 
on 
the 
point 
of
again 
ordering 
their 
armies 
to 
kill 
one 
another, 
but 
just 
then 
Napoleon
arrived 
in 
France 
with 
a 
battalion, 
and 
the 
French, 
who 
had 
been 
hating
him, 
immediately 
all 
submitted 
to 
him. 
But 
the 
Allied 
monarchs 
were
angry 
at 
this 
and 
went 
to 
fight 
the 
French 
once 
more. 
And 
they 
defeated
the 
genius 
Napoleon 
and, 
suddenly 
recognizing 
him 
as 
a 
brigand, 
sent 
him
to 
the 
island 
of 
St. 
Helena. 
And 
the 
exile, 
separated 
from 
the 
beloved
France 
so 
dear 
to 
his 
heart, 
died 
a 
lingering 
death 
on 
that 
rock 
and
bequeathed 
his 
great 
deeds 
to 
posterity. 
But 
in 
Europe<p>
a 
reaction
occurred 
and 
the 
sovereigns 
once 
again 
all 
began 
to 
oppress 
their
subjects."

It 
would 
be 
a 
mistake 
to 
think 
that 
this 
is 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jbn1GBzwy5Bxal6mAz.html">ironic-a</a> 
caricature 
of 
the
historical 
accounts. 
On 
the 
contrary 
it 
is 
a 
very 
mild 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oX6yf9Cr1gAzo.html">expression</a> 
of
the 
contradictory 
replies, 
not 
meeting 
the 
questions, 
which 
all 
the
historians 
give, 
from 
the 
compilers 
of 
memoirs 
and 
the 
histories
of 
separate 
states 
to 
the 
writers 
of 
general 
histories 
and 
the 
new
histories 
of 
the 
culture 
of 
that 
period.

The 
strangeness 
and 
absurdity 
of 
these 
replies 
arise 
from 
the 
fact 
that
modern 
history, 
<a href="/aVzUge/iO7a8G9LgATt.html">like</a> 
a 
deaf 
man, 
answers 
questions 
no 
one 
has 
asked.

If 
the 
purpose 
of 
history 
be 
to 
give 
a 
description 
of 
the 
movement 
of
humanity 
and 
of 
the 
peoples, 
the 
first 
<a href="/cZl/up8XKBx4Nw9.html">question-in</a> 
the 
absence 
of 
a
reply 
to 
which 
all 
the 
rest 
will 
be 
incomprehensible-is: 
what 
is 
the
power 
that 
moves 
peoples? 
To 
this, 
modern 
history 
laboriously 
replies
either 
that 
Napoleon 
was 
a 
great 
genius, 
or 
that 
Louis 
XIV 
was 
very
proud, 
or 
that 
certain 
writers 
wrote 
certain 
books.

All 
that 
may 
be 
so 
and 
mankind 
is 
ready 
to 
agree 
with 
it, 
but 
it 
is 
not
what 
was 
asked. 
All 
that 
would 
be 
interesting 
if 
we 
recognized 
a 
divine
power 
based 
on 
itself 
and 
always 
consistently 
directing 
its 
nations
through 
Napoleons, 
Louis-es, 
and 
writers; 
but 
we 
do 
not 
acknowledge 
such
a 
power, 
and
