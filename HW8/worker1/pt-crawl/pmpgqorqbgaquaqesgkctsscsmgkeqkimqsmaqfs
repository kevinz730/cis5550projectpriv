be 
sure 
to 
be 
better 
than 
Mamonov's."

"Oh, 
don't 
talk 
to 
me<p>
of 
my 
regiment," 
replied 
Pierre, 
kissing 
his
hostess' 
hand 
and 
taking 
a 
seat 
beside 
her. 
"I 
am 
so 
sick 
of 
it."

"You 
will, 
of 
course, 
command 
it 
yourself?" 
said 
Julie, 
directing 
a 
sly,
sarcastic 
glance 
toward 
the 
militia 
officer.

The 
latter 
in 
Pierre's 
presence 
had 
ceased 
to 
be 
caustic, 
and 
his 
face
expressed 
perplexity 
as 
to 
what 
Julie's 
smile<p>
might 
mean. 
In 
spite 
of
his 
absent-mindedness 
and 
good 
nature, 
Pierre's 
personality 
immediately
checked 
any 
attempt 
to 
ridicule 
him 
to 
his 
face.

"No," 
said 
Pierre, 
with 
a 
laughing 
glance 
at 
his 
big, 
stout 
body. 
"I
should 
make 
too 
good 
a 
target 
for 
the 
French, 
besides 
I 
am 
afraid 
I
should 
hardly 
be 
able 
to 
climb 
onto 
a 
horse."

Among 
those 
whom 
Julie's 
guests 
happened 
to 
choose 
to 
gossip 
<a href="/aVzUge/GL6CNkX5CS0ugXx.html">about</a> 
were
the 
Rostovs.

"I 
hear 
that 
their 
affairs 
are 
in 
a 
very 
bad 
way," 
said 
Julie. 
"And 
he
is 
so 
unreasonable, 
the 
count 
himself 
I 
mean. 
The 
Razumovskis 
wanted
to 
buy 
his 
house 
and 
his 
estate 
near 
Moscow, 
but 
it 
drags 
on 
and 
on. 
He
asks 
too 
much."

"No, 
I 
think 
the 
sale 
will 
come 
off 
in 
a 
few 
days," 
said 
someone.
"Though 
it 
is 
madness 
to 
buy 
anything 
in 
Moscow 
now."

"Why?" 
asked 
Julie. 
"You 
don't 
think 
Moscow 
is 
in 
danger?"

"Then 
why 
are 
you 
leaving?"

"I? 
What 
<a href="/cZl/cw87WUlt8Sgza.html">a</a> 
question! 
I 
am 
going 
because... 
well, 
because 
everyone 
is
going: 
and 
besides-I 
am 
not 
Joan 
of 
Arc 
or 
an 
Amazon."

"Well, 
of 
course,<p>
of 
course! 
Let 
me 
have 
some 
more 
strips 
of 
linen."

"If 
he 
manages 
the 
business 
properly 
he 
will 
be 
able 
to 
pay 
off 
all 
his
debts," 
said 
the 
militia 
officer, 
speaking 
of 
Rostov.

"A 
kindly 
old 
man 
but 
not 
up 
to 
much. 
And 
why 
do 
they 
stay 
on 
so 
long 
in
Moscow? 
They 
meant 
to 
leave 
for 
the 
country 
long 
ago. 
Natalie 
is 
quite
well 
again 
now, 
isn't 
she?" 
Julie 
asked 
Pierre 
with 
a 
knowing 
smile.

"They 
are 
waiting 
for 
their 
younger 
son," 
Pierre 
replied. 
"He 
joined
Obolenski's 
Cossacks 
and 
went 
to 
Belaya 
Tserkov 
where 
the 
regiment 
is
being 
formed. 
But 
now 
they 
have 
had 
him 
transferred 
to 
my 
regiment 
and
are 
expecting 
him 
every 
day. 
The 
count 
wanted 
to 
leave 
long 
ago, 
but 
the
countess 
won't 
on 
any 
account 
leave 
Moscow 
till 
her 
son 
returns."
