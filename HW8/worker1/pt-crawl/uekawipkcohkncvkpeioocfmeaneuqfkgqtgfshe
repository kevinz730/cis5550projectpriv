she. 
"I 
never 
wanted 
anything
and</h1>I 
don't 
now."

She 
pushed 
the 
little 
dog 
off 
her 
lap 
and 
smoothed 
her 
dress.

"And 
this 
is 
gratitude-this 
is 
recognition 
for 
those 
who 
have
sacrificed 
everything 
for 
his 
sake!" 
she 
cried. 
"It's 
splendid!
Fine! 
I 
don't 
want 
anything, 
Prince."

"Yes, 
but 
you 
are 
not 
the 
only 
one. 
There 
are 
your 
sisters..."
replied 
Prince 
Vasili.

But 
the 
princess 
did 
not 
listen 
to 
him.

"Yes, 
I 
knew 
it 
long 
ago 
but 
had 
forgotten. 
I 
knew 
that 
I 
could 
expect
nothing 
but 
meanness, 
deceit, 
envy, 
intrigue, 
and 
ingratitude-the
blackest 
ingratitude-in 
this 
house..."

"Do 
you 
or 
do 
you 
not<p>
know 
where 
that 
will 
is?" 
insisted 
Prince
Vasili, 
his 
cheeks 
twitching 
more 
than 
ever.

"Yes, 
I 
was 
a 
fool! 
I 
still 
believed 
in 
people, 
loved 
them, 
and
sacrificed 
myself. 
But 
only 
the 
base, 
the 
vile 
succeed! 
I 
know 
who 
has
been 
intriguing!"

The 
princess 
wished 
to 
rise, 
but 
the 
prince 
held 
her 
by 
the 
hand. 
She
had 
the 
air 
of 
one 
who 
has 
suddenly 
lost 
faith 
in 
the 
whole<p>
human 
race.
She<p>
gave 
her 
companion 
an 
angry 
glance.

"There 
is 
still 
time, 
my 
dear. 
You 
must 
remember, 
Catiche, 
that 
it 
was
all 
done 
casually 
in 
a 
moment 
of 
anger, 
of 
illness, 
and 
was 
afterwards
forgotten.<p>
Our 
duty, 
my 
dear, 
is 
to 
rectify 
his 
mistake, 
to 
ease 
his
last 
moments 
by 
not 
letting 
him 
commit 
this 
injustice, 
and 
not 
to 
let
him 
die 
feeling 
that 
he 
is 
rendering 
unhappy 
those 
who..."

"Who 
sacrificed 
everything 
for 
him," 
chimed 
in 
the 
princess, 
who
would 
again 
have 
risen 
had 
not 
the 
prince 
still 
held 
her 
fast, 
"though
he 
never 
could 
appreciate 
it. 
No, 
mon 
cousin," 
she 
added 
with 
a 
sigh,
"I 
shall 
always 
remember 
that 
in 
this 
world 
one 
must 
expect 
no 
reward,
that 
in 
this 
world 
there 
is 
neither 
honor 
nor 
justice. 
In 
this 
world 
one
has 
to 
be 
cunning 
and 
cruel."

"Now 
come, 
come! 
Be 
reasonable. 
I 
know 
your 
excellent 
heart."

"No, 
I 
have 
a 
wicked 
heart."

"I 
know 
your 
heart," 
repeated 
the 
prince. 
"I 
value 
your 
friendship
and 
wish 
you 
to 
have 
as 
good 
an 
opinion 
of 
me. 
Don't 
upset 
yourself,
and 
let 
us 
talk<p>
sensibly 
while 
there 
is 
still 
time, 
be 
it 
a 
day 
or 
be 
it
but 
an 
hour.... 
Tell 
me 
all 
you 
know 
about 
the 
will, 
and 
above 
all 
where
it 
is. 
You 
must 
know. 
We 
will 
take 
it 
at 
once 
and 
show 
it 
to 
the
count. 
He 
has, 
no 
doubt, 
forgotten 
it 
and 
will 
wish 
to 
destroy 
it.
You 
understand 
that 
my 
sole 
desire 
is 
conscientiously 
to 
carry 
out 
his
wishes; 
that 
is 
my 
only 
reason 
for 
being 
here. 
I 
came 
simply 
to 
help 
him
and 
you."

"Now 
I 
see 
it 
all! 
I 
know 
who 
has 
been 
intriguing-I 
know!" 
cried
the 
<a href="/cZl/WS4s9kUOXT8j.html">princess.

"That's</a> 
not 
the 
point, 
my 
dear."

"It's 
that 
protege 
of 
yours, 
that 
sweet 
Princess 
Drubetskaya,
that 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
whom 
I 
would 
not 
take 
for 
a 
housemaid... 
the
infamous, 
vile 
woman!"

"Do 
not 
let 
us 
lose 
any 
time..."

"Ah, 
don't 
talk 
to 
me! 
Last 
winter 
she 
wheedled 
herself<p>
in 
here 
and
told 
the 
count 
such 
vile, 
disgraceful 
things 
about 
us, 
especially 
about
Sophie-I 
can't 
repeat 
them-that 
it 
made 
the 
count<p>
quite 
ill 
and 
he
would 
not 
see 
us 
for 
a 
whole 
fortnight. 
I 
know 
it 
was 
then 
he 
wrote 
this
vile, 
infamous 
paper, 
but 
I 
thought 
the 
thing 
was 
invalid."

"We've 
got 
to 
it 
at 
last-why 
did<p>
you 
not 
tell 
me 
about 
it
sooner?"

"It's 
in 
the 
inlaid 
portfolio 
that 
he 
keeps 
under 
his 
pillow,"
said 
the 
princess, 
ignoring 
his 
question. 
"Now 
I 
know! 
Yes; 
if 
I 
have
a 
sin, 
a 
great 
sin, 
it 
is 
hatred 
of 
that 
vile 
<a href="/aVzUge/HAJ1fPTu5.html">woman!"</a> 
almost 
shrieked
the 
princess, 
now 
quite 
changed. 
"And 
what 
does 
she 
come 
worming
herself 
in 
here 
for? 
But 
I 
will 
give 
her 
a 
piece 
of 
my 
mind. 
The 
time
will 
come!"





CHAPTER 
XXII

While 
these 
conversations 
were 
going 
on 
in 
the 
reception 
room 
and 
the
princess' 
room, 
a 
carriage 
containing 
Pierre 
(who 
had 
been 
sent 
for)
and 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
(who 
found 
it 
necessary 
to 
accompany 
him) 
was
driving 
into 
the 
court 
of 
Count 
Bezukhov's 
house. 
As 
the 
wheels
rolled 
softly 
over 
the 
straw 
beneath 
the 
windows,
