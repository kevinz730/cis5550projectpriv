level 
of 
the 
street, 
took 
in 
<a href="/aVzUge/jl2O0Vd6Yg.html">his</a> 
hand 
the
report 
he 
had 
prepared 
for 
the 
Emperor.

There 
was 
running 
to 
and 
fro 
and 
whispering; 
another 
troyka 
flew
furiously 
up, 
and 
then 
all 
eyes 
were 
turned 
on 
an 
approaching 
sleigh
in 
which 
the 
figures 
of 
the 
Emperor 
and 
Volkonski 
could 
already 
be
descried.

From 
the 
habit 
of 
fifty 
years 
all 
this 
had 
a<p>
physically 
agitating 
effect
on 
the 
old 
general. 
He 
<a href="/cZl/XT9mDKi0HwD5ogArh.html">carefully</a> 
and 
hastily 
felt 
himself 
all 
over,
readjusted 
his 
hat, 
and 
pulling 
himself 
together 
drew 
himself 
up 
and,
at 
the 
very 
moment 
when 
the 
Emperor, 
having 
alighted 
from 
the 
sleigh,
lifted 
his 
eyes 
to 
him, 
handed 
him 
the 
report 
and 
began 
speaking 
in 
his
smooth, 
ingratiating 
voice.

The 
Emperor 
with 
a 
rapid 
glance 
scanned 
Kutuzov 
from 
head 
to 
foot,
frowned 
for 
an 
instant, 
but 
immediately 
mastering 
himself 
went 
up 
to 
the
old 
man, 
extended 
his 
arms 
and 
embraced 
him. 
And 
this 
embrace 
too, 
owing
to<p>
a 
long-standing 
impression 
related 
to 
his 
innermost 
feelings, 
had 
its
usual 
effect 
on<p>
Kutuzov 
and 
he<p>
<a href="/cZl/hMv6Ook38xXmhq.html">gave</a> 
a 
sob.

The 
Emperor 
greeted 
the 
officers 
and 
the 
Semenov 
guard, 
and 
again
pressing 
the 
old 
man's 
hand 
went 
with 
him 
into 
the 
castle.

When 
alone 
with 
<a href="/aVzUge/XB1ddue81ujvI.html">the</a> 
field 
marshal 
the 
Emperor 
expressed 
his
dissatisfaction
