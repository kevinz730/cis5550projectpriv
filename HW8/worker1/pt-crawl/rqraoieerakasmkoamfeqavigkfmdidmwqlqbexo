of 
them 
expresses 
his</h1>opinion 
as 
to 
how 
and
where<p>
to 
haul 
it. 
They 
haul 
the 
log 
away, 
and 
it 
happens 
that 
this 
is
done 
as 
one 
of 
them 
said. 
He 
ordered 
it. 
There 
we 
have 
command 
and 
power
in 
their 
primary<p>
form. 
The 
man 
who 
worked 
most 
with 
his 
hands 
could 
not
think 
so 
much 
about 
what 
he 
was 
doing, 
or 
reflect 
on 
or 
command 
what
would 
result 
from 
the 
common 
activity; 
while 
the 
man 
who 
commanded
more 
would 
evidently 
work 
less 
with 
his 
hands 
on 
account 
of 
his 
greater
verbal 
activity.

When 
some 
larger 
concourse 
of 
men 
direct 
their 
activity 
to 
a 
common 
aim
there 
is 
a 
yet 
sharper 
division 
of<p>
those 
who, 
because 
their 
activity 
is
given 
to 
directing 
and 
commanding, 
take 
less 
part 
in 
the 
direct 
work.

When 
a 
man 
works 
alone 
he 
always 
has 
a 
certain 
set 
of 
reflections 
which
as 
it 
seems 
to 
him 
directed 
his 
past 
activity, 
justify 
his 
present
activity, 
and 
guide 
him 
in 
planning 
his 
future 
actions. 
Just 
the 
same 
is
done 
by 
a 
concourse 
of 
people, 
allowing 
those 
who 
do 
not 
take 
a 
direct
part 
in 
the 
activity 
to 
devise 
considerations, 
justifications, 
and
surmises 
concerning 
their 
collective 
<a href="/aVzUge/NP5Url4ODiFp6p.html">activity.

For</a> 
reasons 
known 
or 
unknown 
to 
us 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/rP1Ikp3mbEd7.html">French</a> 
began 
to 
drown 
and 
kill
one 
another. 
And 
corresponding 
to 
the 
event 
its 
justification 
appears<p>
in
people's 
belief 
that 
this 
was 
necessary 
for 
the 
welfare 
of 
France, 
for
liberty, 
and 
for 
equality. 
People 
ceased 
to 
kill 
one 
another, 
and
this 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Uc7hOZs5W6Mm.html">event</a><p>
was 
accompanied 
by 
its 
justification 
in 
the 
necessity 
for 
a
centralization 
of 
power, 
resistance 
to 
Europe, 
and 
so 
on. 
Men 
went
from 
the 
west 
to 
the 
east 
killing 
their 
fellow 
men, 
and 
the 
event
was 
accompanied 
by 
phrases 
about 
the 
glory 
of 
France, 
the 
baseness 
of
England, 
and 
so 
on. 
History 
shows 
us 
that 
these 
justifications 
of 
the
events 
have 
no 
common 
sense 
and 
are 
all 
contradictory, 
as 
in 
the 
case 
of
killing 
a 
man 
as 
the 
result 
of 
recognizing 
his 
rights, 
and 
the 
killing
of 
millions 
in 
Russia 
for 
the 
humiliation 
of 
England. 
But 
these
justifications 
have 
a 
very 
necessary 
significance 
in 
their 
own 
day.

justifications
