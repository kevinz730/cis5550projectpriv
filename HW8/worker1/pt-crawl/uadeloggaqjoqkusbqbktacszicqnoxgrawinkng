quartermaster.

A 
few 
days 
before</h1>his 
departure 
a 
special 
thanksgiving, 
at 
which
Nicholas 
was 
present, 
was 
held 
in 
the 
cathedral 
for 
the 
Russian 
victory.
He 
stood 
a 
little 
behind 
the 
governor 
and 
held 
himself 
with 
military
decorum 
through 
the 
service, 
meditating 
on 
a 
great 
variety 
of 
subjects.
When 
the 
service 
was 
over 
the 
governor's 
wife 
beckoned 
him 
to 
her.

"Have 
you 
seen 
the 
princess?" 
she 
asked, 
indicating 
with 
a 
movement 
of
her 
head 
a 
lady 
standing 
on 
the 
opposite 
side, 
beyond 
the 
choir.

Nicholas 
immediately 
recognized 
Princess 
Mary 
not 
so 
much 
by 
the 
profile
he 
saw 
under 
her 
bonnet 
as<p>
by 
the 
feeling 
of 
solicitude, 
timidity, 
and
pity 
that 
immediately 
overcame 
him. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EP6vf2J1gcnoA.html">Princess</a> 
Mary, 
evidently 
engrossed
by 
her 
thoughts, 
was 
crossing 
herself 
for 
the 
last 
time 
before 
leaving
the 
church.

Nicholas 
looked 
at 
her 
face 
with 
surprise. 
It 
was 
the 
same 
face 
he 
had
seen 
before, 
there 
was 
the 
same 
general 
expression 
of 
refined, 
inner,
spiritual 
labor, 
but 
now 
it 
was 
quite 
differently 
lit 
up. 
There 
was 
a
pathetic 
expression 
of 
sorrow, 
prayer, 
and 
hope 
in 
it. 
As<p>
had 
occurred
before 
when 
she 
was 
present, 
Nicholas 
went 
up 
to 
her 
without 
waiting 
to
be 
prompted 
by 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oG7Xiis3zmeD3.html">the</a> 
governor's 
wife 
and 
not 
asking 
himself 
whether 
or 
not
it 
was 
right 
and 
proper 
to 
address 
her 
here 
in 
church, 
and 
told 
her 
he
had 
heard 
of 
her 
trouble 
and 
sympathized 
with 
his 
whole 
soul. 
As 
soon 
as
she 
heard 
his 
voice 
a 
vivid 
glow 
kindled 
in 
her 
face, 
lighting 
up 
both
her 
sorrow 
and 
her 
joy.

"There 
is 
one 
thing 
I 
wanted 
to 
tell 
you, 
Princess," 
said 
Rostov. 
"It
is 
that 
if 
your 
brother, 
Prince 
Andrew 
Nikolaevich, 
were 
not 
living, 
it
would 
have 
been 
at 
once 
announced 
in 
the 
Gazette, 
as 
he 
is<p>
a 
colonel."

The 
princess 
looked 
at 
him, 
not 
grasping 
what 
he 
was 
saying, 
but 
cheered
by 
the 
expression 
of 
regretful 
sympathy 
on 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ak2v5mbEd1ahj.html">his</a> 
face.

"And 
I 
have 
known 
so 
many 
cases 
of 
a 
splinter 
wound" 
(the 
Gazette 
said
it 
was 
a 
shell) 
"either 
proving 
fatal 
at 
once 
or 
being 
very 
slight,"
continued 
Nicholas. 
"We 
must 
hope 
for 
the 
best, 
and 
I 
am 
sure..."

Princess 
Mary 
interrupted 
him.

"Oh, 
that 
would 
be 
so 
dread..." 
she 
began 
and, 
prevented 
by 
agitation
from 
finishing, 
she 
bent 
her 
head 
with 
a 
movement 
as 
graceful 
as
everything 
she 
did 
in 
his 
presence<p>
and, 
looking 
up 
at 
him 
gratefully,
went 
out, 
following 
her 
aunt.

That 
evening 
Nicholas 
did 
not 
go 
out, 
but 
stayed 
at 
home 
to 
settle 
some
accounts 
with 
the 
horse 
dealers. 
When 
he 
had 
finished 
that<p>
business 
it
was 
already 
too 
late 
to 
go<p>
anywhere 
but 
still 
too 
early 
to 
go 
to 
bed,
and 
for 
a 
long 
time 
he 
paced 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room, 
reflecting 
on 
his
life, 
a 
thing 
he 
rarely 
did.

Princess 
Mary 
had 
made 
an 
agreeable 
impression 
on 
him 
when 
he 
had 
met
her 
in 
Smolensk 
province. 
His 
having 
encountered 
her 
in 
such 
exceptional
circumstances, 
and 
his 
mother 
having 
at 
one 
time 
mentioned 
her 
to 
him 
as
a 
good 
match, 
had 
drawn 
his 
particular 
attention 
to 
her. 
When 
he 
met 
her
again 
in 
Voronezh 
the 
impression 
she 
made 
on 
him 
was 
not 
merely 
pleasing
but 
powerful. 
Nicholas 
had 
been 
struck 
by 
the 
peculiar 
moral 
beauty 
he
observed 
in 
her 
at 
this 
time. 
He 
was, 
however, 
preparing 
to 
go 
away 
and
it 
had 
not 
entered 
his 
head 
to 
regret 
that 
he 
was<p>
thus 
depriving 
himself
of 
chances<p>
of 
meeting 
her. 
But 
that 
day's 
encounter 
in 
church 
had, 
he
felt, 
sunk 
deeper 
than 
was
