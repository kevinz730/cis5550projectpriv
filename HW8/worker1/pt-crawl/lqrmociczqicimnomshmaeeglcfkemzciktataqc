acquaintances,
now 
turned 
on 
Moscow,</h1>the 
army, 
and 
Napoleon.

The 
society 
gathered 
together 
at 
the 
governor's 
was 
the 
best 
in
Voronezh.

There 
were 
a 
great 
many 
ladies 
and 
some 
of 
Nicholas'<p>
Moscow
acquaintances, 
but 
there 
were 
no 
men 
who 
could 
at 
all 
vie 
with 
the
cavalier 
of 
St. 
George, 
the 
hussar 
remount 
officer, 
the 
good-natured
and 
well-bred 
Count 
Rostov. 
Among 
the 
men 
was 
an 
Italian 
prisoner, 
an
officer 
of 
the 
French 
army; 
and 
Nicholas 
felt 
that 
the 
presence 
of 
that
prisoner 
enhanced 
his 
own 
importance 
as 
a 
Russian 
hero. 
The 
Italian
was, 
as 
it 
were, 
a 
war 
trophy. 
Nicholas 
felt 
this, 
it 
seemed 
to 
him
that 
everyone 
regarded 
the 
Italian 
in 
the 
same 
light, 
and 
he 
treated 
him
cordially 
though 
with 
dignity 
and 
restraint.

As 
soon 
as 
Nicholas 
entered 
in 
his 
hussar 
uniform, 
diffusing 
around 
him
a 
fragrance 
of 
perfume 
and 
wine, 
and 
had 
uttered 
the 
words 
"better 
late
than 
never" 
and 
heard 
them 
repeated 
several 
times 
by 
others, 
people
clustered 
around 
him; 
all 
eyes 
turned 
on 
him, 
and 
he 
felt 
at 
once
that 
he 
had 
entered 
into 
his 
proper 
position 
in 
the 
province-that 
of
a 
universal 
favorite: 
a<p>
very 
pleasant 
position, 
and 
intoxicatingly 
so
after 
his 
long 
privations. 
At 
posting 
stations, 
at 
inns, 
and<p>
in 
the
landowner's 
snuggery, 
maidservants 
had 
been 
flattered 
by 
his 
notice, 
and
here 
too 
at 
the 
governor's 
party 
there 
were 
(as 
it 
seemed 
to 
Nicholas)
an 
inexhaustible 
number 
of 
pretty 
young 
women, 
married 
and 
unmarried,
impatiently 
awaiting 
his 
notice. 
The 
women 
and 
girls 
flirted 
with 
him
and, 
from 
the 
first 
day, 
the 
people 
concerned 
themselves 
to 
get 
this
fine 
young 
daredevil 
of 
an 
hussar 
married 
and 
settled 
down. 
Among 
these
was 
the 
governor's 
wife 
herself, 
who<p>
welcomed 
Rostov 
as 
a 
near 
relative
and 
called 
him 
"Nicholas."

Catherine 
Petrovna 
did 
actually 
play 
valses 
and 
the 
ecossaise, 
and
dancing 
began 
in 
which 
Nicholas 
still 
further 
captivated 
the 
provincial
society 
by 
his 
agility. 
His 
particularly 
free 
manner<p>
of 
dancing 
even
surprised 
them 
all. 
Nicholas 
was 
himself 
rather 
surprised 
at 
the 
way 
he
danced 
that 
evening. 
He 
had 
never 
danced 
like 
that 
in 
Moscow 
and 
would
even 
have 
considered 
such 
a 
very 
free 
and 
easy 
manner 
improper 
and 
in
bad 
form, 
but 
here 
he 
felt 
it 
incumbent 
on 
him 
to 
astonish 
them 
all 
by
something 
unusual, 
something 
they 
would 
have 
to 
accept 
as 
the 
regular
thing 
in 
the 
capital 
though 
new 
to 
them 
in 
the 
provinces.

All 
the 
evening 
Nicholas 
paid 
attention 
to 
a 
blue-eyed, 
plump 
and
pleasing 
little 
blonde, 
the 
wife<p>
of 
one<p>
of 
the 
provincial 
officials.
With 
the 
naive 
conviction 
of 
young 
men 
in 
a 
merry 
mood 
that 
other 
men's
wives 
were 
created 
for 
them,<p>
Rostov 
did 
not 
leave 
the 
lady's 
side 
and
treated 
her 
husband 
in 
a 
friendly 
and 
conspiratorial 
style, 
as 
if,
without 
speaking 
of 
it, 
they<p>
knew<p>
how 
capitally 
Nicholas 
and 
the 
lady
would 
get 
on 
together. 
The 
husband, 
however, 
did 
not 
seem 
to 
share 
that
conviction 
and
