iqhasaygroyafirqkiyawasggkgodkhcriekeeam length 4 3322 page 3322 <h1>due 
chiefly 
to</h1>the 
attention 
that 
was
being 
paid 
to 
her, 
read 
the 
last 
words:

"We 
ourselves 
will 
not<p>
delay 
to 
appear 
among 
our 
people 
in 
that 
Capital
and 
in 
other 
parts 
of 
our 
realm 
for 
consultation, 
and 
for 
the 
direction
of 
all 
our 
levies, 
both 
those 
now 
barring 
the 
enemy's 
path 
and 
those
freshly 
formed 
to 
defeat 
him 
wherever 
he 
may 
appear. 
May 
the 
ruin 
he
hopes 
to 
bring 
upon 
us 
recoil 
on 
his 
own 
head, 
and 
may 
Europe 
delivered
from 
bondage 
glorify<p>
the 
name 
of 
Russia!"


"Yes, 
that's 
it!" 
cried 
the 
count, 
opening 
his 
moist 
eyes 
and 
sniffing
repeatedly, 
as 
if 
a 
strong 
vinaigrette 
had 
been 
held 
to 
his 
nose; 
and 
he
added, 
"Let 
the 
Emperor 
but 
say 
the 
word 
and 
we'll 
sacrifice 
everything
and 
begrudge 
nothing."

Before 
Shinshin 
had 
time 
to 
utter 
the 
joke 
he 
was 
ready 
to 
make 
on 
the
count's 
patriotism, 
Natasha 
jumped 
up 
from 
her 
place 
and 
ran 
to 
her
father.

"What 
a 
darling 
our 
Papa 
is!" 
she 
cried, 
kissing 
him, 
and<p>
she 
again
looked 
at 
Pierre 
with 
the 
unconscious 
coquetry 
that 
had 
returned 
to 
her
with 
her 
better 
spirits.

"There! 
Here's 
a 
patriot 
for 
you!" 
said 
Shinshin.

"Not 
a 
patriot 
at 
all, 
but 
simply..." 
Natasha 
replied 
in 
an 
injured
tone. 
"Everything 
seems 
funny 
to 
you, 
but 
this 
isn't 
at 
all 
a 
joke...."

"A 
joke 
indeed!" 
put 
in 
the 
count. 
"Let 
him 
but 
say 
the 
word 
and 
we'll
all 
go.... 
We're 
not 
Germans!"

"But 
did 
you 
notice, 
it 
says, 
'for 
consultation'?" 
said 
Pierre.

"Never 
mind 
what 
it's 
for...."

At 
this 
moment, 
Petya, 
to 
whom 
nobody 
was 
paying 
any 
attention, 
came 
up
to 
his 
father 
with 
a 
very 
flushed 
face 
and 
said 
in 
his 
breaking 
voice
that 
was 
now 
deep 
and 
now 
shrill:

"Well, 
Papa, 
I 
tell 
you 
definitely, 
and 
Mamma 
too, 
it's 
as 
you 
please,
but 
I 
say 
definitely 
that 
you 
must 
let 
me 
enter 
the 
army, 
because 
I
can't... 
that's 
all...."

The 
countess, 
in 
dismay, 
looked 
up 
to 
heaven, 
clasped 
her 
hands, 
and
turned 
angrily 
to 
her 
husband.

"That 
comes 
of 
your 
talking!" 
said 
she.

But 
the 
count 
had 
already 
recovered 
from 
his<p>
excitement.

"Come, 
come!" 
said 
he. 
"Here's 
a 
fine 
warrior! 
No! 
Nonsense! 
You 
must
study."

"It's 
not 
nonsense, 
Papa. 
Fedya 
Obolenski 
is 
younger 
than 
I, 
and 
he's
going 
too. 
Besides, 
all 
the 
same 
I 
can't 
study 
now 
when..." 
Petya
stopped 
short, 
flushed 
till 
he 
perspired, 
but 
still 
got 
out 
the 
words,
"when 
our 
Fatherland 
is 
in 
danger."

"That'll 
do, 
that'll 
do-nonsense...."

"But 
you 
said 
yourself 
that 
we 
would 
sacrifice 
everything."

"Petya! 
Be 
quiet, 
I 
tell 
you!" 
cried 
the 
count, 
with 
a 
glance 
at 
his
wife, 
who 
had 
turned 
pale 
and 
was 
staring 
fixedly 
at 
her 
son.

"And 
I 
tell 
you-Peter 
Kirilych 
here 
will 
also 
tell 
you..."

"Nonsense, 
I 
tell 
you. 
Your 
mother's 
milk 
has 
hardly 
dried 
on 
your 
lips
and 
you 
want 
to 
go 
into 
the 
army! 
There, 
there, 
I 
tell 
you," 
and 
the
count<p>
moved 
to 
go 
out 
of 
the 
room, 
taking 
the 
papers, 
probably 
to
