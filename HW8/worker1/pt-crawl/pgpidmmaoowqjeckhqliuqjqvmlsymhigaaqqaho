her 
burden</h1>oppressed 
her 
now 
more 
than
ever 
because 
Anatole's 
presence 
had 
vividly 
recalled 
to 
her 
the 
time
when 
she 
was 
not 
like 
that 
and 
when 
everything 
was 
light 
and 
gay. 
She
sat 
in 
an 
armchair 
in 
<a href="/aVzUge/td26W1kQqNG.html">her</a> 
dressing 
jacket 
and 
nightcap 
and 
Katie, 
sleepy
and 
disheveled, 
beat 
and 
turned 
the 
heavy 
feather 
bed 
for 
the 
third
time, 
muttering 
to 
herself.

"I 
told 
you 
it 
was 
all 
lumps 
and 
holes!" 
the 
little 
princess
repeated. 
"I 
should 
be 
glad 
enough 
to 
fall 
asleep, 
so 
it's 
not 
my
fault!" 
and 
her 
voice 
quivered 
like 
that 
of 
a 
child 
about 
to 
cry.

The 
old 
prince 
did 
not 
sleep 
either. 
Tikhon, 
half 
asleep, 
heard 
him
pacing 
angrily 
about 
and 
snorting. 
The 
old 
prince 
felt 
as 
though 
he
had 
been 
insulted 
through 
his 
daughter. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EP6vf2J1gcnoA.html">The</a> 
insult 
was 
the 
more 
pointed
because 
it 
concerned 
not 
himself 
but 
another, 
his 
daughter, 
whom 
he
loved 
more 
than 
himself. 
He 
kept 
telling 
himself 
that 
he 
would 
consider
the 
whole 
matter 
and 
decide 
what 
was 
right 
and 
how 
he 
should 
act, 
but
instead 
of 
that<p>
he 
only 
excited 
himself 
more 
and 
more.

"The 
first 
man 
that 
turns 
up-she 
forgets 
her 
father 
and 
everything
else, 
runs 
upstairs 
and 
does 
up 
her 
hair 
and 
wags 
her 
tail 
and 
is 
unlike
herself! 
Glad 
to 
throw 
her 
father 
over! 
And 
she 
knew 
I 
should 
notice
it. 
Fr... 
fr... 
fr! 
And 
don't 
I 
see 
that 
that 
idiot 
had 
eyes 
only 
for
Bourienne-I 
shall 
have 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
her. 
And 
how 
is 
it 
she 
has 
not
pride 
enough 
to 
see 
it? 
If 
she 
has 
no 
pride 
for 
herself 
<a href="/cZl/tK7pufMC.html">she</a> 
might 
at
least 
have 
some 
for 
my 
sake! 
She 
must 
be 
shown 
that 
the 
blockhead 
thinks
nothing 
of 
her 
and 
looks 
only 
at 
Bourienne. 
No, 
she 
has 
no 
pride... 
<a href="/aVzUge/bfW6Gj0w8.html">but
I'll</a> 
let 
her 
see...."

The 
old 
prince 
knew 
that 
if 
he 
told 
his 
daughter 
she 
was 
making 
a
mistake 
and 
that 
Anatole 
meant 
to 
flirt 
with 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne,
Princess 
Mary's 
self-esteem 
would 
be 
wounded 
and 
his 
point 
(not 
to
be 
parted 
from 
her) 
would 
be 
gained, 
so 
pacifying 
himself 
with 
this
thought, 
he 
called 
Tikhon 
and 
began 
to 
undress.

"What 
devil 
brought 
them 
here?" 
thought 
he, 
while 
Tikhon 
was
putting 
the 
nightshirt 
over 
his 
dried-up 
old 
body 
and 
gray-haired 
chest.
