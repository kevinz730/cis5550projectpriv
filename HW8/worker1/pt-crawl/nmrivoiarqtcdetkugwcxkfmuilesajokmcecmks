"Ah,</h1>Nikita 
Ivanych!" 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/TAy2cPwD6i.html">cried</a> 
Nicholas, 
rising 
politely, 
and 
as 
if 
<a href="/aVzUge/bmp3Url9qrwB.html">wishing
Nikita</a> 
Ivanych 
to 
share 
his 
joke, 
he 
began 
to 
tell 
him 
of 
his 
intention
to 
elope 
with 
a 
blonde 
lady.

The 
husband 
smiled 
gloomily, 
the 
wife 
gaily. 
The 
governor's 
good-natured
wife 
came 
up 
with 
a 
look 
of 
disapproval.

"Anna 
Ignatyevna 
wants 
to 
see 
you, 
Nicholas," 
said 
she, 
pronouncing 
the
name 
so 
that 
Nicholas 
at 
once 
understood 
that 
Anna 
Ignatyevna 
was 
a 
very
important 
person. 
"Come, 
Nicholas! 
You 
know 
you 
let 
me 
call 
you 
so?"

"Oh, 
yes, 
Aunt. 
Who 
is 
she?"

"Anna 
Ignatyevna 
Malvintseva. 
She 
has 
heard 
from 
her 
niece 
how 
you
rescued 
her.... 
Can 
you 
guess?"

"I 
rescued 
such 
a 
lot 
of 
them!" 
said 
Nicholas.

"Her 
niece, 
Princess 
Bolkonskaya. 
<a href="/aVzUge/Eq19BwgT0.html">She</a> 
is 
here 
in 
Voronezh 
with 
her 
aunt.
Oho! 
How 
you 
blush. 
Why, 
are...?"

"Not 
a 
bit! 
Please 
don't, 
Aunt!"

"Very 
well, 
very 
well!... 
Oh, 
what 
a 
fellow 
you 
are!"

The 
governor's 
wife 
led 
him 
up 
to 
a 
tall 
and 
very 
stout 
old 
lady 
with
a 
blue 
headdress, 
who 
had 
just 
finished 
her 
game 
of 
cards 
with 
the 
most
important 
personages 
of 
the 
town. 
This 
was 
Malvintseva, 
Princess 
Mary's
aunt 
on 
her 
mother's 
side, 
a 
rich, 
childless 
widow 
who 
always 
lived 
in
Voronezh. 
When 
Rostov 
approached 
her 
she 
was 
standing 
settling 
up 
for
the 
game. 
She 
looked 
at 
him 
and, 
screwing 
up 
her 
eyes 
sternly, 
continued
to 
upbraid 
the 
general 
who 
had 
won 
from 
her.

"Very 
pleased, 
mon 
cher," 
she 
then 
said, 
holding 
out 
her<p>
hand 
to
Nicholas. 
"Pray 
come 
and 
see 
me."

After 
a 
few 
words 
about 
Princess 
Mary 
and 
her 
late 
father, 
whom
Malvintseva 
had 
evidently 
not 
liked, 
and 
having 
asked 
what 
Nicholas
knew 
of 
Prince 
Andrew, 
who 
also 
was 
evidently 
no 
favorite 
of 
hers, 
the
important 
old 
lady 
dismissed 
Nicholas 
after 
repeating 
her 
invitation 
to
come 
to 
see 
her.

Nicholas 
promised 
to 
come 
and 
blushed 
again 
as 
he 
bowed. 
At 
the 
mention
of 
Princess 
Mary 
he 
experienced 
a 
feeling 
of 
shyness 
and 
even 
<a href="/aVzUge/WD9fOHvf2Wu9.html">of</a> 
fear,
which 
he 
himself 
did 
not 
understand.

When 
he 
had 
parted 
from 
Malvintseva 
Nicholas 
wished 
to 
return 
to 
the
dancing, 
but 
the 
governor's 
little 
wife 
placed 
her 
plump 
hand 
on 
his
sleeve 
and, 
saying 
that 
she 
wanted 
to 
have 
a 
talk 
with 
him, 
led 
him 
to
her 
sitting 
room, 
from 
which 
those 
who 
were 
there 
immediately 
withdrew
so 
as 
not 
to 
be 
in 
her 
way.

"Do 
you 
know, 
dear 
boy," 
began 
the 
governor's<p>
wife 
with 
a 
serious
expression 
on 
her 
kind 
little 
face, 
"that 
really 
would 
be 
the 
match 
for
you: 
would 
you 
like 
me 
to 
arrange 
it?"

"Whom 
do 
you 
mean,<p>
