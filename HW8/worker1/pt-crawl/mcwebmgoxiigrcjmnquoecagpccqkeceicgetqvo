wanted 
to 
pass
over 
the 
horrible 
details, 
but 
Natasha 
insisted 
that 
he 
should 
not 
omit
anything.

Pierre 
began 
to 
tell 
about 
Karataev, 
but 
paused. 
By 
this 
time 
he 
had
risen 
from 
the 
table 
and 
was 
pacing 
the 
room, 
Natasha 
following 
him 
with
her 
eyes. 
Then 
he 
added:

"No, 
you 
can't 
understand 
what 
I 
learned 
from 
that 
illiterate 
man-that
simple 
fellow."

"Yes, 
yes, 
go 
on!" 
said 
Natasha. 
"Where 
is 
he?"

"They 
killed 
him 
almost 
before 
my 
eyes."

And 
Pierre, 
his 
voice 
trembling 
continually, 
went 
on 
to 
tell 
of 
the 
last
days 
of 
their 
retreat, 
of 
Karataev's 
illness 
and 
his 
death.

He 
told 
of 
his 
adventures 
as 
he 
had 
never 
yet 
recalled 
them. 
He 
now, 
as
it 
were, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Xs7HAb8Wu7IQlv.html">saw</a> 
a 
new 
meaning 
in 
all 
he 
had 
gone 
through. 
Now 
that 
he 
was
telling 
it 
all 
to<p>
Natasha 
he 
experienced 
that 
pleasure 
which 
a 
man 
has
when 
women 
listen 
to 
him-not 
clever 
women 
who 
when 
listening 
either 
try
to 
remember 
what 
they 
hear 
to 
enrich 
their<p>
minds 
and 
when 
opportunity
offers 
to 
retell 
it, 
or 
who 
wish 
to 
adopt 
it 
to 
some 
thought 
of 
their
own 
and 
promptly 
contribute 
their 
own 
clever 
comments 
prepared 
in 
their
little 
mental 
workshop-but 
the 
pleasure 
given 
by 
real 
women 
gifted 
with
a 
capacity 
to 
select 
and 
absorb 
the 
very 
best 
a 
man 
shows 
of 
himself.
Natasha 
without 
knowing 
it 
was 
all 
attention: 
she 
did 
not 
lose 
a 
word,
no 
single 
quiver 
in 
Pierre's 
voice, 
no 
look, 
no 
twitch 
of 
a 
muscle 
in
his 
face, 
nor 
a 
single 
gesture. 
She 
caught 
the 
unfinished 
word 
in 
its
flight 
and 
took 
it 
straight 
into 
her 
open 
heart, 
divining 
the 
secret
meaning 
of 
all 
Pierre's 
mental 
travail.

Princess 
Mary 
understood 
his 
story 
and 
sympathized 
with 
him, 
but 
she
now 
saw 
something 
else 
that 
absorbed 
all 
her 
attention. 
She 
saw 
the
possibility 
of 
love 
and 
happiness 
between 
Natasha 
and 
Pierre, 
and 
the
first 
thought 
of 
this 
filled 
<a href="/aVzUge/NhF8l41x.html">her</a> 
heart 
with 
gladness.

It 
was 
three 
o'clock 
in 
the 
morning. 
The 
footmen 
came 
in 
with 
sad 
and
stern 
faces 
to 
change 
the 
candles, 
but 
no 
one 
noticed 
them.

Pierre 
finished 
his 
story. 
Natasha 
continued 
to 
look 
at 
him 
intently
with 
bright, 
attentive, 
and 
animated 
eyes, 
as 
if 
trying 
to 
understand
something 
more 
which 
he 
had 
perhaps 
left 
untold. 
Pierre 
in<p>
shamefaced
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Li3a6l4X.html">happy</a> 
confusion 
<a href="/cZl/kW5XT8UHdX0aJoR.html">glanced</a> 
occasionally 
at 
her, 
and 
tried 
to 
think 
what
to 
say 
next 
to 
introduce 
a 
fresh 
subject. 
Princess 
Mary 
was 
silent.
