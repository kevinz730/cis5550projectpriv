the 
gray
haze. 
It 
grew 
light.</h1>The 
evening 
was 
ending, 
but 
the 
night 
had 
not 
yet
come. 
Pierre 
got 
up 
and 
left 
his 
new 
companions, 
crossing 
between 
the
campfires 
to 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
road 
where 
he 
had 
been 
told 
the
common 
soldier 
prisoners 
were 
stationed. 
He 
wanted 
to 
talk 
to 
them. 
On
the 
road 
he 
was 
stopped 
by 
a 
French 
sentinel 
who 
ordered 
him 
back.

Pierre 
turned 
back, 
not 
to 
his 
companions 
by 
the 
campfire, 
but 
to 
an
unharnessed 
cart 
where 
there 
was 
nobody. 
Tucking 
his 
legs 
under 
him 
and
dropping 
his 
head 
he 
sat 
down 
on 
the 
cold 
ground 
by 
the 
wheel 
of 
the
cart 
and 
remained 
motionless 
a 
long<p>
while 
sunk 
in 
thought. 
Suddenly 
he
burst 
out 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Uf7tvrb2gK1hOZs.html">into</a> 
a 
fit 
of 
his 
broad, 
good-natured 
laughter, 
so 
loud 
that
men 
from 
various 
sides 
turned 
with 
surprise 
to 
see 
what 
this 
strange 
and
evidently 
solitary 
laughter 
could 
mean.

"Ha-ha-ha!" 
laughed 
Pierre. 
And 
he 
said 
aloud 
to 
himself: 
"The 
soldier
did 
not 
let 
me 
pass. 
They 
took 
me 
and 
shut 
me 
up. 
They 
hold 
me 
captive.
What,<p>
me? 
Me? 
My 
immortal 
soul? 
Ha-ha-ha! 
Ha-ha-ha!..." 
and 
he 
laughed
till 
tears 
started 
to 
his 
eyes.

A 
man 
got 
up 
and 
came 
to 
see 
what 
this 
queer 
big 
fellow 
was 
laughing 
at
all 
by 
himself. 
Pierre 
stopped 
laughing, 
got 
up, 
went 
farther 
away 
from
the 
inquisitive 
man, 
and 
looked 
around 
him.

The 
huge, 
endless 
bivouac 
that 
had 
previously 
resounded 
with 
the
crackling 
of 
campfires 
and 
the 
voices 
of 
many 
men 
had 
grown 
quiet, 
the
red 
campfires 
were 
growing 
paler 
and 
dying 
down. 
High 
up 
in 
the 
light
sky 
hung 
the 
full 
moon. 
Forests 
and 
fields 
beyond 
the 
camp, 
unseen
before, 
were 
now 
visible 
in 
the 
distance. 
And 
farther 
still, 
beyond
those 
forests<p>
and 
fields, 
the 
bright, 
oscillating, 
limitless 
distance
lured 
one 
to 
itself. 
Pierre 
glanced 
up 
at 
the 
sky 
and 
the 
twinkling
stars 
in 
its 
faraway 
depths. 
"And 
all 
that 
is 
me, 
all 
that 
is 
within 
me,
and 
it 
is 
all 
I!" 
thought 
Pierre. 
"And 
they 
caught 
all 
that 
and 
put 
it
into 
a<p>
shed 
boarded 
up 
with 
planks!" 
He 
smiled, 
and 
went 
and 
lay 
down 
to
sleep 
beside 
his 
companions.





CHAPTER 
XV

In 
the 
early 
days 
of 
October 
another 
envoy 
came 
to<p>
Kutuzov 
with 
a 
letter
from 
Napoleon 
proposing 
peace 
and 
falsely 
dated 
from 
Moscow, 
though
Napoleon 
was 
already 
not 
far 
from 
Kutuzov 
on 
the 
old 
Kaluga 
road.
Kutuzov 
replied 
to 
this 
letter 
as 
he 
had 
done 
to 
the 
one 
formerly
brought 
by 
Lauriston, 
saying 
that 
there 
could 
be 
no 
question 
of 
peace.

Soon 
after 
that 
a 
report 
was 
received 
from 
Dorokhov's 
guerrilla
detachment 
operating 
to 
the 
left 
of 
Tarutino 
that 
troops 
of 
Broussier's
division 
had 
been 
seen 
at 
Forminsk 
and 
that 
being 
separated 
from 
the
rest 
of 
the 
French 
army 
they 
might 
easily 
be 
destroyed. 
The 
soldiers 
and
officers 
again 
demanded 
action. 
Generals 
on 
the 
staff, 
excited 
by 
the
memory 
of 
the 
easy 
victory 
at 
Tarutino, 
urged 
Kutuzov 
to 
carry 
out
Dorokhov's 
suggestion. 
Kutuzov 
did 
not 
consider 
any 
offensive 
necessary.
The 
result 
was 
a 
compromise 
which 
was
