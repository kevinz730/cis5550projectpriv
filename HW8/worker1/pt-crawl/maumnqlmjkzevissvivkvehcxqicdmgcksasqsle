ushered 
Prince 
Andrew 
before</h1>him 
along 
a
corridor 
to 
the 
cabinet 
where 
the 
Minister 
of 
War 
was 
at 
work. 
The
adjutant 
by 
his 
elaborate 
courtesy 
appeared 
to 
wish 
to 
ward 
off 
any
attempt 
at 
familiarity 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Russian 
messenger.

Prince 
Andrew's 
joyous 
feeling 
was 
considerably 
weakened 
as 
he
approached 
the 
door 
of 
the 
minister's 
room. 
He 
felt 
offended, 
and
without 
his 
noticing 
it 
the 
feeling 
of 
offense 
immediately 
turned 
into
one 
of 
disdain 
which 
was 
quite 
uncalled 
for. 
His 
fertile 
mind 
instantly
suggested 
to 
him 
a 
point 
of 
view 
which 
gave 
him 
a 
right 
to 
despise
the 
adjutant 
and 
the 
minister. 
"Away 
from 
the 
smell 
of 
powder, 
they
probably 
think 
it 
easy 
to 
gain 
victories!" 
he 
thought.<p>
His<p>
eyes
narrowed 
disdainfully, 
he 
entered 
the 
room 
of 
the 
Minister 
of 
War 
with
peculiarly 
deliberate 
steps. 
This 
feeling 
of 
disdain 
was 
heightened
when 
he 
saw 
the 
minister 
seated 
at 
a 
large 
table 
reading 
some 
papers
and 
making 
pencil 
notes<p>
on 
them, 
and 
for 
the 
first 
two 
or 
three 
minutes
taking 
no 
notice 
of 
his 
arrival. 
A 
wax 
candle 
stood 
at 
each<p>
side 
of 
the
minister's 
bent 
bald 
head 
with 
its 
gray 
temples. 
He 
went 
on 
reading
to 
the 
end, 
without 
raising 
his 
eyes 
at 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
door 
and 
the
sound 
of 
footsteps.

"Take 
this 
and 
deliver 
it," 
said 
he 
to 
his 
adjutant, 
handing 
him 
the
papers 
and 
still 
taking 
no 
notice 
of 
the 
special 
messenger.

Prince 
Andrew 
felt 
that 
either 
the 
actions 
of 
Kutuzov's 
army
interested 
the 
Minister 
of 
War 
less 
than 
any 
of 
the 
other 
matters 
he 
was
concerned 
with, 
or 
he 
wanted 
to 
give 
the 
Russian 
special 
messenger 
that
impression. 
"But 
that 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
perfect 
indifference 
to 
me," 
he
thought. 
The 
minister 
drew 
the<p>
remaining 
papers 
together, 
arranged 
them
evenly, 
and 
then 
raised 
his 
head. 
He 
had 
an 
intellectual 
and 
distinctive
head, 
but 
the 
instant 
he 
turned 
to 
Prince 
Andrew 
the 
firm, 
intelligent
expression 
on 
his 
face 
changed 
in 
a 
way 
evidently 
deliberate 
and
habitual 
to 
him. 
His 
face 
took 
on 
the 
stupid 
artificial 
smile 
(which
does 
not 
even 
attempt 
to 
<a href="/cZl/qj9eXK5ZNkA6pXQvm.html">hide</a> 
its 
artificiality) 
of 
a 
man 
who 
is
continually 
receiving 
many 
petitioners 
one 
after 
another.

"From 
General 
Field 
Marshal 
Kutuzov?" 
he 
asked. 
"I 
hope 
it 
is
good 
news? 
There 
has 
been 
an 
encounter 
with 
Mortier? 
A 
victory? 
It 
was
high 
time!"

He 
took 
the 
dispatch 
which 
was 
addressed 
to 
him 
and 
began 
to 
read 
it
with 
a 
mournful 
expression.

"Oh, 
my 
God! 
My 
God! 
Schmidt!" 
he 
exclaimed 
in 
German. 
"What 
a
calamity!
