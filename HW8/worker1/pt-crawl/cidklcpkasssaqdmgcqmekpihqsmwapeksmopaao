CHAPTER 
XIII

On 
the 
seventeenth 
of 
August 
Rostov 
and 
Ilyin, 
accompanied 
by 
Lavrushka
who 
had 
just 
returned 
from 
captivity 
and 
by 
an 
hussar 
orderly, 
left
their 
quarters 
at 
Yankovo, 
ten 
miles 
from 
Bogucharovo, 
and 
went 
for 
a
ride-to 
try 
a 
new 
horse 
Ilyin 
had 
bought 
and 
to 
find 
out 
whether 
there
was 
any 
hay 
to 
be 
had 
in 
the 
villages.

For 
the 
last 
three 
days 
Bogucharovo 
had 
lain 
between 
the 
two 
hostile
armies, 
so 
that 
it 
was 
as 
easy 
for 
the 
Russian 
rearguard 
to 
get 
to 
it 
as
for 
the 
French 
vanguard; 
Rostov, 
as 
a 
careful 
squadron 
commander, 
wished
to 
take 
such 
provisions 
as 
remained 
at 
Bogucharovo 
before 
the 
French
could 
get 
them.

Rostov 
and 
Ilyin 
were 
in 
the 
merriest 
of 
moods. 
On 
the 
way 
to
Bogucharovo, 
a 
princely 
estate 
with 
a 
dwelling 
house 
and 
farm 
where
they<p>
hoped 
to 
find 
many 
domestic 
serfs 
and 
pretty 
girls, 
they 
questioned
Lavrushka 
about 
Napoleon 
and 
laughed 
at 
his 
stories, 
and 
raced 
one
another 
to 
try 
Ilyin's 
horse.

Rostov 
had 
no 
idea 
that 
the 
village 
he 
was 
entering 
was 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cp7Ufz6ClqSz.html">property</a> 
of
that 
very 
Bolkonski 
who 
had 
been 
engaged 
to 
his 
sister.

Rostov 
and 
Ilyin 
gave 
rein 
to 
their 
horses 
for 
a 
last 
race 
along 
the
incline 
before 
reaching 
Bogucharovo, 
and 
Rostov, 
outstripping 
Ilyin, 
was
the 
first 
to 
gallop 
<a href="/aVzUge/Jk1i6leWib5hsJDK.html">into</a> 
the 
village 
street.

"You're 
first!"<p>
cried 
Ilyin, 
flushed.

"Yes, 
always 
first 
both 
on 
the 
grassland 
and 
here," 
answered 
Rostov,
stroking 
his 
heated 
Donets 
horse.

"And 
I'd 
have 
won 
on 
my 
Frenchy, 
your 
excellency," 
said 
Lavrushka
from 
behind, 
alluding 
to 
his 
shabby 
cart 
horse, 
"only 
I 
didn't 
wish 
to
mortify 
you."

They 
rode 
at 
a 
footpace 
to 
the 
barn, 
where 
a 
large 
crowd 
of 
<a href="/cZl/DU5e23A.html">peasants</a> 
was
standing.

Some 
of 
the 
men 
bared 
their 
heads, 
others 
stared 
at 
the 
new<p>
arrivals
without 
doffing 
their 
caps. 
Two 
tall 
old 
peasants 
with 
wrinkled 
faces
and 
scanty 
beards 
emerged 
from 
the 
tavern, 
smiling, 
staggering, 
and
singing 
some 
incoherent 
song, 
and 
approached 
the 
officers.

"Fine 
fellows!" 
said 
Rostov 
laughing. 
"Is 
there 
any 
hay 
here?"

"And 
how 
like 
one 
another," 
said 
Ilyin.

"A 
mo-o-st 
me-r-r-y 
co-o-m-pa...!" 
sang 
one 
of 
the 
peasants 
with 
a
blissful 
smile.

One 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rz63KSVyY0ws.html">the</a> 
men 
came 
out 
of 
the 
crowd 
and 
went
