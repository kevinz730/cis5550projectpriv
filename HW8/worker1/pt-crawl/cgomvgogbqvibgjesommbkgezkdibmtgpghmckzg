cgomvgogbqvibgjesommbkgezkdibmtgpghmckzg length 4 4531 page 4531 <h1>almost 
imperceptibly</h1>while 
listening 
to 
his 
mother. 
He
laughed 
blandly 
at 
her 
naive 
diplomacy 
but 
listened 
to 
what 
she 
had
to 
say, 
and 
sometimes 
questioned 
her 
carefully 
about 
the 
Penza 
and
Nizhegorod 
estates.

Julie 
had 
long 
been 
expecting 
<a href="/cZl/qj9eXK5ZNkA6pXQvm.html">a</a> 
proposal 
from 
her 
melancholy 
adorer 
and
was 
ready 
to 
accept 
it; 
but 
some 
secret 
feeling 
of 
repulsion 
for 
her,
for 
her 
passionate 
desire 
to 
get 
married, 
<a href="/cZl/Pw2SDFV7U1wKMFq.html">for</a><p>
her 
artificiality, 
and
a 
feeling 
of 
horror 
at 
renouncing 
the 
possibility 
of 
real 
love 
still
restrained 
Boris. 
His 
leave 
was 
expiring. 
He 
spent 
every 
day 
and 
whole
days 
at 
the 
Karagins', 
and 
every 
day 
on 
thinking 
the 
matter 
over
told 
himself 
that 
he 
would 
propose 
tomorrow. 
But 
in 
Julie's 
presence,
looking 
at 
her 
red 
face 
and 
chin 
(nearly 
always 
powdered), 
her 
moist
eyes, 
and 
her 
expression 
of 
continual 
readiness 
to 
pass 
at 
once 
from
melancholy 
to 
an 
unnatural 
rapture 
of 
married 
bliss, 
Boris 
could 
not
utter 
the 
decisive 
words, 
though 
in 
imagination 
he 
had 
long 
regarded
himself 
as 
the 
possessor 
of 
those 
Penza 
and 
Nizhegorod 
estates 
and
had 
apportioned 
the 
use 
of 
the 
income 
from 
them. 
Julie 
saw 
Boris'
indecision, 
and 
sometimes 
the 
thought 
occurred 
to 
her 
that 
she 
was
repulsive 
to 
him, 
but 
her 
feminine 
self-deception 
immediately 
supplied
her 
with 
consolation, 
and 
she 
told 
herself 
that 
he 
was 
only 
shy 
from
love. 
Her 
melancholy, 
however, 
began 
to 
turn 
to 
irritability, 
and 
not
long 
before 
Boris' 
departure 
she 
formed 
a 
definite 
plan 
of 
action.
Just 
as 
Boris' 
leave 
of 
absence 
was 
expiring, 
Anatole 
Kuragin 
made
his 
appearance 
in 
Moscow, 
and 
of 
course 
in 
the 
Karagins' 
drawing
room, 
and 
Julie, 
suddenly 
abandoning 
her 
melancholy, 
became 
cheerful 
and
very 
attentive 
to 
Kuragin.

"My 
dear," 
said 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
to 
her 
son, 
"I 
know 
from 
a
reliable 
source 
that 
Prince 
Vasili 
has 
sent 
his 
son 
to 
Moscow 
to 
get
him 
married 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EJ8iU0FKLE4bmpaY.html">to</a> 
Julie. 
I 
am 
so 
fond 
of 
Julie 
that 
I 
should 
be 
sorry 
for
her. 
What 
do 
you 
think 
of 
it, 
my 
dear?"

The 
idea 
of 
being 
made 
a 
fool 
of 
and 
of 
having 
thrown 
away 
that 
whole
month 
of 
arduous 
melancholy 
service 
to 
Julie, 
and 
of 
seeing 
all
the 
revenue 
from 
the 
Penza 
estates 
which 
he 
had 
already 
mentally
apportioned 
and 
put 
to 
proper 
use 
fall 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
another, 
and
especially 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
that 
idiot 
Anatole, 
pained 
Boris. 
He 
drove
to 
the 
Karagins' 
with 
the 
firm 
intention 
of 
proposing. 
Julie 
met
him 
in 
a 
gay, 
careless 
manner, 
spoke 
casually 
of 
how 
she 
had 
enjoyed
yesterday's 
ball, 
and 
asked 
when 
he 
was 
leaving. 
Though 
Boris 
had
come 
intentionally 
to 
speak 
of 
his 
love 
and 
therefore 
meant 
to 
be
tender, 
he 
began 
speaking 
irritably 
of 
feminine 
inconstancy, 
of 
how
easily 
women 
can 
turn 
from 
sadness 
to 
joy, 
and 
how 
their 
moods 
depend
solely 
on 
who 
happens 
to 
be 
paying 
court 
to 
them. 
Julie 
was 
offended 
and
replied 
that 
it 
was 
true 
that 
a 
woman 
needs 
variety, 
and 
the 
same 
thing
over 
and 
over 
again 
would 
weary 
anyone.

"Then 
I 
should 
advise 
you..." 
Boris 
began, 
wishing 
to 
sting 
her;
but 
<a href="/cZl/Gs8dBoY0tjjJI2.html">at</a> 
that 
instant 
the 
galling 
thought 
occurred 
to 
him 
that 
he 
might
have 
to 
leave 
Moscow 
without 
having 
accomplished 
his 
aim, 
and 
have
vainly 
wasted 
his 
efforts-which 
was 
a 
thing 
he 
never 
allowed 
to
happen.

He 
checked 
himself 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
sentence, 
lowered 
his 
eyes 
to
avoid 
seeing 
her 
unpleasantly 
irritated 
and 
irresolute 
face, 
and 
said:

"I 
did 
not 
come 
here 
at 
all 
to 
quarrel 
with 
you. 
On 
the 
contrary..."

He 
glanced 
at 
her 
to 
make<p>
sure 
that 
he 
might 
go 
on.<p>
Her 
irritability 
had
suddenly 
<a href="/cZl/CS7GLq8IDLzm4oOe.html">quite</a> 
vanished, 
and 
her 
anxious, 
imploring 
eyes 
were 
fixed 
on
him 
with 
greedy 
expectation. 
"I 
can 
always 
arrange 
so 
as 
not 
to 
see
her 
often," 
thought 
Boris. 
"The 
affair 
has 
been 
begun 
and 
must 
be
finished!" 
He 
blushed 
hotly, 
raised 
his 
eyes 
to
