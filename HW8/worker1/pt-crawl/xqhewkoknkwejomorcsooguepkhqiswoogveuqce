of 
the
lights 
and 
shouts 
in 
the 
enemy's 
camp. 
Rostov 
rode 
up 
to 
Bagration,
reported 
to 
him, 
and 
then 
joined 
the 
adjutants 
listening 
to 
what 
the
generals 
were 
saying.

"Believe 
me," 
said 
Prince 
Dolgorukov, 
addressing 
Bagration, 
"it
is 
nothing 
but 
a 
trick! 
He 
has 
retreated 
and 
ordered 
the 
rearguard 
to
kindle 
fires 
and 
make 
a 
noise 
to 
deceive 
us."

"Hardly," 
said 
Bagration. 
"I 
saw 
them 
this 
evening 
on 
that
knoll; 
if 
they 
had 
retreated 
they 
would 
have 
withdrawn 
from 
that 
too....
Officer!" 
said 
Bagration 
to 
Rostov, 
"are 
the 
enemy's 
skirmishers
still 
there?"

"They 
were 
there 
this 
evening, 
but 
now 
I 
don't 
know, 
your
excellency. 
Shall 
I 
go 
with 
some 
of 
my 
hussars 
to 
see?" 
replied
Rostov.

Bagration 
stopped 
and, 
before 
replying, 
tried 
to 
see 
Rostov's 
face
in 
the 
mist.

"Well, 
go 
and 
see," 
he 
said, 
after 
a 
pause.

"Yes, 
sir."

Rostov 
spurred 
his 
horse, 
called 
to 
Sergeant 
Fedchenko 
and 
two 
other
hussars, 
told 
them 
to 
follow 
him, 
and 
trotted 
downhill 
in 
<a href="/nocrawl/aVzUge/sM2lOZ38o.html">the</a> 
direction
from 
which 
the 
shouting 
came. 
He 
felt 
both 
frightened 
and 
pleased 
to 
be
riding<p>
alone 
with 
three 
hussars 
into 
<a href="/cZl/Xo8fnBp1EPTad8Cr.html">that</a> 
mysterious 
and 
dangerous 
misty
distance 
where 
no 
one 
had 
been 
before 
him. 
Bagration 
called 
to 
him 
from
the 
hill 
not 
to 
go 
beyond 
the 
stream, 
but 
Rostov 
pretended 
not 
to 
hear
him 
and 
did 
not 
stop 
but 
rode 
on 
and 
on, 
continually 
mistaking 
bushes
for 
trees 
and 
gullies 
for 
men 
and 
continually 
discovering
