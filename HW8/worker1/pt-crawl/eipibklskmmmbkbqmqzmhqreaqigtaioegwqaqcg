"The

<a href="/aVzUge/Hqk4G5DduKC9ven.html">left,</a> 
he 
is 
here, 
and 
an 
order 
will 
be 
issued
concerning 
you," 
said 
the 
superintendent 
of 
police. 
"Go 
on!" 
he 
ordered
his 
coachman.

The 
crowd 
halted, 
pressing 
around 
those 
who 
had 
heard 
what 
the
superintendent 
had 
said, 
and 
looking 
at 
the 
departing 
trap.

The 
superintendent 
of 
police 
turned 
round 
at 
that 
moment 
with 
a 
scared
look, 
said 
something 
to 
his 
coachman, 
and 
his 
<a href="/aVzUge/rw7m8bju5FWU.html">horses</a> 
increased 
their
speed.

"It's 
a 
fraud, 
lads! 
Lead 
the 
way 
to 
him, 
himself!" 
shouted 
the 
tall
youth. 
"Don't 
let 
him 
go, 
lads! 
Let 
him 
answer 
us!<p>
Keep 
him!"<p>
shouted
different 
people 
and 
the 
people 
dashed 
in 
<a href="/aVzUge/bmp3Url9qrwB.html">pursuit</a> 
of 
the 
trap.

Following 
the 
superintendent 
of 
police 
and 
talking 
loudly 
the 
crowd 
went
in 
the 
direction 
of 
the 
Lubyanka 
Street.

"There 
now, 
the 
gentry 
and 
merchants 
have 
gone 
away 
and 
left 
us 
to
perish. 
Do 
they 
think 
we're 
dogs?" 
voices 
in 
the 
crowd 
were 
heard 
saying
more 
and 
more 
frequently.





CHAPTER 
XXIV

On 
the 
evening 
of 
the 
first 
of 
September, 
after 
his 
interview 
with
Kutuzov, 
Count 
Rostopchin 
had 
returned 
to 
Moscow 
mortified 
and 
offended
because 
he 
had 
not 
been 
invited 
to 
attend 
the 
council 
of 
war, 
and
because 
Kutuzov 
had 
paid 
no 
attention 
to 
his 
offer 
to 
take 
part 
in 
the
defense 
of 
the 
city; 
amazed 
also 
at 
the 
novel 
outlook 
revealed 
to 
him
at 
the 
camp, 
which 
treated<p>
the 
tranquillity 
of 
the 
capital 
and 
its
patriotic 
fervor 
as 
not 
merely 
secondary 
but 
quite 
irrelevant 
and
unimportant 
matters.
