xexcvkngoieotkyqaeskteikkqdelaxaeohihaic length 4 4329 page 4329 <h1>The 
gates 
of 
most</h1>of 
the 
houses
were 
locked 
and 
the 
shutters 
up. 
The 
streets 
and 
lanes 
were 
deserted.
The 
air 
was 
full 
of 
smoke 
and 
the 
smell 
of 
burning. 
Now 
and 
then 
he 
met
Russians 
with 
anxious 
and 
timid 
faces, 
and 
Frenchmen 
with 
an 
air 
not 
of
the 
city 
but 
of 
the 
camp, 
walking 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
streets. 
Both
the 
Russians 
and 
the 
French 
looked 
at 
Pierre 
with 
surprise. 
Besides 
his
height 
and 
stoutness, 
and 
the 
strange 
morose 
look 
of 
suffering 
in 
his
face 
and 
whole 
figure, 
the 
Russians 
stared 
at 
Pierre 
because 
they 
could
not 
make 
out 
to 
what 
class 
he 
could 
belong. 
The 
French 
followed<p>
him 
with
astonishment 
in 
their 
eyes 
chiefly 
because 
Pierre, 
unlike 
all 
the
other 
Russians 
who 
gazed 
at 
the 
French 
with 
fear 
and 
curiosity, 
paid 
no
attention 
to 
them. 
At 
the 
gate 
of 
one 
house 
three 
Frenchmen, 
who 
were
explaining 
something 
to 
some 
Russians 
who 
did 
not 
understand 
them,
stopped 
Pierre 
asking 
if 
he 
did 
not 
know 
French.

Pierre 
shook 
his 
head 
and 
went 
on. 
In 
another 
side 
street 
a 
sentinel
standing 
beside 
a 
green 
caisson 
shouted 
at 
him, 
but 
only 
when 
the<p>
shout
was 
threateningly 
repeated 
and 
he 
heard 
the 
click 
of 
the 
man's 
musket 
as
he 
raised 
it 
did 
Pierre 
understand 
that 
he 
had 
to 
pass 
on 
the 
other 
side
of 
the 
street. 
He 
heard 
nothing 
and 
saw 
nothing 
of 
what 
went 
on 
around
him. 
He 
carried 
his 
resolution 
within 
himself 
in 
terror 
and 
haste, 
like
something 
dreadful 
and 
alien 
to 
him, 
for, 
after 
the 
previous 
night's
experience, 
he 
was 
afraid 
of<p>
losing 
it. 
But<p>
he 
was 
not 
destined 
to 
bring
his 
mood 
safely 
to 
his 
destination. 
And 
even 
had 
he 
not 
been 
hindered 
by
anything 
on 
the 
way, 
his 
intention 
could 
not 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ak2v5mbEd1ahj.html">now</a> 
have 
been 
carried 
out,
for 
Napoleon 
had 
passed 
the 
Arbat 
more 
than 
four 
hours 
previously 
on 
his
way 
from 
the 
Dorogomilov 
suburb 
to 
the 
Kremlin, 
and 
was 
now 
sitting 
in
a 
very 
gloomy 
frame 
of 
mind 
in 
a 
royal 
study 
in 
the 
Kremlin, 
giving
detailed 
and 
exact 
orders 
as 
to 
measures 
to 
be 
taken 
immediately
to 
extinguish 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/jl2O0Vd6Yg.html">fire,</a> 
to 
prevent 
looting, 
and 
to 
reassure 
the
inhabitants. 
But 
Pierre 
did 
not 
know 
this; 
he 
was 
entirely 
absorbed
in 
what 
lay 
before 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/SL6ej5WVP7nZs.html">him,</a> 
and 
was<p>
tortured-as 
those 
are 
who 
obstinately
undertake 
a 
task 
that 
is 
impossible 
for 
them 
not 
because 
of 
its
difficulty 
but 
because 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tHL2iU9hxx7.html">of</a> 
its 
incompatibility 
with 
their 
natures-by 
the
fear 
of 
weakening 
at 
the 
decisive 
moment 
and 
so 
losing 
his 
self-esteem.

Though 
he 
heard 
and 
saw 
nothing 
around 
him 
he 
found 
his 
way 
by 
instinct
and 
did 
not 
go 
wrong 
in 
the 
side 
streets 
that 
led<p>
to 
the 
Povarskoy.

As 
Pierre 
approached 
that 
street 
the 
smoke 
became 
denser 
and 
denser-he
even 
felt 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
fire. 
Occasionally 
curly 
tongues 
of 
flame 
rose
from 
under 
the 
roofs 
of 
the 
houses. 
He 
met 
more 
people 
in 
the 
streets
and 
they 
were 
more 
excited. 
But 
Pierre, 
though 
he 
felt 
that 
something
unusual 
was 
happening 
around 
him, 
did 
not 
realize 
that 
he 
was
approaching 
the 
fire. 
As 
he 
was 
going 
along 
a 
footpath 
across 
a
wide-open 
space 
adjoining 
<a href="/aVzUge/Bx6b5BYyw6v.html">the</a> 
Povarskoy 
on 
one 
side 
and 
the 
gardens
of 
Prince 
Gruzinski's 
house 
on 
the<p>
other, 
Pierre 
suddenly 
heard 
the
desperate 
weeping 
of 
a 
woman 
close 
to 
him. 
He 
stopped 
as 
if 
awakening
from 
a 
dream 
and 
lifted 
his 
head.

By 
the 
side 
of 
the 
path, 
on 
the 
dusty 
dry 
grass, 
all 
sorts 
of 
household
goods 
lay 
in 
a 
heap: 
featherbeds, 
a 
samovar, 
icons, 
and 
trunks. 
On 
the
ground, 
beside 
the 
trunks, 
sat 
a 
thin 
woman 
no 
longer 
young, 
with 
long,
prominent 
upper 
teeth, 
and 
wearing 
a 
black 
cloak 
and 
cap. 
This<p>
woman,
swaying 
to 
and 
fro 
and 
muttering 
something, 
was 
choking 
with 
sobs.
