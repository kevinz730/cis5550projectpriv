The 
commander 
in 
chief 
listened 
to 
what 
was 
being 
said
and 
sometimes 
asked 
them 
to 
repeat 
their 
remarks, 
but 
did 
not 
himself
take 
part 
in 
the 
conversations 
or 
express 
any 
opinion. 
After 
hearing
what 
was 
being 
said 
by 
one 
or 
other 
of 
these 
groups 
he 
generally 
turned
away 
with 
an 
air 
of 
disappointment, 
as 
though 
they 
were 
not 
speaking 
of
anything 
he 
wished 
to 
hear. 
Some 
discussed 
the 
position<p>
that 
had 
been
chosen, 
criticizing 
not 
the 
position 
itself 
so 
much 
as 
the 
mental
capacity 
of 
those 
who 
had 
chosen 
it. 
Others 
argued 
that 
a 
mistake 
had
been 
made 
earlier 
and 
that 
a 
battle 
should 
have 
been 
fought 
two 
days
before. 
Others<p>
again 
spoke 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Salamanca, 
which 
was
described 
by 
Crosart, 
a 
newly 
arrived 
Frenchman 
in 
a 
Spanish 
uniform.
(This 
Frenchman 
and 
one 
of 
the 
German 
princes 
serving 
with 
the 
Russian
army 
were 
discussing 
the 
siege 
of 
Saragossa 
and 
considering 
the
possibility 
of 
defending 
Moscow 
in 
a 
similar 
manner.) 
Count 
Rostopchin
was 
telling 
a 
fourth 
group 
that 
he 
was 
prepared 
to 
die 
with 
the 
city
train 
bands 
under 
the 
walls 
of 
the 
capital, 
but 
that 
he 
still 
could 
not
help 
regretting 
having 
been 
left 
in 
ignorance 
of 
what 
was 
happening, 
and
that 
had 
he 
known 
it 
sooner 
things 
would 
have 
been 
different.... 
A
fifth 
group, 
displaying 
the 
profundity 
of 
their 
strategic 
perceptions,
discussed 
the 
direction 
the 
troops 
would 
now 
have 
to 
take. 
A 
sixth 
group
was 
talking 
absolute 
nonsense. 
Kutuzov's 
expression 
grew 
more 
and 
more
preoccupied 
and 
gloomy. 
From 
all<p>
this<p>
talk 
he 
saw 
only 
one 
thing: 
that
to 
defend 
Moscow 
was 
a 
physical 
impossibility 
in<p>
the 
full 
meaning 
of
those 
words, 
that 
is 
to 
say, 
so 
utterly 
impossible 
that 
<a href="/cZl/iP4INZ3gK6BwgT.html">if</a> 
any 
senseless
commander 
were 
to 
give 
orders 
to 
fight, 
confusion 
would 
result 
but 
the
battle 
would 
still 
not 
take 
place. 
It 
would 
not 
take 
place<p>
because 
the
commanders 
not 
merely 
all 
recognized 
the 
position 
to 
be 
impossible, 
but
in 
their 
conversations 
were 
only 
discussing 
what 
would 
happen 
after 
its
inevitable 
abandonment. 
How 
could 
the<p>
commanders 
lead 
their 
troops 
to
a 
field 
of 
battle 
they 
considered 
impossible 
to 
hold? 
The 
lower-grade
officers 
and<p>
even 
the 
soldiers 
(who 
too 
reason) 
also 
considered 
the
position 
impossible 
and 
therefore 
could 
not 
go 
to 
fight, 
fully 
convinced
as 
they 
were 
of 
defeat. 
If 
Bennigsen 
insisted 
on 
the 
position 
being
defended 
and 
others 
still 
discussed 
it, 
the 
question 
was 
no 
longer
important 
in 
itself 
but 
only 
as 
a 
pretext 
for 
disputes 
and 
intrigue.
This 
Kutuzov 
knew 
well.

Bennigsen, 
who 
had 
chosen 
the 
position, 
warmly 
displayed 
his 
Russian
patriotism 
(Kutuzov 
could 
not 
listen 
to 
this 
without 
wincing) 
by
insisting 
that 
Moscow 
must 
be<p>
defended. 
His 
aim 
was 
as 
clear 
as 
daylight
to 
Kutuzov: 
if 
the 
defense 
failed, 
to 
throw 
the 
blame 
on 
Kutuzov 
who 
had
brought 
the 
army 
as 
far 
as 
the 
Sparrow 
Hills 
without 
giving 
battle; 
if
it 
succeeded, 
to 
claim 
the 
success 
as 
his 
own; 
or<p>
if 
battle 
were 
not
given, 
to 
clear 
himself 
of 
the 
crime 
of 
abandoning 
Moscow. 
<a href="/cZl/At7Jk8xt2r.html">But</a> 
this
intrigue 
did 
not 
now 
occupy 
the 
old 
man's 
mind. 
One 
terrible 
question
absorbed 
him 
and 
to 
that 
question 
he 
heard 
no 
reply 
from 
anyone. 
The
question 
for 
him 
now 
was: 
"Have 
I 
really 
allowed 
Napoleon 
to 
reach
Moscow, 
and 
when 
did 
I 
do 
so? 
When 
was 
it 
decided?<p>
Can 
it 
have 
been
yesterday 
when 
I 
ordered 
Platov 
to 
retreat, 
or 
was 
it
