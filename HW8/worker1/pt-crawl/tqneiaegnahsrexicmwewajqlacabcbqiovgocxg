of</h1>you 
now, 
do 
you 
think?"

Pierre 
was 
not 
at 
all 
surprised 
at 
this 
question. 
He 
understood<p>
his
wife's 
line 
of 
thought.

"Platon 
Karataev?" 
he 
repeated, 
and 
pondered, 
evidently 
sincerely
trying 
to 
imagine 
Karataev's 
opinion 
on 
the 
subject. 
"He 
would 
not 
have
understood... 
yet 
perhaps 
he 
would."

"I 
love 
you 
awfully!" 
Natasha 
suddenly 
said. 
"Awfully, 
awfully!"

"No, 
he 
would 
not 
have 
approved," 
said 
Pierre, 
<a href="/cZl/IMv9i5SXnSa2fCtXF.html">after</a> 
reflection. 
"What
he 
would 
have 
approved 
of 
is 
our 
family 
life. 
He 
was 
always 
so 
anxious
to 
find<p>
seemliness, 
happiness, 
and 
peace 
in 
everything, 
and 
I 
should
have 
been 
proud 
to 
let 
him 
see 
us. 
There 
now-you 
talk 
of 
my 
absence,
but 
you 
wouldn't 
believe 
what 
a 
special 
feeling 
I 
have 
for 
you 
<a href="/nocrawl/aVzUge/WD1iCtOt0m0t.html">after</a> 
a
separation...."

"Yes, 
I 
should 
think..." 
Natasha 
began.

"No, 
it's 
not 
that. 
I 
never 
leave 
off 
loving 
you. 
And 
one 
couldn't 
love
more, 
but 
this 
is 
something 
<a href="/cZl/Xj19Ujvc9DLq.html">special....</a> 
Yes, 
of 
course-" 
he 
did 
not
finish 
because 
their 
eyes 
meeting 
said 
the 
rest.
