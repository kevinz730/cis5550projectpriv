the
marshal. 
An 
hour</h1>later 
a 
squad 
of 
soldiers 
arrived 
and 
Pierre 
with
thirteen 
others 
was 
led 
to 
the 
Virgin's 
Field. 
It 
was 
a 
fine 
day, 
sunny
after 
rain, 
and 
the 
air 
was 
unusually 
pure. 
The 
smoke 
did 
not 
hang 
low
as 
on 
the 
day 
when 
Pierre 
had 
been 
taken 
from 
the 
guardhouse 
on 
the
Zubovski 
rampart, 
but 
rose 
through 
the 
pure 
air 
in 
columns. 
No 
flames
were 
seen, 
but 
columns<p>
of 
smoke 
rose 
on 
all 
sides, 
and 
all 
Moscow<p>
as 
far
as 
Pierre 
could 
see 
was 
one 
vast 
charred 
ruin. 
On 
all 
sides 
there 
were
waste 
spaces 
with 
only 
stoves 
and 
chimney 
stacks 
still 
standing, 
and
here 
and 
there 
the 
blackened 
walls 
of 
some 
brick 
houses. 
Pierre 
gazed
at 
the 
ruins 
and 
did 
not 
recognize 
districts 
he 
had 
known 
well. 
Here 
and
there 
he 
could 
see 
churches 
that 
had 
not 
been 
burned. 
The 
Kremlin, 
which
was 
not 
destroyed, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NI5dBoY8m.html">gleamed</a> 
white 
in 
the 
distance 
with 
its 
towers 
and
the 
belfry 
of 
Ivan 
the 
Great. 
The 
domes 
of 
the 
New 
Convent 
of 
the 
Virgin
glittered 
brightly 
and 
its 
bells 
were 
ringing 
particularly 
clearly.
These 
bells 
reminded 
Pierre 
that 
it 
was 
Sunday 
and 
the 
feast 
of 
the
Nativity 
of 
the 
Virgin. 
But 
there 
seemed 
to 
be 
no 
one 
to 
celebrate 
this
holiday: 
everywhere 
were 
blackened 
ruins, 
and 
the 
few 
Russians 
to 
be
seen 
were<p>
tattered 
and 
frightened 
people 
who 
tried 
to 
hide 
when 
they 
saw
the 
French.

It 
was 
plain 
that 
the 
Russian 
<a href="/cZl/Wj2NDX9oP3vuxZ.html">nest</a> 
was 
ruined 
and 
destroyed, 
but 
in
place 
of<p>
the 
Russian 
order 
of 
life 
that 
had 
been 
destroyed, 
Pierre
unconsciously 
felt 
that 
a 
quite 
different, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/kI50jl0AHAK.html">firm,</a> 
French 
order 
had 
been
established 
over 
this 
ruined 
nest. 
He 
felt 
this 
in 
the 
looks 
of
the 
soldiers 
who, 
marching 
in 
regular 
ranks 
briskly 
and 
gaily, 
were
escorting 
him 
and 
the 
other 
criminals; 
he 
felt 
it 
in 
the 
looks 
of 
an
important 
French 
official 
in 
a 
carriage 
and 
pair 
driven 
by 
a 
soldier,
whom 
they 
met 
on 
the 
way. 
He 
felt 
it 
in 
the 
merry 
sounds 
of 
regimental
music 
he 
heard 
from 
the 
left 
side 
of 
the 
field, 
and 
felt 
and 
realized
it 
especially 
from 
the 
list 
of 
prisoners 
the 
French 
officer 
had 
read 
out
when 
he 
came 
that 
morning.<p>
Pierre 
had 
been 
taken 
by 
one 
set 
of 
soldiers
and 
led 
first 
to 
one 
and 
then 
to 
another 
place 
with 
dozens 
of 
other 
men,
and 
it 
seemed 
that 
they 
might 
have 
forgotten 
him, 
or 
confused 
him 
with
the 
others. 
But 
no: 
the 
answers 
he 
had 
given 
when 
questioned 
had 
come
back 
to 
him 
in 
his 
designation 
as 
"the 
man 
who 
does 
not 
give 
his 
name,"
and 
under 
that 
appellation, 
which 
to 
Pierre 
seemed 
terrible, 
they 
were
now 
leading<p>
him 
somewhere 
with 
unhesitating 
assurance 
on 
their 
faces
that 
he 
and 
all 
the 
other 
prisoners 
<a href="/aVzUge/iO5ieowf7qUgk2AzQCY.html">were</a> 
exactly 
the 
ones 
they 
wanted
and 
that 
they 
were 
being 
taken 
to 
the 
proper 
place. 
Pierre 
felt 
himself
to 
be 
an 
insignificant 
chip 
fallen 
among 
the 
wheels 
of 
a 
machine 
whose
action 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
but 
which 
was 
working 
well.

He 
and 
the 
other 
prisoners 
were 
taken 
to 
the 
right 
side 
of 
the 
Virgin's
Field, 
to 
a 
large 
white 
house 
with 
an 
immense 
garden 
not 
far 
from 
the
convent. 
This 
was 
Prince 
Shcherbatov's 
house, 
where 
Pierre 
had 
often
been 
in 
other 
days, 
and 
which, 
as 
he 
learned 
from 
the 
talk 
of 
the
soldiers, 
was 
now 
occupied 
by 
the 
marshal, 
the 
Duke 
of 
Eckmuehl 
(Davout).

They 
were 
taken 
to 
the 
entrance 
and 
led 
into 
the 
house 
one 
by 
one.
Pierre 
was 
the 
sixth 
to 
enter. 
He 
was 
conducted 
through 
a 
glass 
gallery,
an 
anteroom, 
and 
a 
hall, 
which 
were 
familiar 
to 
him, 
into 
a 
long 
low
study 
at 
the 
door
