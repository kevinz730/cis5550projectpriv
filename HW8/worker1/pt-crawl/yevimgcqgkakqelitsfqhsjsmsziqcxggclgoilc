CHAPTER 
VII

On 
the 
twelfth 
of 
November, 
Kutuzov's 
active 
army, 
in 
camp 
before
Olmuetz, 
was 
preparing 
to 
be 
reviewed 
next 
day 
by 
the 
two 
Emperors-the
Russian 
and 
the 
Austrian. 
The 
Guards, 
just 
arrived 
from 
Russia, 
spent
the 
night 
ten 
miles 
from 
Olmuetz 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NI5dBoY8m.html">and</a> 
next 
morning 
were 
to 
come 
straight
to 
the 
review, 
reaching 
the 
field 
at 
Olmuetz 
by 
ten 
o'clock.

That 
day 
Nicholas 
Rostov 
received 
a 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Kt1fqZYy6E2U.html">letter</a> 
from 
Boris, 
telling 
him
that 
the 
Ismaylov 
regiment 
was 
quartered 
for 
the 
night 
ten 
miles 
from
Olmuetz 
and 
that 
he 
wanted 
to 
see 
him 
as 
he 
had 
a 
letter 
and 
money 
for
him. 
Rostov 
was 
particularly 
in 
need 
of 
money 
now 
that 
the 
troops,
after 
their 
active 
service, 
were 
stationed 
near 
Olmuetz 
and 
the 
camp
swarmed 
with 
well-provisioned 
sutlers 
and 
Austrian 
Jews 
offering
all 
sorts 
of 
tempting 
wares. 
The 
Pavlograds 
held 
feast 
after 
feast,
celebrating 
awards 
they 
had 
received 
for 
the 
campaign, 
and 
made
expeditions 
to 
Olmuetz 
to 
visit 
a 
certain 
Caroline 
the 
Hungarian,
who 
had 
recently 
opened 
a 
restaurant 
there 
with 
girls 
as 
waitresses.
Rostov, 
who 
had 
just 
celebrated 
his 
promotion 
to 
a 
cornetcy 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bUI9RijOU2QrO7iY.html">and</a> 
bought
Denisov's 
horse, 
Bedouin, 
was 
in 
debt 
all 
round, 
to 
his 
comrades 
and
the 
sutlers. 
On 
receiving 
Boris' 
letter 
he 
rode 
with 
a 
fellow 
officer
to 
Olmuetz, 
dined 
there, 
drank 
a 
bottle 
of 
wine, 
and 
then 
set 
off 
alone
to 
the 
Guards' 
camp 
to 
find 
his<p>
old 
playmate. 
Rostov 
had 
not 
yet 
had
time 
to 
get 
his 
uniform. 
He 
had 
on 
a 
shabby 
cadet 
jacket, 
decorated 
with
a 
soldier's 
cross, 
equally 
shabby 
cadet's 
riding 
breeches 
lined 
with
worn 
leather, 
and 
an 
officer's 
saber 
with 
a 
sword 
knot. 
The 
Don 
horse
he 
was 
riding 
was 
one 
he 
had 
bought 
from 
a 
Cossack
