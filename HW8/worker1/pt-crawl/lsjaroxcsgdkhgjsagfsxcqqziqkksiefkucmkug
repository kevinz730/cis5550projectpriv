she 
wanted 
to 
have 
a 
talk 
with 
him, 
led 
him 
to
her 
sitting 
room, 
from 
which 
those 
who 
were 
there 
immediately 
withdrew
so 
as 
not 
to 
be 
in 
her 
way.

"Do 
you 
know, 
dear 
boy," 
began 
the 
governor's 
wife 
with 
a 
serious
expression 
on 
her 
kind 
little 
face, 
"that<p>
really 
would 
be 
the 
match 
for
you: 
would 
you 
like 
me 
to 
arrange 
it?"

"Whom 
do 
you 
mean, 
Aunt?" 
asked 
Nicholas.

"I 
will 
make 
a 
match 
for 
you 
with 
the 
princess.<p>
Catherine 
Petrovna
speaks 
of 
Lily, 
but 
I 
say, 
no-the 
princess! 
Do 
you 
want 
me 
to 
do 
it? 
I
am 
sure 
your 
mother 
will 
be 
grateful 
to 
me. 
What 
a 
charming 
girl 
she 
is,
really! 
And 
she 
is 
not 
at 
all 
so 
plain, 
either."

"Not 
at 
all," 
replied 
Nicholas 
as 
if 
offended 
at 
the 
idea. 
"As 
befits
a 
soldier, 
Aunt, 
I 
don't 
force 
myself 
on 
anyone 
or 
refuse 
anything," 
he
said 
before 
he 
had 
time 
to 
consider 
what 
he 
was 
saying.

"Well<p>
then, 
remember, 
this 
is 
not 
a 
joke!"

"Of 
course 
not!"

"Yes, 
yes," 
the 
governor's 
wife 
said 
as 
if 
talking 
to 
herself. 
"But,
my 
dear 
boy, 
among 
other 
things 
you 
are 
too 
attentive 
to 
the 
other, 
the
blonde. 
One 
is 
sorry 
for 
the 
husband, 
really...."

"Oh 
no, 
we 
are 
good 
friends 
with 
him," 
said 
Nicholas 
in 
<a href="/cZl/nZs6gcnoA49FW.html">the</a> 
simplicity
of 
his 
heart; 
it 
did 
not 
enter 
his 
head 
that 
a 
pastime 
so 
pleasant 
to
himself 
might 
not 
be 
pleasant 
to 
someone 
else.

"But 
what 
nonsense 
I 
have 
been 
saying 
to 
the 
governor's 
wife!" 
thought
Nicholas 
suddenly 
at 
supper. 
"She 
will 
really 
begin 
to 
arrange 
a
match... 
and 
Sonya...?" 
And 
on 
taking 
leave 
of 
the 
governor's 
wife,
when 
she 
again 
smilingly 
said 
to 
him, 
"Well 
then, 
remember!" 
he 
drew 
her
aside.

"But 
see 
here, 
to 
tell 
the 
truth, 
Aunt..."

"What 
is 
it, 
my 
dear? 
Come, 
let's 
sit 
down 
here," 
said 
she.

Nicholas 
suddenly 
felt 
a 
desire 
and 
need 
to 
tell 
his 
most 
intimate
thoughts 
(which 
he 
would 
not 
have 
told 
to 
his 
mother, 
his 
sister, 
or
his 
friend) 
to 
this 
woman 
who 
was<p>
almost 
a 
stranger. 
When 
he 
afterwards
recalled 
that 
impulse 
to 
unsolicited 
and 
inexplicable 
frankness 
which
had 
very 
important 
results 
for 
him, 
it 
seemed 
to 
him-as 
it 
seems 
to
everyone 
in 
such 
cases-that 
it 
was 
merely 
some 
silly 
whim 
that 
seized
him: 
yet 
that 
burst 
of 
frankness, 
together 
with 
other 
trifling 
events,
had 
immense 
consequences 
for 
him 
and 
for 
all 
his 
family.

"You 
see, 
Aunt, 
Mamma 
has 
long 
wanted 
me 
to 
marry 
an 
heiress, 
but 
the
very 
idea 
of 
marrying 
for 
money<p>
is 
repugnant 
to 
me."

"Oh 
yes, 
I 
understand," 
said 
the 
governor's 
wife.

"But 
Princess 
Bolkonskaya-that's 
another 
matter.<p>
I 
will 
tell 
you 
the
truth. 
In 
the 
first 
place 
I 
like 
her 
very 
much, 
I 
feel 
drawn 
to 
her; 
and
then, 
after 
I 
met 
her 
under<p>
such 
circumstances-so 
strangely, 
the 
idea
often 
occurred 
to 
me: 
'This 
is 
fate.' 
Especially 
if 
you 
remember 
that
Mamma 
had 
long 
been 
thinking 
of 
it; 
but 
I 
had 
never 
happened 
to 
meet 
her
before, 
somehow 
it 
had 
always 
happened 
that 
we 
did 
not 
meet. 
And 
as 
long
as 
my 
sister 
Natasha 
was 
engaged<p>
to 
her 
brother 
it 
was 
of 
course 
out 
of
the 
question 
for 
me 
to 
think 
of 
marrying 
her. 
And 
it 
must 
needs 
happen
that 
I 
should 
meet 
her 
just 
when 
Natasha's 
engagement
