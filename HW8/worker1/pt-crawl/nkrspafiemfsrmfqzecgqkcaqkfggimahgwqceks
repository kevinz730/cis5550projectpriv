Before 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino 
our 
strength 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
French
was 
about 
as 
five 
to 
six, 
but 
after 
that 
battle 
it 
was 
little 
more 
<a href="/aVzUge/OH80CyE7uR.html">than
one</a> 
to 
two: 
previously 
we 
had 
a 
hundred 
thousand 
against 
a 
hundred 
and
twenty<p>
thousand; 
afterwards 
little 
more 
than 
fifty 
thousand 
against 
a
hundred 
thousand. 
Yet 
the<p>
shrewd 
and 
experienced 
Kutuzov 
accepted 
the
battle, 
while 
Napoleon, 
<a href="/aVzUge/suD4UHdX4suDcq6GBhrH.html">who</a> 
was 
said 
to 
be 
a 
commander 
of 
genius,
gave 
it, 
losing 
a 
quarter 
of 
his 
army 
and 
lengthening 
his 
lines 
of
communication 
still 
more. 
If 
it 
is 
said 
that 
he 
expected 
to 
end 
the
campaign 
by 
occupying 
Moscow 
as 
he 
had 
ended 
a 
previous 
campaign 
by
occupying 
Vienna, 
there 
is 
much 
evidence 
to 
the 
contrary.
