"Pass 
on,</h1>pass 
on!" 
the 
captain 
reiterated, 
frowning 
sternly, 
and
looking 
at 
the 
prisoners 
who 
<a href="/aVzUge/lX3eplAZ1Im2mGGRm.html">thronged</a> 
past 
him.

Pierre 
went 
up 
<a href="/cZl/dA2tQI5SC4.html">to</a> 
him, 
though 
he<p>
knew 
his 
attempt 
would 
be 
vain.

"What 
now?" 
the 
officer 
asked 
with 
a 
cold 
look 
as 
if 
not 
recognizing
Pierre.

Pierre 
told 
him 
about 
the 
sick 
man.

"He'll 
manage 
to 
walk, 
devil 
take 
him!" 
said 
the 
captain. 
"Pass 
on, 
pass
on!" 
he 
continued 
without 
looking 
at 
Pierre.

"But 
he 
is 
dying," 
Pierre 
again 
began.

"Be 
so 
good..." 
shouted 
the 
captain, 
frowning 
angrily.

"Dram-da-da-dam, 
dam-dam..." 
rattled 
the 
drums, 
and 
Pierre 
understood
that 
this 
mysterious 
force 
completely 
controlled 
these 
men 
and 
that 
it
was 
now 
useless 
to 
say 
any 
more.

The 
officer 
prisoners 
were 
separated 
from 
the 
soldiers 
and 
told 
to 
march
in 
front. 
There 
were 
about 
thirty 
officers, 
with 
Pierre 
among 
them, 
and
about 
three 
hundred 
men.

The 
officers, 
who 
had 
come 
from 
the 
other 
sheds, 
were 
all 
strangers 
to
Pierre 
and 
much 
better 
dressed<p>
than 
he. 
They 
looked 
at 
him 
and 
at 
his
shoes 
mistrustfully, 
as 
at 
an 
alien. 
Not 
far 
from 
him 
walked 
a 
fat 
major
with 
a 
sallow, 
bloated, 
angry 
face, 
who 
was 
wearing 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mM4sVDPn5bE7EwE.html">a</a> 
Kazan 
dressing
gown 
tied 
round 
with 
a 
towel, 
and 
who 
evidently 
enjoyed 
the 
respect 
of
his 
fellow 
prisoners. 
He 
kept 
one 
hand, 
in 
which 
he 
clasped 
his 
tobacco
pouch, 
inside 
the 
bosom 
of 
his 
dressing 
gown 
and 
held 
the 
stem 
of 
his
pipe 
firmly 
with 
the 
other. 
Panting 
and 
puffing, 
the 
major 
grumbled<p>
and
growled 
at 
everybody 
because 
he 
thought 
he<p>
was 
being 
pushed 
and 
that
they 
were 
all 
hurrying 
when 
they 
had 
nowhere 
to 
hurry 
to 
and 
were
all 
surprised 
at 
something 
when 
there 
was 
nothing 
to 
be 
surprised 
at.
Another, 
a 
thin 
little 
officer, 
was 
speaking 
to 
everyone, 
conjecturing
where 
they 
were 
now 
being 
taken 
and 
how 
far 
they 
would 
get 
that 
day. 
An
official 
in 
felt 
boots 
and 
wearing 
a 
commissariat 
uniform 
ran 
round 
from
side 
to 
side 
and 
gazed 
at 
the 
ruins 
<a href="/cZl/uI3zT3Dj7dS.html">of</a> 
Moscow, 
loudly 
announcing 
his
observations 
as 
to 
what 
had 
been 
burned 
down 
and 
what 
this 
or 
that 
part
of 
the 
city 
was
