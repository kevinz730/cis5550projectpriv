what 
are 
we 
waiting 
for?</h1>I 
ask 
just 
one
thing 
of 
you, 
cousin," 
she 
went 
on, 
"arrange 
for 
me 
to 
be 
taken 
to
Petersburg. 
Whatever 
I 
may 
be, 
I 
can't 
live 
under 
Bonaparte's 
rule."

"Oh, 
come, 
ma 
cousine! 
Where 
do 
you 
get 
your 
information 
from? 
On 
the
contrary..."

"I 
won't 
submit 
to 
your 
Napoleon! 
Others 
may 
if 
they 
please.... 
If 
you
don't 
want 
to 
do 
this..."

"But 
I 
will, 
I'll 
give 
the 
order 
at 
once."

The 
princess 
was 
apparently 
vexed 
at 
not 
having 
anyone 
to 
be 
angry 
with.
Muttering 
to 
herself, 
she 
sat 
down 
on 
a 
chair.

"But 
you 
have 
been 
misinformed," 
said 
Pierre. 
"Everything 
is 
quiet 
in
the 
city 
and 
there 
is 
not 
the 
slightest 
danger. 
See! 
I've 
just 
been
reading..." 
He 
showed 
her 
the 
broadsheet. 
"Count 
Rostopchin 
writes 
that
he 
will 
stake 
his 
life 
on 
it 
that 
the 
enemy 
will 
not 
enter 
Moscow."

"Oh, 
that 
count 
of 
yours!" 
said 
the 
princess 
malevolently. 
"He 
is 
a
hypocrite, 
a 
rascal 
who 
has 
himself 
roused 
the 
people 
to 
riot. 
Didn't
he 
write 
in 
those 
idiotic 
broadsheets 
that 
anyone, 
'whoever 
it 
might 
be,
should 
be 
dragged 
to 
the 
lockup 
by 
his 
hair'? 
(How 
silly!) 
'And 
honor
and 
glory 
to 
whoever 
captures 
him,' 
he 
says. 
This 
is 
what 
his 
cajolery
has 
brought 
us 
to! 
Barbara 
Ivanovna 
told 
me 
the 
mob 
near 
killed 
her
because 
she 
said 
something 
in 
French."

"Oh, 
but 
it's 
so... 
You 
take 
everything 
so 
to 
heart," 
said 
Pierre, 
and
began 
laying 
out 
his 
cards 
for 
patience.

Although 
that 
patience 
did 
come 
out, 
Pierre 
did 
not 
join 
the 
army,
but 
remained 
in 
deserted 
Moscow 
ever 
in 
the 
same 
state 
of 
agitation,
irresolution, 
and 
alarm, 
yet 
at 
the 
same 
time 
joyfully 
expecting
something 
terrible.

Next 
day 
toward 
evening 
the 
princess 
set 
off, 
and 
Pierre's 
head 
steward
came 
to 
inform 
him 
that 
the 
money 
needed 
for 
the 
equipment 
of 
his
regiment 
could 
not 
be 
found 
without 
selling 
one 
of 
the 
estates. 
In
general 
the 
head 
steward 
made 
out 
to 
Pierre 
that 
his 
project 
of 
raising
a 
regiment 
would 
ruin 
him. 
Pierre 
listened 
to 
him, 
scarcely 
able 
to
repress 
a 
smile.

"Well 
then, 
sell 
it," 
said 
he. 
"What's 
to 
be 
done? 
I 
can't 
draw 
back
now!"

The 
worse 
everything 
became, 
especially 
his 
own 
affairs, 
the 
better
was<p>
Pierre 
pleased 
and 
the 
more 
evident 
was<p>
it 
that 
the 
catastrophe 
he
expected 
was 
approaching. 
Hardly 
anyone 
he 
knew 
was 
left 
in 
town. 
Julie
had 
gone, 
and 
so 
had 
Princess 
Mary. 
Of 
his 
intimate 
friends 
only 
the
Rostovs 
remained, 
but 
he 
did 
not 
go 
to 
see 
them.

To 
distract 
his 
thoughts 
he 
drove 
that 
day 
to 
the 
village 
of 
Vorontsovo
to 
see 
the 
great 
balloon 
Leppich 
was 
constructing 
to 
destroy 
the 
foe,
and 
a 
trial 
<a href="/aVzUge/jE3A9PFi4byQW.html">balloon</a> 
that 
was 
to 
go 
up 
next 
day. 
The 
balloon 
was 
not 
yet
ready, 
but 
Pierre 
learned 
that 
it 
was 
being 
constructed 
by 
the 
Emperor's
desire. 
The 
Emperor 
had 
written 
to 
Count 
Rostopchin 
as 
follows:

As 
soon 
as 
Leppich 
is 
ready, 
get 
together 
a 
crew 
of 
reliable 
and
intelligent 
men 
for 
his 
car 
and 
send 
a 
courier 
to 
General 
Kutuzov 
to 
let
him 
know. 
I 
have 
informed 
him 
of 
the 
matter.

Please 
impress 
upon 
Leppich 
to 
be 
very 
careful 
where 
he 
descends 
for
the 
first 
time, 
that 
he 
may 
not 
make 
a 
mistake 
and 
fall 
into 
the 
enemy's
hands. 
It 
is 
essential 
for 
him 
to 
combine 
his 
movements 
with 
those 
of
the 
commander 
in 
chief.


On 
his 
way 
home 
from 
Vorontsovo, 
as 
he 
was 
passing 
the 
Bolotnoe 
Place
Pierre, 
seeing 
a 
large 
crowd<p>
round 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/kp76v8dkSm.html">Lobnoe</a> 
Place, 
stopped 
and 
got 
out
of 
his 
trap. 
A 
French 
cook 
accused 
of 
being 
a 
spy 
was 
being 
flogged. 
The
flogging 
was 
only 
just 
over, 
and 
the 
executioner 
was 
releasing 
from 
the
flogging 
bench 
a 
stout 
man
