go</h1>a 
greater
distance 
than 
they 
had 
already 
traversed, 
before 
they<p>
reached 
the
frontier.

This 
longing 
to 
distinguish 
themselves, 
to 
maneuver, 
to 
overthrow, 
and
to 
cut 
off 
showed 
itself 
particularly 
whenever 
the 
Russians 
stumbled 
on
the 
French 
army.

So 
it 
was 
at 
Krasnoe, 
where 
they 
expected 
to 
find 
one 
of 
the 
three
French 
columns 
and 
stumbled 
instead 
on 
Napoleon 
himself 
with 
sixteen
thousand 
men. 
Despite 
all 
Kutuzov's 
efforts 
to 
avoid 
that 
ruinous
encounter 
and 
to 
preserve 
his 
troops, 
the 
massacre 
of 
the 
broken 
mob
of 
French 
soldiers 
by 
worn-out 
Russians 
continued 
at 
Krasnoe 
for 
three
days.

Toll 
wrote 
a 
disposition: 
"The 
first 
column 
will 
march 
to 
so 
and 
so,"
etc. 
And 
as 
usual 
nothing 
happened 
in 
accord 
with 
the 
disposition.
Prince 
Eugene 
of 
Wuerttemberg 
fired 
from 
a 
hill 
over 
the 
French 
crowds
that 
were 
running 
past, 
and 
demanded 
reinforcements 
which 
did 
not
arrive. 
The 
French, 
avoiding 
the 
Russians, 
dispersed 
and 
hid 
themselves
in 
the 
forest 
by 
night, 
making 
their 
way 
round 
as 
best 
they 
could, 
and
continued 
their 
flight.

Miloradovich, 
who 
said 
he 
did 
not 
want 
to 
know 
anything 
about 
the
commissariat 
affairs 
of 
his 
detachment, 
and 
could 
never 
be 
found 
when
he 
was 
wanted-that 
chevalier 
sans 
peur 
et 
sans 
reproche 
* 
as 
he 
styled
himself-who 
was 
fond 
of 
parleys 
with 
the 
French, 
sent 
envoys 
demanding
their 
surrender, 
wasted 
time, 
and 
did 
not 
do 
what 
he 
was 
ordered 
to 
do.

Knight 
without 
fear 
and 
without 
reproach.

"I 
give 
you 
that 
column, 
lads," 
he 
said, 
riding 
up 
to 
the 
troops 
and
pointing 
out 
the 
French 
to 
the 
cavalry.

And 
the 
cavalry, 
with 
spurs 
and 
sabers 
urging 
on 
horses 
that 
could
scarcely 
move, 
trotted 
with 
much 
effort 
to 
the 
column 
presented
to 
them-that 
is 
to 
say, 
to 
a 
crowd 
of 
Frenchmen 
stark 
with 
cold,
frost-bitten, 
and 
starving-and 
the 
column 
that 
had 
been 
presented 
to
them 
threw 
down 
its 
arms 
and 
surrendered 
as 
it 
had 
long 
been 
anxious 
to
do.

At 
Krasnoe 
they 
took 
twenty-six 
thousand 
prisoners, 
several 
hundred
cannon, 
and 
a 
stick 
called 
a 
"marshal's 
staff," 
and 
disputed 
as 
to 
who
had 
distinguished 
himself 
and 
were 
pleased 
with 
their 
achievement-though
they 
much 
regretted 
not<p>
having 
taken 
Napoleon, 
or 
at 
least 
a 
marshal 
or
a 
hero 
of 
some 
sort, 
and 
reproached 
one 
another 
and 
especially 
Kutuzov
for 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/eQ1YyaBP2tQI5Qz.html">having</a> 
failed 
to 
do 
so.

These 
men, 
carried 
away 
by 
their 
passions, 
were 
but 
blind 
<a href="/cZl/Ga6ws1ogilO4rhMF.html">tools</a> 
of 
the
most 
melancholy 
law 
of 
necessity, 
but 
considered 
themselves 
heroes 
and
imagined 
that 
they 
were 
accomplishing 
a 
most 
noble 
and 
honorable
deed. 
They 
blamed 
Kutuzov 
and 
said 
that 
from 
the 
very 
beginning 
of 
the
campaign 
he 
had 
prevented 
their 
vanquishing 
Napoleon, 
that 
he 
thought 
of
nothing 
but 
satisfying 
his 
passions 
and 
would 
not 
advance 
from 
the 
Linen
Factories 
because 
he 
was<p>
comfortable 
there, 
that 
at 
Krasnoe 
he 
checked
the 
advance 
because 
on 
learning 
that 
Napoleon 
was 
there 
he 
had 
quite
lost 
his 
head, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
probable 
that 
he 
had 
an 
understanding
with 
Napoleon 
and 
had 
been 
bribed 
by 
him, 
and 
so 
on, 
and 
so 
on.

Not 
only 
did 
his 
contemporaries, 
carried 
away 
by 
their 
passions, 
talk
in 
this 
way, 
but 
posterity 
and 
history 
have 
acclaimed 
Napoleon 
as 
grand,
