With

diplomatic 
questions, 
Napoleon 
summoned 
Captain 
<a href="/cZl/oUZ2hOZs4V9TSU.html">Yakovlev,
who</a> 
had 
been 
robbed 
and 
was 
in 
rags 
and 
did 
not 
know 
how 
to 
get 
out 
of
Moscow, 
minutely 
explained 
to 
him 
his 
whole 
policy 
and<p>
his 
magnanimity,
and 
having 
written 
a 
letter 
to 
the 
Emperor 
Alexander 
in 
which 
he
considered 
it 
his 
duty 
to 
inform 
his 
Friend 
and 
Brother 
that 
<a href="/cZl/Db1i1viB5pWxqu.html">Rostopchin

Moscow, 
he 
dispatched 
Yakovlev 
to
Petersburg.

Having 
similarly 
explained 
his 
views 
and 
his 
magnanimity 
to 
Tutolmin, 
he
dispatched 
that 
old 
man 
also 
to 
Petersburg 
to 
negotiate.

With 
regard 
to 
legal 
matters, 
immediately 
after 
the 
fires 
he 
gave 
orders
to 
find 
and 
execute 
the 
incendiaries. 
And 
the 
scoundrel 
Rostopchin 
was
punished 
by 
an 
order 
to 
burn 
down 
his 
houses.
