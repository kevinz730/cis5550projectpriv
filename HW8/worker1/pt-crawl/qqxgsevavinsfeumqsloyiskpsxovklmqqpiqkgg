the

there,

CHAPTER 
I

Absolute 
continuity 
of 
motion 
is 
not 
comprehensible 
to 
the 
human 
mind.
Laws 
of 
motion 
of 
any 
kind 
become 
comprehensible 
to 
man 
only 
when 
he
examines 
arbitrarily 
selected 
elements 
of 
that 
motion; 
but 
at 
the
same 
time, 
a<p>
large 
proportion 
of 
human 
error 
comes 
from 
the 
arbitrary
division 
of 
continuous 
motion 
into 
discontinuous 
elements. 
There 
is 
a
well-known, 
so-called 
sophism 
of 
the 
ancients 
consisting 
in 
this, 
that
Achilles 
could 
never 
catch 
up 
with 
a 
tortoise 
he 
was 
following, 
in 
spite
of 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
traveled 
ten 
times 
as 
fast 
as 
the 
tortoise. 
By
the 
time 
Achilles 
has 
covered 
the 
<a href="/cZl/ju7mo18w.html">distance</a> 
that 
separated 
him 
from 
the
tortoise, 
the 
tortoise 
has 
covered 
one 
tenth 
of 
that 
distance 
ahead
of 
him: 
when 
Achilles 
has 
covered 
that 
tenth, 
the 
tortoise 
has
