Isn't</h1>that 
lovely 
and 
noble! 
Yes, 
very 
noble? 
Isn't 
it?"
asked 
Natasha, 
so 
seriously 
and 
excitedly 
that 
it 
was 
evident 
that 
what
she 
was 
now 
saying 
she 
had 
talked 
of 
before, 
with 
tears.

Rostov 
became 
thoughtful.

"I 
never 
go 
back 
on 
my 
word," 
he<p>
said. 
"Besides, 
Sonya 
is 
so
charming 
that 
only 
a 
fool 
would 
renounce 
such<p>
happiness."

"No, 
no!" 
cried 
Natasha, 
"she 
and 
I 
have 
already 
talked 
it 
over.
We 
knew 
you'd 
say 
so. 
But 
it 
won't 
do, 
because 
you 
see, 
if 
you 
say
that-if 
you 
consider 
yourself 
bound<p>
by 
your 
promise-it 
will 
seem 
as
if 
she 
had 
not 
meant 
it 
seriously. 
It 
makes 
it 
as 
if 
you 
were 
marrying
her 
because 
you 
must, 
and 
that 
wouldn't 
do 
at 
all."

Rostov 
saw 
that 
it 
had 
been 
well 
considered 
by 
them. 
Sonya 
had 
already
struck 
him 
by 
her 
beauty 
on 
the 
preceding 
day. 
Today, 
when 
he 
had 
caught
a 
glimpse 
of 
her, 
she 
seemed 
still 
more 
lovely. 
She 
was 
a 
charming 
girl
of 
sixteen, 
evidently 
passionately 
in 
love 
with 
him 
(he 
did 
not 
doubt
that 
for 
an 
instant). 
Why 
should 
he 
not 
love<p>
her 
now, 
and 
even 
marry
her, 
Rostov 
thought, 
but 
just 
now 
there 
were 
so 
many 
other 
pleasures
and 
interests 
before 
<a href="/aVzUge/If8vZzpo5O4ZUI.html">him!</a> 
"Yes, 
they 
have 
taken 
a 
wise 
decision," 
he
thought, 
"I 
must 
remain 
free."

"Well 
then,<p>
that's 
excellent," 
said 
he. 
"We'll 
talk 
it 
over
later 
on. 
Oh, 
how 
glad 
I 
am 
to 
have 
you!"

"Well, 
and 
are 
you 
still 
true 
to 
Boris?" 
he 
continued.

"Oh, 
what 
nonsense!" 
cried 
Natasha, 
laughing. 
"I 
don't 
think
about 
him 
or 
anyone 
else, 
and 
I 
don't 
want 
anything 
of 
the 
kind."

"Dear 
me! 
Then 
what 
are 
you 
up 
to 
now?"

"Now?" 
repeated 
Natasha, 
and 
a 
happy 
smile 
lit 
up 
her 
face. 
"Have
you 
seen 
Duport?"

"No."

"Not 
seen 
Duport-the 
famous 
dancer?<p>
Well 
then, 
you 
won't
understand. 
That's 
what 
I'm 
up 
to."

Curving 
her 
arms, 
Natasha 
held 
out 
her 
skirts 
as 
dancers 
do, 
ran 
back
a 
few 
steps, 
turned, 
cut 
a 
caper, 
brought 
her 
little 
feet 
sharply
together, 
and 
made 
some 
steps 
on 
the 
very 
tips 
of 
her 
<a href="/aVzUge/Eo4YfX8yG2mrwmb.html">toes.

"See,</a> 
I'm 
standing! 
See!" 
she 
said, 
but 
could 
not 
maintain 
herself
on 
her 
toes 
any 
longer. 
"So 
that's 
what 
I'm 
up 
to! 
I'll 
never
marry 
anyone, 
but 
will 
be 
a 
dancer.<p>
Only 
don't 
tell 
anyone."

Rostov 
laughed 
so 
loud 
and 
merrily 
that 
Denisov, 
in 
his 
bedroom, 
felt
envious 
and 
Natasha 
could 
not 
help 
joining 
in.

"No, 
but 
don't 
you 
think 
it's 
nice?" 
she 
kept 
repeating.

"Nice! 
And 
so 
you 
no 
longer 
wish 
to 
marry 
Boris?"

Natasha 
flared 
up. 
"I 
don't 
want 
to 
marry 
anyone. 
And 
I'll 
tell
him 
so 
when 
I 
see 
him!"

"Dear 
me!" 
said 
Rostov.

"But 
that's 
all 
rubbish," 
Natasha 
chattered 
on. 
"And 
is
Denisov 
nice?" 
she 
asked.

"Yes, 
indeed!"

"Oh, 
well 
then, 
good-by: 
go 
and 
dress. 
Is 
he 
very 
terrible,
Denisov?"

"Why 
terrible?" 
asked 
Nicholas. 
"No, 
Vaska 
is 
a 
splendid
fellow."

"You 
call 
him 
Vaska? 
That's 
funny! 
And 
is 
he 
very 
nice?"

"Very."

"Well 
then, 
be 
quick. 
We'll 
all 
have 
breakfast 
together."

And 
Natasha 
rose 
and 
went 
out 
of 
the 
room 
on 
tiptoe, 
like 
a 
ballet
dancer, 
but 
<a href="/aVzUge/Kt5f6QJprO0sGG.html">smiling</a> 
as 
only 
happy 
girls 
of 
fifteen 
can 
smile. 
When
Rostov 
met 
Sonya 
in 
the 
drawing 
room, 
he 
reddened. 
He 
did 
not 
know
how 
to 
behave 
with 
her. 
The 
evening 
before, 
in 
the 
first 
happy 
moment 
of
meeting, 
they 
had 
kissed 
<a href="/cZl/Gb4w0Cr6rJpLp.html">each</a> 
other,<p>
but 
today 
they 
felt 
it 
could 
not
be 
done; 
he 
felt 
that 
everybody, 
including 
his 
mother 
and 
sisters, 
was
looking 
inquiringly 
at 
him 
and 
watching 
to 
see 
how 
he 
would 
behave
with 
her. 
He 
kissed 
her 
hand 
and 
addressed 
<a href="/aVzUge/nI91hOZs9om.html">her</a> 
not 
as 
thou 
but 
as
you-Sonya. 
But 
their 
eyes 
met 
and 
said 
thou, 
and 
exchanged 
tender
kisses. 
Her 
looks 
asked 
him 
to 
forgive 
her 
for 
having 
dared,
