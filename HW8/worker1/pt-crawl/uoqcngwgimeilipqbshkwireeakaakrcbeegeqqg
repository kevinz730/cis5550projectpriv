I 
would 
have 
gone," 
she</h1>replied
as 
she 
rose 
to 
go 
to 
<a href="/aVzUge/Lc9ikR8XZEHJ7PEuF.html">her</a> 
own 
room.

But 
as 
she 
passed 
the 
sitting 
room 
she 
noticed 
two 
couples<p>
sitting,
one 
pair 
at 
each 
window. 
She 
stopped 
and 
smiled 
scornfully. 
Sonya 
was
sitting 
close 
to 
Nicholas 
who<p>
was 
copying 
out 
some 
verses 
for 
her, 
the
first 
he 
had 
ever 
written. 
Boris 
and 
Natasha 
were 
at 
the 
other 
window
and 
ceased 
talking 
when 
Vera 
entered. 
Sonya 
and 
Natasha 
looked 
at
Vera 
with 
guilty, 
happy 
faces.

It 
was 
pleasant 
and 
touching 
to 
see 
these 
little 
girls 
in 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZV5hW0bZDWZ8GFXfk.html">love;</a> 
but
apparently 
the 
sight 
of 
<a href="/cZl/FvO8NFutM3oFcgw6CS.html">them</a> 
roused<p>
no 
pleasant 
feeling 
in 
Vera.

"How 
often 
have 
I 
asked 
you 
not 
to 
take 
my 
things?" 
she 
said. 
"You
have 
a 
room 
of 
your 
own," 
and 
she 
took 
the 
inkstand 
from 
Nicholas.

"In 
a 
minute, 
in 
a 
minute," 
he 
said, 
dipping 
his 
pen.

"You 
always 
manage 
to 
do 
things 
at 
the 
wrong 
time," 
continued 
Vera.
"You 
came 
rushing 
into 
the 
drawing 
room 
so 
that 
everyone 
felt 
ashamed
of 
you."

Though 
what 
she 
said 
was 
quite 
just, 
perhaps 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bS3VwPy09.html">for</a> 
that 
very 
reason 
no 
one
replied, 
and 
the 
four 
simply 
looked 
at 
one 
another. 
She 
lingered 
in 
the
room 
with 
the 
inkstand 
in 
her 
hand.
