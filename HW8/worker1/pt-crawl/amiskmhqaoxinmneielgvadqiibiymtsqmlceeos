satisfaction. 
He 
had 
hardly 
finished 
speaking
when 
they 
again 
heard 
an 
unexpectedly 
violent 
whistling 
which 
suddenly
ended 
with 
a 
thud 
into 
something 
soft... 
f-f-flop! 
and 
a 
Cossack, 
riding
a 
little 
to 
their 
right 
and 
behind 
the 
accountant, 
crashed 
to 
earth 
with
his 
horse. 
Zherkov 
and 
the 
staff 
<a href="/cZl/Wa5iPTJ71oqw.html">officer</a> 
bent 
over 
their 
saddles 
and
turned 
their 
horses 
away. 
The 
accountant 
stopped, 
facing 
the 
Cossack,
and 
examined 
him 
with 
attentive 
curiosity. 
The 
Cossack 
was 
dead, 
but 
the
horse 
still 
struggled.

Prince 
Bagration 
screwed 
up 
his 
eyes, 
looked 
round, 
and, 
seeing 
the
cause 
of 
the 
confusion, 
turned 
away 
with 
indifference, 
as 
if 
to 
say,
"Is 
it 
worth 
while 
noticing 
trifles?" 
He 
reined 
in 
his 
horse 
with
the 
care 
of 
a 
skillful 
rider 
and, 
slightly 
bending 
over, 
disengaged 
his
saber 
which 
had<p>
caught 
in 
his 
cloak. 
It 
was 
an 
old-fashioned 
saber 
of
a 
kind 
no 
longer 
in 
general 
use. 
Prince 
Andrew 
remembered 
the 
story 
of
Suvorov 
giving 
his 
saber 
to<p>
Bagration 
in<p>
Italy, 
and 
the 
recollection
was 
particularly 
pleasant 
at 
that 
moment. 
They 
had 
reached 
the 
battery
at 
which 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
been 
when 
he 
examined 
the 
battlefield.

"Whose 
company?" 
asked 
Prince 
Bagration 
of 
an 
artilleryman 
standing
by 
the 
ammunition 
wagon.

He 
asked, 
"Whose 
company?" 
but 
he 
really 
meant, 
"Are 
you
frightened 
here?" 
and 
the 
artilleryman 
understood 
him.

"Captain 
Tushin's, 
your 
excellency!" 
shouted 
the 
red-haired,
freckled 
gunner 
in 
a 
merry 
voice, 
standing 
to 
attention.

"Yes, 
yes," 
muttered 
Bagration 
as 
if 
considering 
something, 
and 
he
rode 
past 
the 
limbers 
to 
the 
farthest 
cannon.

As 
he 
approached, 
a 
ringing 
shot 
issued 
from 
it 
deafening 
him 
and 
his
suite, 
and 
in 
the 
smoke 
that 
suddenly 
surrounded 
the 
gun 
they 
could 
see
the 
gunners 
who 
had 
seized 
it 
straining 
to 
roll 
it 
quickly 
back 
to 
its
former 
position. 
A 
huge, 
broad-shouldered 
gunner, 
Number 
One, 
holding
a 
mop, 
his 
legs 
far 
apart, 
sprang 
to 
the 
wheel; 
while 
Number 
Two 
with
a 
trembling 
hand 
placed 
a 
charge 
in 
the 
cannon's 
mouth. 
The 
short,
round-shouldered 
Captain 
Tushin, 
stumbling 
over 
the 
tail 
of 
the 
gun
carriage, 
moved 
forward 
and, 
not 
noticing 
the 
general, 
looked 
out
shading 
his 
eyes 
with 
his 
small 
hand.

"Lift 
it 
two 
lines 
more 
and 
it 
will 
be 
just 
right," 
cried 
he 
in 
a
feeble 
voice 
to 
which 
he 
tried 
to 
impart 
a 
dashing 
note, 
ill-suited 
to
his 
weak 
figure. 
"Number 
Two!" 
he 
squeaked. 
"Fire, 
Medvedev!"

Bagration 
called 
to 
him, 
and 
Tushin, 
raising 
three 
fingers 
to 
his 
cap
with 
a 
bashful 
and 
awkward 
gesture 
not 
at 
all 
like 
a 
military 
salute
but 
like 
a 
priest's 
benediction, 
approached 
the 
general. 
Though
Tushin's 
guns 
had 
been 
intended 
to 
cannonade 
the 
valley, 
he 
was
firing 
incendiary 
balls
