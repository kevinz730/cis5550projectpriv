he 
continually 
looked 
round 
as
if</h1>asking 
everyone 
whether 
he 
was 
doing 
the 
right 
thing. 
After 
the
destruction 
of 
Moscow 
and 
of 
his 
property, 
thrown 
out 
of 
his 
accustomed
groove 
he 
seemed 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vi2Pe7QJprO9e.html">to</a> 
have 
lost 
the 
sense 
of 
his 
own 
significance 
and 
to
feel 
that 
there 
was 
no 
longer 
a 
place 
for 
him 
in 
life.

In 
spite 
of 
her 
one 
desire 
to 
see 
her 
brother 
as 
soon 
as 
possible, 
and
her 
vexation 
that 
at 
the 
moment 
when 
all 
she 
wanted 
was 
to 
see 
him 
they
should 
be 
trying 
to 
entertain 
her 
and 
pretending 
to 
admire 
her 
nephew,
the 
princess 
noticed 
all 
that 
was 
going 
on 
around 
her 
and 
felt 
the
necessity 
of 
submitting, 
for 
a 
time, 
to 
this 
new 
order 
of 
things 
which
she 
had 
entered. 
She 
knew 
it 
to 
be 
necessary, 
and 
though 
it 
was 
hard 
for
her 
she 
was 
not 
vexed 
with 
these 
people.

"This 
is 
my 
niece," 
said 
the 
count, 
introducing 
Sonya-"You 
don't 
know
her, 
Princess?"

Princess 
Mary 
turned 
to 
Sonya 
and, 
trying 
to 
stifle 
the 
hostile
feeling 
that 
arose 
in 
her 
toward 
the 
girl, 
she 
kissed 
her. 
But 
she 
felt
oppressed 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
mood 
of 
everyone 
around 
her 
was 
so 
far
from 
what 
was 
in 
her 
own 
heart.

"Where 
is 
he?" 
she 
asked 
again, 
addressing 
them<p>
all.

"He 
is 
downstairs. 
Natasha 
is 
with 
him," 
answered 
Sonya, 
flushing. 
"We
have 
sent 
to 
ask.<p>
I 
think 
you 
must 
be 
tired, 
Princess."

Tears 
of 
vexation 
showed 
themselves 
in 
Princess 
Mary's 
eyes. 
She 
turned
away 
and 
was 
about 
to 
ask 
the 
countess 
again 
how 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Io4dK9Ujvc.html">go</a> 
to 
him, 
when
light, 
impetuous, 
and 
seemingly 
buoyant 
steps 
were 
heard 
at 
the 
door.
The 
princess 
looked 
round 
and 
saw<p>
Natasha 
coming 
in, 
almost 
running-that
Natasha 
<a href="/cZl/mV9Ook9.html">whom</a> 
she 
had 
liked 
so 
little 
at 
their 
meeting 
in 
Moscow 
long
since.

But 
hardly 
had 
the 
princess 
looked 
at 
Natasha's 
face 
before 
she 
realized
that 
here 
was 
a 
real 
comrade 
in 
her 
grief,<p>
and 
consequently 
a 
friend.
She 
ran 
to 
meet 
her, 
embraced 
her, 
and<p>
began 
to 
cry 
on 
her 
shoulder.

As 
soon 
as 
Natasha, 
sitting 
at 
the 
head 
of 
Prince 
Andrew's 
bed, 
heard
of 
Princess 
Mary's 
arrival, 
she 
softly 
left 
his 
room 
and 
hastened 
to 
her
with 
those 
swift 
steps 
that 
had 
sounded 
buoyant 
to 
Princess 
Mary.

There 
was 
only 
one 
expression 
on 
her 
agitated 
face 
when 
<a href="/nocrawl/cZl/Ikp85UeLS3HPeSU.html">she</a> 
ran 
into 
the
drawing 
room-that 
of 
love-boundless 
love 
for 
him, 
for 
her, 
and 
for 
all
that 
was 
near 
to 
the 
man 
she 
loved; 
and 
of 
pity, 
suffering 
for 
others,
and 
passionate 
desire 
to 
give 
herself 
entirely 
to 
helping 
them. 
It 
was
plain 
that 
at 
that 
moment 
there 
was 
in 
Natasha's 
heart 
no 
thought 
of
herself 
or 
of 
her 
own 
relations 
with 
Prince 
Andrew.

Princess 
Mary, 
with 
her 
acute 
sensibility, 
understood 
all 
this 
at 
the
first 
glance 
at 
Natasha's 
face, 
and<p>
wept 
on 
her 
shoulder 
with 
sorrowful
pleasure.

"Come, 
come 
to 
him, 
Mary," 
said 
Natasha, 
leading 
her 
into 
the 
other
room.

Princess 
Mary 
raised 
her 
head, 
dried 
her 
eyes, 
and 
turned 
to 
Natasha.
She 
felt 
that 
from 
her 
she 
would 
be 
able 
to 
understand 
and 
learn
everything.

"How..." 
she 
began 
her 
question 
but 
stopped 
short.

She 
felt 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
ask, 
or 
to 
answer, 
in 
words.
Natasha's 
face 
and 
eyes 
would 
have 
to 
tell 
her 
all 
more 
clearly 
and
profoundly.

Natasha 
was 
gazing 
at 
her, 
but 
seemed 
afraid 
and 
in 
doubt 
whether 
to 
say
all 
she 
knew 
or 
not; 
she 
seemed 
to 
feel 
that 
before 
those 
luminous 
eyes
which 
penetrated 
into 
the 
very 
depths 
of 
her 
heart, 
it 
was 
impossible
not 
to 
tell 
the 
whole 
truth 
which 
she 
saw. 
And 
suddenly, 
Natasha's 
lips
twitched, 
ugly 
wrinkles 
gathered 
round 
her 
mouth, 
and 
covering 
her 
face
with 
her 
hands 
she 
burst 
into 
sobs.

Princess 
Mary 
understood.

But 
she 
still 
hoped, 
and 
asked, 
in 
words 
she 
herself 
did 
not 
trust:

"But 
how 
is 
his 
wound? 
What 
is 
his 
general 
condition?"

"You, 
you... 
will 
see,"
