where 
that 
welfare 
lies.<p>
And
Rostopchin</h1>now 
knew 
it.

Not 
only 
did<p>
his 
reason 
not 
reproach 
him 
for 
what 
he 
had 
done, 
but
he 
even 
found 
cause 
for 
self-satisfaction 
in 
having 
so 
successfully
contrived 
to 
avail 
himself 
of 
a 
convenient 
opportunity 
to 
punish 
a
criminal 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
pacify 
the 
mob.

"Vereshchagin<p>
was<p>
tried 
and 
condemned 
to 
death," 
thought 
Rostopchin
(though 
the 
Senate 
had 
only 
condemned 
Vereshchagin 
to 
hard 
labor), 
"he
was 
a 
traitor 
and 
a 
spy. 
I 
could 
not 
let 
him 
go 
unpunished 
and 
so 
I 
have
killed 
two 
birds 
with 
one 
stone: 
to 
appease 
the 
mob 
I 
gave 
them 
a 
victim
and 
at<p>
the 
same 
time 
punished 
a 
miscreant."

Having 
reached 
his 
country 
house 
and 
begun 
to 
give 
orders 
about 
domestic
arrangements, 
the 
count 
grew 
quite 
tranquil.

Half 
an 
hour 
later 
he 
was 
driving 
with 
his 
fast 
horses 
across 
the
Sokolniki 
field, 
no 
longer 
thinking 
of 
what 
had 
occurred 
but 
considering
what 
<a href="/aVzUge/fk4C7tA.html">was</a> 
to 
come. 
He 
was 
driving 
to 
the 
Yauza 
bridge 
where 
he 
had 
heard
that 
Kutuzov 
was. 
Count 
Rostopchin 
was 
mentally 
preparing 
the 
angry 
and
stinging 
reproaches 
he 
meant 
to 
address 
to<p>
Kutuzov 
for 
his 
deception. 
He
would 
make 
that 
foxy 
old 
courtier 
feel 
that 
the 
responsibility<p>
for 
all
the 
calamities 
that 
would 
follow 
the 
abandonment 
of 
the 
city 
and 
the
ruin 
of 
Russia 
(as 
Rostopchin 
regarded 
it) 
would 
fall 
upon 
his 
doting
old 
head. 
Planning 
beforehand 
what 
he 
would 
say 
to 
Kutuzov, 
Rostopchin
turned 
angrily 
in 
his 
caleche 
and 
gazed 
sternly 
from 
side 
to 
side.

The 
Sokolniki 
field 
was 
deserted. 
Only 
at 
the 
end 
of 
it, 
in 
front 
of 
the
almshouse 
and 
the 
lunatic 
asylum, 
could 
be 
seen 
some 
people 
in 
white
and 
others 
like 
them 
walking 
singly 
across 
the 
field 
shouting 
and
gesticulating.

One 
of 
these 
was 
running 
to 
cross 
the 
path 
of 
Count 
Rostopchin's
carriage, 
and 
the 
count 
himself, 
his 
coachman, 
and 
his 
dragoons
looked 
with 
vague 
horror 
and 
curiosity 
at 
these 
released 
lunatics 
and
especially 
at 
the 
<a href="/cZl/mf16LgATt.html">one</a> 
running 
toward 
them.

Swaying 
from 
side 
to 
side 
on 
his 
long, 
thin 
legs 
in 
his 
fluttering
dressing 
gown, 
this 
lunatic 
was 
running 
impetuously, 
his 
gaze 
fixed 
on
Rostopchin, 
shouting 
something 
in 
a 
hoarse 
voice 
and 
making 
signs 
to 
him
to 
stop. 
The 
lunatic's 
<a href="/aVzUge/EY78hoZsa0.html">solemn,</a> 
gloomy 
face 
was 
thin 
and 
yellow, 
with
its 
beard<p>
growing<p>
in 
uneven 
tufts. 
His 
black, 
agate 
pupils 
with
saffron-yellow 
whites 
moved 
restlessly 
near 
the 
lower 
eyelids.

"Stop! 
Pull 
up, 
I 
tell 
you!" 
he 
cried 
in 
a<p>
piercing 
voice, 
and 
again
shouted 
something 
breathlessly 
with 
emphatic 
intonations 
and 
gestures.

Coming 
abreast 
of 
the 
caleche 
he 
ran 
beside 
it.

"Thrice 
have 
they 
slain 
me, 
thrice 
have 
I 
risen 
from 
the 
dead. 
They
stoned 
me, 
crucified 
me... 
I 
shall 
rise... 
shall 
rise... 
shall 
rise.
They 
have 
torn 
my 
body. 
The 
kingdom 
of 
God 
will 
be 
overthrown... 
Thrice
will 
I 
overthrow 
it 
and 
thrice 
re-establish 
it!" 
he 
cried, 
raising 
his
voice 
higher 
and 
higher.

Count 
Rostopchin 
suddenly 
grew 
pale 
as 
he 
had 
done 
when 
the 
crowd 
closed
in 
on 
Vereshchagin. 
He 
turned 
away. 
"Go 
fas... 
faster!" 
he 
cried 
in 
a
trembling 
voice 
to 
his 
coachman. 
The 
caleche 
flew 
over 
the 
ground 
as
fast 
as 
the 
horses 
could 
draw 
it, 
but 
for 
a 
long 
time 
Count 
Rostopchin
still 
heard 
the 
insane 
despairing 
screams 
growing 
fainter 
in 
the
distance, 
while 
his 
eyes 
saw 
nothing 
but 
the 
astonished, 
frightened,
bloodstained 
face 
of 
"the 
traitor" 
in 
the 
fur-lined 
coat.

Recent<p>
as 
that 
mental 
picture 
was, 
Rostopchin 
already 
felt 
that 
it 
had
cut 
deep 
into 
his 
heart 
and 
drawn 
blood. 
Even 
now 
he 
felt 
clearly 
that
the 
gory 
trace 
of 
that 
recollection 
would 
not 
pass 
with 
time, 
but 
that
the 
terrible 
memory 
would, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
dwell 
in 
his
