an 
officer, 
disheveled 
and
drenched,</h1>whose 
trousers 
had 
worked 
up 
to 
above 
his 
knees. 
Behind 
him,
standing 
in 
the 
stirrups, 
trotted 
a 
Cossack. 
The 
officer, 
a 
very 
young
lad 
with 
a 
broad 
rosy 
face 
and 
keen 
merry 
eyes, 
galloped 
up 
to 
Denisov
and 
handed 
him<p>
a 
sodden 
envelope.

"From 
the 
general," 
said 
the 
officer. 
"Please 
excuse 
its 
not 
being 
quite
dry."

Denisov, 
frowning, 
took 
the 
envelope 
and 
opened 
it.

"There, 
they 
kept 
telling 
us: 
'It's 
dangerous, 
it's 
dangerous,'"
said 
the 
officer, 
addressing 
the 
esaul 
while 
Denisov 
was 
reading 
the
dispatch. 
"But 
Komarov 
and 
I"-he 
pointed 
to 
the 
Cossack-"were 
prepared.
We 
have 
each 
of 
us 
two 
pistols.... 
But 
what's 
this?" 
he 
asked, 
noticing
the 
French 
drummer 
boy. 
"A 
prisoner? 
You've 
already 
been 
in 
action? 
May
I 
speak 
to 
him?"

"Wostov! 
Petya!" 
exclaimed 
Denisov, 
having 
run 
through 
the 
dispatch.
"Why 
didn't 
you 
say 
who 
you 
were?" 
and 
turning 
with 
a 
smile 
he 
held 
out
his 
hand 
to 
the 
lad.

The 
officer 
was 
Petya 
Rostov.

All 
the 
way 
Petya 
had 
been 
preparing 
himself 
to 
behave 
with 
Denisov 
as
befitted 
a 
grown-up 
man 
and 
an 
officer-without 
hinting 
at 
their 
previous
acquaintance. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
Denisov 
smiled 
at 
him 
Petya 
brightened
up, 
blushed 
with 
pleasure, 
forgot 
the 
official 
manner 
he 
had 
been
rehearsing, 
and 
began 
telling 
him 
how 
he 
had 
already 
been 
in 
a 
battle
near 
Vyazma 
and 
how 
a 
certain 
hussar 
had 
distinguished 
himself 
there.

"Well, 
I 
am 
glad 
to 
see 
you," 
Denisov 
interrupted 
him, 
and 
his 
face
again 
assumed 
its 
anxious 
expression.

"Michael 
Feoklitych," 
said 
he 
to 
the 
esaul, 
"this 
is 
again 
fwom 
that
German, 
you 
know. 
He"-he 
indicated 
Petya-"is 
serving 
under 
him."

And 
Denisov 
told 
the 
esaul 
that 
the 
dispatch 
just 
delivered 
was 
a
repetition 
of 
the 
German 
general's 
demand 
that 
he 
should 
join 
forces
with 
him 
for 
an 
attack 
on 
the 
transport.

"If 
we 
don't 
take 
it 
tomowwow, 
he'll 
snatch 
it 
fwom 
under<p>
our 
noses," 
he
added.

While 
Denisov 
was 
talking 
to 
the 
esaul, 
Petya-abashed 
by<p>
Denisov's
cold 
tone 
and 
supposing 
that 
it 
was 
due 
to<p>
the 
condition 
of 
his
trousers-furtively 
tried 
to 
pull 
them 
down 
under 
his 
greatcoat 
so
that 
no 
one 
should 
notice 
it, 
while 
maintaining 
as 
martial 
an 
air 
as
possible.

"Will 
there 
be 
any 
orders, 
your 
honor?" 
he 
asked 
Denisov, 
holding 
his
hand 
at 
the 
salute 
and 
resuming 
the 
game 
of 
adjutant 
and 
general 
for
which 
he 
had 
prepared 
himself, 
"or 
shall 
I 
remain 
with 
your 
honor?"

"Orders?" 
Denisov 
repeated 
thoughtfully. 
"But
