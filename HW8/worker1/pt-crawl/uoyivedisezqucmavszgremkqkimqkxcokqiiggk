hurriedly 
and 
merrily
began 
to 
devise</h1>and 
carry 
out 
a 
plan 
of 
how 
Princess 
Mary 
should 
be
dressed. 
Princess 
Mary's 
self-esteem 
was 
wounded 
by 
the 
fact 
that
the 
arrival 
of 
a 
suitor 
agitated 
her, 
and 
still 
more 
so 
by 
both
her 
companions' 
not 
having 
the<p>
least 
conception 
that 
it 
could 
be
otherwise. 
To 
tell 
them 
that 
she 
felt 
ashamed 
for 
herself 
and 
for 
them
would 
be 
to 
betray 
her 
agitation, 
while 
to 
decline 
their 
offers 
to
dress 
her 
would 
prolong 
their 
banter 
and 
insistence. 
She 
flushed, 
her
beautiful 
eyes 
grew 
dim, 
red<p>
blotches 
came 
on 
her 
face, 
and 
it 
took
on 
the 
unattractive 
martyrlike 
expression 
it 
so 
often 
wore, 
as 
she
submitted 
herself 
to 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
and 
Lise. 
Both 
these 
women
quite 
sincerely 
tried 
to 
make 
her 
look 
pretty. 
She 
was 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/BO6oC2Dj6INZ.html">so</a> 
plain 
that
neither 
of 
them 
could<p>
think 
of 
her 
as 
a 
rival, 
so 
they 
began 
dressing
her 
with 
perfect 
sincerity, 
and 
with 
the 
naive 
and 
firm 
conviction
women 
have 
that 
dress 
can 
make 
a 
face 
pretty.

"No<p>
really, 
my 
dear, 
this 
dress 
is 
not 
pretty," 
said 
Lise, 
looking
sideways 
at 
Princess 
Mary 
from 
a 
little 
distance. 
"You 
have 
a 
maroon
dress, 
have 
it 
fetched. 
Really! 
You 
know 
the 
fate 
of 
your 
whole 
life 
may
be 
at 
stake. 
But 
this 
one 
is 
too 
light, 
it's 
not 
becoming!"

It 
was 
not 
the 
dress, 
but 
the 
face 
and 
whole 
figure 
of 
Princess 
Mary
that 
was 
not 
pretty, 
but 
neither 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
nor 
the 
little
princess 
felt 
this; 
they 
still 
thought 
that 
if 
a 
blue 
ribbon 
were 
placed
in 
the 
hair, 
the 
hair 
combed 
up, 
and 
the 
blue 
scarf 
arranged 
lower 
on
the 
best 
maroon 
dress, 
and 
so 
on, 
all 
would 
be 
well. 
They 
forgot 
that
the 
frightened 
face 
and 
the 
figure 
could 
not 
be 
altered, 
and 
that
however 
they 
might 
change 
the 
setting 
and 
adornment 
of 
that 
face, 
it
would 
still 
remain 
piteous 
and 
plain. 
After 
two 
or 
three 
changes 
to
which 
Princess 
Mary 
meekly 
submitted, 
just 
as 
her 
hair 
had 
been 
arranged
on 
the 
top<p>
of 
her 
head 
(a 
style 
that 
quite 
altered 
and 
spoiled 
<a href="/aVzUge/xr1N9P2.html">her
looks)</a> 
and 
she 
had 
put 
on 
a 
maroon 
dress 
with 
a 
pale-blue 
scarf, 
the
little 
princess 
walked 
twice 
round 
her, 
now 
adjusting 
a 
fold 
of 
the
dress 
with 
her 
little 
hand, 
now 
arranging 
the 
scarf 
and 
looking 
at 
her
with 
her 
head 
bent<p>
first 
on 
one 
side 
and 
then 
on 
the 
other.

"No, 
it 
will 
not 
do," 
she 
said 
decidedly, 
clasping 
her 
hands. 
"No,
Mary, 
really 
this 
dress 
does 
not 
suit 
you. 
I 
prefer 
you 
in 
your 
little
gray 
everyday 
dress. 
Now 
please, 
do 
it 
for<p>
my 
sake. 
Katie," 
she 
said
to 
the 
maid, 
"bring 
the 
princess 
her 
gray 
dress, 
and 
you'll 
see,
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
how 
I 
shall 
arrange 
it," 
she 
added, 
smiling
with 
a 
foretaste 
of 
artistic 
pleasure.

But 
when 
Katie 
brought 
the 
required 
dress, 
Princess 
Mary 
remained
sitting 
motionless 
before 
the 
glass, 
looking 
at 
her 
face, 
and 
saw 
in 
the
mirror 
her 
eyes 
full 
of 
tears 
and 
her 
mouth 
quivering, 
ready 
to 
burst
into 
sobs.

"Come, 
dear 
princess," 
said 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
"just 
one 
more
little 
effort."

The 
little 
princess, 
taking 
the 
dress 
from 
the 
maid, 
came 
up 
to 
Princess
Mary.

"Well, 
now 
we'll 
arrange 
something 
quite 
simple 
and 
becoming," 
she
said.

The 
three 
voices, 
hers, 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne's, 
and 
Katie's, 
who
was 
laughing 
at 
something, 
mingled 
in 
a 
merry 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jT2bI3yxat5tLBOA.html">sound,</a> 
like 
the 
chirping
of 
birds.

"No, 
leave 
me 
alone," 
said 
Princess 
Mary.

Her 
voice 
sounded 
so 
serious 
and 
so 
sad 
that 
the 
chirping 
of 
the 
birds
was 
silenced 
at 
once. 
They 
looked 
at 
the 
beautiful, 
large, 
thoughtful
eyes 
full 
of 
tears 
and 
of 
thoughts, 
gazing 
shiningly 
and 
imploringly 
at
them, 
and 
understood 
that<p>
it 
was 
useless 
and 
even 
cruel 
to 
insist.

"At 
least, 
change 
your 
coiffure," 
said 
the 
little 
princess.
"Didn't 
I 
tell 
you," 
she 
went 
on, 
turning 
reproachfully 
to
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
"Mary's 
is 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/uj2jbnI01f.html">a</a> 
face 
which 
such 
a 
coiffure 
does
not 
suit 
in 
the 
least. 
Not 
in 
the 
least! 
Please 
change<p>
it."

"Leave 
me 
alone, 
please 
leave 
me 
alone! 
It 
is 
all 
quite 
the 
same 
to
me," 
answered 
a 
voice 
struggling
