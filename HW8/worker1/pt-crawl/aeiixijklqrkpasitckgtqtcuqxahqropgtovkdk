at
the 
hunters 
who</h1>were 
arriving. 
The 
presence 
of 
Natasha-a 
woman, 
a
lady, 
and 
on 
horseback-raised 
the 
curiosity 
of 
the 
serfs 
to 
such 
a
degree 
that 
many 
<a href="/aVzUge/HPe8aKB76LQJK.html">of</a> 
them 
came 
up 
to 
her, 
stared 
her 
in 
the 
face, 
and
unabashed 
by 
her 
presence 
made 
remarks 
about 
her 
as 
though<p>
she 
were 
some
prodigy 
on 
show 
and 
not 
a 
human 
being 
able 
to 
hear 
or 
understand 
what
was 
said 
about 
her.

"Arinka! 
Look, 
she 
sits 
sideways! 
There 
she 
sits 
and 
her 
skirt
dangles.... 
See, 
she's 
got 
a 
little 
hunting 
horn!"

"Goodness 
gracious! 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZN11tHdfO4ZS.html">See</a> 
her 
knife?..."

"Isn't 
she 
a 
Tartar!"

"How 
is 
it 
you 
didn't 
go 
head 
over 
heels?" 
asked 
the 
boldest 
of
all, 
addressing 
Natasha 
directly.

"Uncle" 
dismounted 
at 
the 
porch 
of 
his 
little 
wooden 
house 
which
stood 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
an 
overgrown 
garden 
and, 
after 
a 
glance 
at 
his
retainers, 
shouted 
authoritatively 
that 
the 
superfluous 
ones 
should 
take
themselves 
off 
and 
that 
all 
necessary 
preparations 
should 
be 
made 
to
receive 
the 
guests 
and 
the 
visitors.

The 
serfs 
all 
dispersed. 
"Uncle" 
lifted 
Natasha 
off 
her 
horse 
and
taking 
her 
hand 
led 
her 
up 
the 
rickety 
wooden 
steps 
of 
the 
porch. 
The
house, 
with 
its 
bare, 
unplastered 
log 
walls, 
was 
not 
overclean-it
did 
not 
seem 
that 
those 
living 
in 
it 
aimed 
at 
keeping 
it 
spotless-but
neither 
was 
it 
noticeably 
neglected. 
In 
the 
entry 
there 
was 
a 
smell 
of
fresh 
apples, 
and 
wolf 
and 
fox 
skins 
hung 
about.

"Uncle" 
led 
the 
visitors 
through 
the 
anteroom 
into 
a 
small 
hall 
with
a 
folding 
table 
and 
red 
chairs, 
then 
into 
the 
drawing 
room 
with 
a 
round
birchwood 
table 
and 
a 
sofa, 
and 
finally 
into 
his 
private 
room 
where
there 
was 
a 
tattered 
sofa, 
a 
worn 
carpet, 
and 
portraits 
of 
Suvorov, 
of
the 
host's 
father 
and 
mother, 
and 
of 
himself 
in 
military 
uniform. 
The
study 
smelt 
strongly 
of 
tobacco 
and 
dogs. 
"Uncle" 
asked 
his 
visitors
to 
sit 
down 
and 
make 
themselves 
at 
home, 
and 
then 
went 
out 
of 
the 
room.
Rugay, 
his 
back 
still 
muddy, 
came 
into 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/yPp5Ro2N0Sdo.html">room</a> 
and 
lay 
down 
on 
the
sofa, 
cleaning 
himself 
with 
his 
tongue 
and 
teeth. 
Leading 
from 
the 
study
was 
a 
passage 
in 
which 
a 
partition 
with 
ragged 
curtains 
could 
be
seen. 
From 
behind 
this 
came 
women's 
laughter 
and 
whispers. 
Natasha,
Nicholas, 
and 
Petya 
took 
off 
their 
wraps 
and 
sat 
down 
on 
the 
sofa.
Petya, 
leaning 
on 
his 
elbow, 
fell 
asleep 
at 
once. 
Natasha 
and 
Nicholas
were 
silent. 
Their 
faces 
glowed, 
they 
were 
hungry 
and 
very 
cheerful.
They 
looked 
at 
one 
another 
(now 
that 
the 
hunt 
was 
over 
and 
they 
were 
in
the 
house, 
Nicholas 
no 
longer 
considered 
it 
necessary 
to 
show 
his 
manly
superiority 
over 
his 
sister), 
Natasha<p>
gave 
him<p>
a 
wink, 
and 
neither
refrained 
long 
from 
bursting 
into 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/uqv2NY3epgGc3jl.html">peal</a> 
of 
ringing 
laughter 
even 
before
they 
had 
a 
pretext 
ready 
to 
account 
for 
it.

After 
a 
while 
"Uncle" 
came 
in, 
in 
a 
Cossack 
coat, 
blue 
trousers, 
and
small 
top 
boots. 
And 
Natasha 
felt 
that 
this 
costume, 
the 
very 
one 
she
had 
regarded 
with 
surprise 
and 
amusement 
at 
Otradnoe, 
was 
just 
the
right 
thing 
and 
not 
at 
all 
worse 
than 
a 
swallow-tail<p>
or 
frock 
coat.
"Uncle" 
too 
was 
in 
high 
spirits 
and 
far 
from 
being 
offended 
by 
the
brother's 
and 
sister's 
laughter 
(it 
could 
never 
enter 
his 
head
