Their</h1>faces 
glowed, 
they 
were 
hungry 
and 
very 
cheerful.
They 
looked 
at 
one 
another 
(now 
that 
the 
hunt 
was 
over 
and 
they 
were 
in
the 
house, 
Nicholas 
no 
longer 
considered 
it 
necessary 
to 
show 
his 
manly
superiority 
over 
his 
sister), 
Natasha 
gave 
him 
a 
wink, 
and 
neither
refrained 
long 
from 
bursting 
into 
a 
peal 
of 
ringing 
laughter 
even 
before
they 
had 
a 
pretext 
ready 
to 
account 
for 
it.

After 
a 
while 
"Uncle" 
came 
in, 
in 
<a href="/aVzUge/qi4V4ieowf1.html">a</a> 
Cossack 
coat, 
blue 
trousers, 
and
small 
top 
boots. 
And 
Natasha 
<a href="/nocrawl/cZl/CiG4GFXfk5SN4ioN.html">felt</a> 
that 
this 
costume, 
the 
very 
one 
she
had 
regarded 
with 
surprise 
and 
amusement 
at 
Otradnoe, 
was 
just 
the
right 
thing 
and 
not 
at 
<a href="/aVzUge/kj1D1gi6dii.html">all</a> 
worse 
than 
a 
swallow-tail 
or 
frock 
coat.
"Uncle" 
too 
was 
in 
high 
spirits 
and 
far 
from 
being 
offended 
by 
the
brother's 
and 
sister's 
laughter 
(it 
could 
never 
enter 
his 
head 
that
they 
might 
be 
laughing 
at 
his 
way 
of 
life) 
he 
himself 
joined 
in 
the
merriment.

"That's 
right, 
young 
countess, 
that's 
it, 
come 
on! 
I 
never 
saw
anyone 
like 
her!" 
said 
he, 
offering 
Nicholas 
a 
pipe 
with 
a 
long 
stem
and, 
with 
a 
practiced 
motion 
of 
three 
fingers, 
taking 
down 
another 
that
had 
been<p>
cut 
short. 
"She's 
ridden 
all 
day 
like 
a 
man, 
and 
is 
as
fresh 
as 
ever!"

Soon 
after 
"Uncle's" 
reappearance 
the 
door 
was 
opened, 
evidently
from 
the 
sound 
by 
a 
barefooted 
girl, 
and 
a 
stout, 
rosy, 
good-looking
woman 
of 
about 
forty, 
with 
a 
double 
chin 
and 
full 
red 
lips, 
entered
carrying 
a 
large 
loaded 
tray. 
With 
hospitable 
dignity 
and 
cordiality 
in
her 
glance 
and 
in 
every 
motion, 
she 
looked 
at 
the 
visitors 
and, 
with
a 
pleasant 
smile, 
bowed 
respectfully. 
In 
spite 
of 
her 
exceptional
stoutness, 
which 
caused 
her 
to 
protrude 
her 
chest 
and 
stomach 
and 
throw
back 
her 
head, 
this 
woman 
(who 
was 
"Uncle's" 
housekeeper) 
trod
very 
lightly. 
She 
went 
to 
the 
table, 
set 
down 
the 
tray, 
and 
with<p>
her
plump 
white 
hands 
deftly 
took 
from 
it 
the 
bottles 
and 
various 
hors
d'oeuvres 
and 
dishes 
and 
arranged 
them 
on 
the 
table. 
When 
she 
had
finished, 
she 
stepped 
aside 
and 
stopped 
at 
the 
door 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/AXs4UJpiB1VEt9Im.html">with</a> 
a 
smile 
on 
her
face. 
"Here 
I 
am. 
I 
am 
she! 
Now 
do 
you 
understand 
'Uncle'?" 
her
expression 
said 
to 
Rostov. 
How 
could<p>
one 
help 
understanding? 
Not 
only
Nicholas, 
but 
even 
Natasha 
understood 
the 
meaning 
of 
his 
puckered 
brow
and 
the 
happy 
complacent 
smile 
that 
slightly 
puckered 
his 
lips 
when
Anisya 
Fedorovna 
entered. 
On 
the 
tray 
was 
a 
bottle 
of 
herb 
wine,
different 
kinds 
of 
vodka, 
<a href="/aVzUge/MLv29oRCc2bju.html">pickled</a> 
mushrooms, 
rye 
cakes 
made 
with
buttermilk,<p>
honey 
in 
the 
comb, 
still 
mead 
and 
sparkling 
mead, 
apples,
nuts 
(raw 
and 
roasted), 
and 
nut-and-honey 
sweets. 
Afterwards 
she 
brought
a 
freshly 
roasted 
chicken,<p>
ham, 
preserves 
made 
with 
honey, 
and 
preserves
made 
with 
sugar.

All 
this 
was 
the 
fruit 
of 
Anisya 
Fedorovna's 
housekeeping, 
gathered
and 
prepared 
by 
her. 
The 
smell 
and 
taste 
of 
it 
all 
had 
a 
smack
of 
Anisya 
Fedorovna<p>
herself: 
a<p>
savor 
of 
juiciness, 
cleanliness,
whiteness, 
and 
pleasant 
smiles.

"Take 
this, 
little 
Lady-Countess!" 
she 
kept 
saying,
