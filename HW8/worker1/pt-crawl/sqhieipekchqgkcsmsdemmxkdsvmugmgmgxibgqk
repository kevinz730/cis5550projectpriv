he 
continued, 
with</h1>a 
smile 
on 
his 
pale 
emaciated 
face
and 
a 
particularly 
happy 
light 
in 
his 
eyes, 
"you 
see, 
brother..."

Pierre 
had 
long 
been 
familiar 
with 
that 
story. 
Karataev 
had 
told 
it
to 
him 
alone 
some 
half-dozen 
times 
and 
always 
with 
a 
specially 
joyful
emotion. 
But 
well 
as 
he 
knew 
it, 
Pierre 
now 
listened 
to 
that 
tale 
as 
to
something 
new, 
and 
the 
quiet 
rapture 
Karataev 
evidently 
felt 
as 
he 
told
it 
communicated 
itself 
also 
to 
Pierre. 
The 
story 
was 
of 
an 
old 
merchant
who 
lived 
a 
good 
and 
God-fearing 
life 
with 
his 
family, 
and 
who 
went 
once
to 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/ce5sbb6XKBx4bKMVG.html">Nizhni</a> 
fair 
with 
a 
companion-a 
rich 
merchant.

Having 
put 
up 
at 
an 
inn 
they 
both 
went 
to 
sleep, 
and 
next 
morning 
his
companion 
was 
found 
robbed 
and 
with 
his 
throat 
cut. 
A 
bloodstained 
knife
was 
found 
under 
the 
old 
merchant's 
pillow. 
He 
was 
tried, 
knouted, 
and
his 
nostrils 
having 
been 
torn 
off, 
"all 
in 
due<p>
form" 
as 
Karataev 
put 
it,
he 
was 
sent 
to 
hard 
labor 
in 
Siberia.

"And<p>
so, 
brother"<p>
(it 
was 
at 
this 
point 
that 
Pierre 
came 
up), 
"ten 
years
or 
more 
passed 
by. 
The 
old 
man 
was 
living 
as 
a 
convict, 
submitting 
as
he 
should 
and 
doing 
no 
wrong. 
Only 
he 
prayed 
to 
God 
for 
death. 
Well, 
one
night 
the 
convicts 
were 
gathered 
just 
as 
we 
are, 
with 
the 
old 
man 
among
them. 
And 
they 
began 
telling 
what 
each 
was 
suffering 
for, 
and 
how 
they
had 
sinned 
against 
God. 
One 
told 
how 
he 
had 
taken 
a 
life, 
<a href="/cZl/uqv6Nqwe39OgAj.html">another</a> 
had
taken 
<a href="/aVzUge/JB3oqw19kK.html">two,</a> 
a 
third 
had 
set 
a 
house 
on 
fire, 
while 
another 
had 
simply
been 
a 
vagrant 
and 
had 
done 
nothing. 
So 
they 
asked 
the 
old 
man: 
'What
are 
you 
being 
punished 
for, 
Daddy?'-'I, 
my 
dear 
brothers,' 
said 
he, 
'am
being 
punished 
for 
my 
own 
and 
other 
men's 
sins. 
But 
I 
have 
not 
killed
anyone 
or 
taken 
anything 
that 
was 
not 
mine, 
but 
have 
only 
helped 
my
poorer 
brothers. 
I 
was 
a 
merchant, 
my 
dear 
brothers, 
<a href="/aVzUge/oe7jbnI0ct8.html">and</a> 
had 
much
property. 
'And 
he 
went 
on 
to 
tell 
them 
all 
about 
it 
in 
due 
order. 
'I
don't 
grieve 
for 
myself,' 
he 
says, 
'God, 
it 
seems, 
has 
chastened 
me.
Only 
I 
am 
sorry 
for 
my 
old 
wife 
and 
the 
children,' 
and 
the 
old 
man 
began
to 
weep. 
Now 
it 
happened 
that 
in 
the 
group 
was 
the 
very 
man 
who 
had
killed 
the 
other 
merchant. 
'Where 
did 
it 
happen, 
Daddy?' 
he 
said. 
'When,
and 
in 
what 
month?' 
He 
asked
