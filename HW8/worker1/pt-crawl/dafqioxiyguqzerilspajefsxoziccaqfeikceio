your</h1>serfs. 
If
they 
are 
beaten, 
flogged, 
or 
sent 
to 
Siberia, 
I 
don't 
suppose 
they 
are
any 
the 
worse 
off. 
In 
Siberia 
they 
lead 
the 
same 
animal 
life, 
and 
the
stripes 
on 
their 
bodies 
heal, 
and 
they 
are 
happy 
as 
before. 
But 
it 
is
a 
good 
thing 
for 
proprietors<p>
who 
perish 
morally, 
bring 
remorse 
upon
themselves, 
stifle 
this 
remorse 
and 
grow 
callous, 
as 
a 
result 
of 
being
able 
to 
inflict 
punishments 
justly 
and 
unjustly. 
It 
is 
those 
people 
I
pity, 
and 
for 
their 
sake 
I 
should 
like 
to 
liberate 
the 
serfs. 
You
may 
not 
have 
seen, 
but 
I 
have 
seen, 
how 
good 
men 
brought 
up 
in 
those
traditions 
of 
unlimited 
power, 
in 
time 
when 
they 
grow 
more 
irritable,
become 
cruel 
and 
harsh, 
are 
conscious 
of 
it, 
but 
cannot 
restrain
themselves 
and 
grow 
more 
and 
more 
miserable."

Prince 
Andrew 
spoke 
so 
earnestly 
that 
Pierre 
could 
not 
help 
thinking
that 
these 
thoughts 
had 
been 
suggested 
to 
Prince 
Andrew 
by 
his
father's 
case.

He 
did 
not 
reply.

"So 
that's 
what 
I'm 
sorry 
for-human<p>
dignity, 
peace 
of 
mind,
purity, 
and 
not 
the 
serfs' 
backs 
and 
foreheads, 
which, 
beat 
and 
shave
as 
you 
may, 
always 
remain 
the 
same 
backs 
and 
foreheads."

"No, 
no! 
A 
thousand 
times 
no! 
I 
shall 
never 
agree 
with 
you," 
said
Pierre.





CHAPTER 
XII

In 
the 
evening 
Andrew 
and 
Pierre 
got 
into 
the 
open 
carriage 
and 
drove 
to
Bald 
Hills. 
Prince 
Andrew, 
glancing 
at 
Pierre, 
broke 
the 
silence 
now 
and
then 
with 
remarks 
which 
showed 
that 
he 
was 
in 
a 
good 
temper.

Pointing 
to 
the 
fields, 
he 
spoke 
of 
the 
improvements 
he 
was 
making 
in
his 
husbandry.

Pierre 
remained 
gloomily 
silent, 
answering 
in 
monosyllables 
and
apparently 
immersed 
in 
his 
own 
thoughts.

He 
was 
thinking 
that 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
unhappy, 
had 
gone 
astray, 
did 
not
see 
the 
true 
light, 
and 
that 
he, 
Pierre, 
ought 
to 
aid, 
enlighten, 
and
raise 
him. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
thought 
of 
what 
he 
should 
say, 
he 
felt 
that
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
one 
word, 
one 
argument, 
would 
upset 
all 
his 
teaching,
and 
he 
shrank 
from 
beginning, 
afraid 
of 
exposing 
to 
possible 
ridicule
what 
to 
him 
was 
precious 
and 
sacred.

"No, 
but 
why 
do 
you 
think 
so?" 
Pierre 
suddenly 
began, 
lowering 
his
head 
and 
looking 
like 
a 
bull 
about<p>
to 
charge, 
"why 
do 
you 
think 
so?
You 
should 
not 
think 
so."

"Think? 
What 
about?" 
asked 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
surprise.

"About 
life, 
about 
man's 
destiny. 
It 
can't 
be 
so. 
I 
myself 
thought
like 
that, 
and 
do 
you 
know 
what 
saved 
me? 
Freemasonry! 
No, 
don't
smile. 
Freemasonry 
is 
not 
a 
religious 
ceremonial 
sect, 
as 
I 
thought
it 
was: 
Freemasonry 
is 
the 
best 
expression 
of 
the 
best, 
the 
eternal,
aspects 
of 
humanity."

And 
he 
began 
to 
explain 
Freemasonry 
as 
he 
understood 
it 
to 
Prince
Andrew. 
He 
said 
that 
Freemasonry 
is 
the 
teaching 
of 
Christianity 
freed
from 
the 
bonds 
of 
State 
and 
Church, 
a 
teaching 
of 
equality, 
brotherhood,
and 
love.

"Only 
our 
holy 
brotherhood 
has 
the 
real 
meaning 
of 
life, 
all 
the 
rest
is 
a 
dream," 
said 
Pierre. 
"Understand, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
that 
outside
this 
union 
all 
is 
filled 
with 
deceit 
and 
falsehood 
and 
I 
agree 
with 
you
that 
nothing 
is 
left 
for 
an 
intelligent 
and 
good 
man 
but 
to 
live 
out
his 
life, 
like 
you, 
merely 
trying 
not 
to 
harm 
others. 
But 
make 
our
fundamental 
convictions 
your 
own, 
join 
our 
brotherhood, 
give 
yourself 
up
to 
us, 
let 
yourself 
be 
guided, 
and 
you 
will 
at 
once 
feel 
yourself, 
as 
I
have 
felt 
myself, 
a 
part 
of 
that 
vast 
invisible 
chain 
the 
beginning 
of
which 
is<p>
hidden 
in 
heaven," 
said 
Pierre.

Andrew,
