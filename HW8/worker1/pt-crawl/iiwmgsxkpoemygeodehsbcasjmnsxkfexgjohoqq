it 
found 
itself</h1>in 
a 
position 
in 
which
any<p>
town 
built 
of 
wood 
was 
bound 
to 
burn, 
quite 
apart 
from 
whether 
it
had, 
or 
had 
not, 
a 
hundred 
and 
thirty 
inferior 
fire 
engines. 
Deserted
Moscow 
had 
to 
burn 
as 
inevitably 
as 
a 
heap 
of 
shavings 
has 
to 
burn 
on
which 
sparks 
continually 
fall 
for 
several 
days. 
A 
town 
built 
of 
wood,
where 
scarcely 
a 
day 
passes 
without 
conflagrations 
when 
the 
house 
owners
are 
in 
residence 
and 
a 
police 
force 
is 
present, 
cannot 
help 
burning 
when
its 
inhabitants 
have 
left 
it 
and 
it 
is 
occupied 
by 
soldiers 
who 
smoke
pipes, 
make 
campfires 
of 
the 
Senate 
chairs 
in 
the 
Senate 
Square, 
and
cook 
themselves 
meals 
twice 
a 
day. 
In 
peacetime<p>
it 
is 
only 
necessary 
to
billet 
troops 
in 
the 
villages 
of 
any 
district 
and 
the 
number 
of 
fires 
in
that 
district 
immediately 
increases. 
How 
much 
then 
must 
the 
probability
of 
fire 
be 
increased 
in 
an 
abandoned, 
wooden 
town 
where 
foreign 
troops
are 
quartered. 
"Le 
patriotisme 
feroce 
de 
Rostopchine" 
and 
the 
barbarity
of 
the 
French 
were 
not 
to 
blame 
in 
the 
matter. 
Moscow 
was 
set 
on 
fire 
by
the 
soldiers' 
pipes, 
kitchens, 
and 
campfires, 
and<p>
by 
the 
carelessness 
of
enemy 
soldiers 
occupying 
houses 
they 
did 
not 
own. 
Even 
if 
there 
was 
any
arson 
(which 
is 
very 
doubtful, 
for 
no 
one 
had 
any 
reason 
to 
burn 
the
houses-in 
any<p>
case 
a 
troublesome 
and 
dangerous 
thing 
to 
do), 
arson
cannot 
be 
regarded 
as 
the 
cause, 
for 
the 
same 
thing 
would 
have 
happened
without 
any 
incendiarism.
