admitting 
the 
ultimate 
purpose 
to 
be 
beyond 
our
ken, 
may 
we 
discern 
the 
sequence 
of 
experiences 
in 
the 
lives 
of
historic 
characters 
and 
perceive 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
effect 
they 
produce
(incommensurable 
with 
ordinary 
human 
capabilities), 
and 
then 
the 
words
chance 
and 
genius 
become 
superfluous.

We 
need 
only 
confess 
that 
we 
do 
not 
know 
the 
purpose<p>
of 
the 
European
convulsions 
and 
that 
we 
know 
only 
the 
facts-that 
is, 
the 
murders, 
first
in 
France, 
then 
in 
Italy, 
in 
Africa, 
in 
Prussia, 
in 
Austria, 
in 
Spain,
and 
in 
Russia-and 
that 
the 
movements 
from 
the 
west 
to 
the 
east 
and 
from
the 
east 
to 
the 
west 
form 
the 
essence 
and 
purpose 
of 
these 
events, 
and
not 
only 
shall 
we 
have 
no 
need 
to 
see 
exceptional 
ability 
and 
genius 
in
Napoleon 
and 
Alexander, 
but 
we 
shall 
be 
unable 
to 
consider 
them 
to
be 
anything 
but 
like 
other 
men, 
and 
we 
shall 
not 
be 
obliged 
to 
have
recourse 
to 
chance 
for 
an 
explanation 
of 
those 
small 
events 
which 
made
these 
people 
what 
they 
were, 
but 
it 
will 
be 
clear 
that 
all 
those 
small
events 
were 
inevitable.

By 
discarding 
a 
claim 
to 
knowledge 
of 
the 
ultimate 
purpose, 
we 
shall
clearly 
perceive 
that 
just 
as 
one 
cannot 
imagine 
a 
blossom 
or 
seed 
for
any 
single 
plant 
better 
suited 
to 
it 
than 
those 
it 
produces, 
so 
it 
is
impossible 
to 
imagine 
any 
two 
people 
more 
completely 
adapted 
down 
to 
the
smallest 
detail 
for 
the 
purpose 
they 
had 
to 
fulfill, 
than 
Napoleon 
and
Alexander 
with 
all 
their 
antecedents.
