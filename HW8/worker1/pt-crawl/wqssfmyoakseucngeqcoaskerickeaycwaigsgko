said 
she.

"Believe 
me, 
Princess, 
I 
am 
ready 
to 
do 
all 
I 
<a href="/cZl/ky4tiRgR5PvrsB0.html">can,"</a> 
answered 
<a href="/aVzUge/vx1R08LZ.html">Prince
Vasili,</a> 
"but 
it 
is 
difficult 
for 
me 
to 
ask 
the 
Emperor. 
I 
should
advise 
you 
to 
appeal 
to 
Rumyantsev 
through 
Prince 
Golitsyn. 
That 
would
be 
the 
best 
way."

The 
elderly 
lady 
was 
a 
Princess 
Drubetskaya, 
belonging 
to 
one 
of 
the
best 
families 
in 
Russia, 
but 
she 
was 
poor, 
and 
having 
long 
been 
out 
of
society 
had 
lost 
her 
former 
influential 
connections. 
She 
had 
now 
come 
to
Petersburg 
to 
procure 
an 
appointment 
in 
the 
Guards 
for 
her 
only 
son.
It 
was, 
in 
fact, 
solely 
to 
meet 
Prince 
Vasili 
that 
she 
had 
obtained 
<a href="/cZl/Mm2As8hK9M.html">an
invitation</a> 
to 
Anna 
Pavlovna's 
reception
