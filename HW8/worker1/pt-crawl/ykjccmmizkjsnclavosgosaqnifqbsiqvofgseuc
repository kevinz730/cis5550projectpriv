CHAPTER 
XXII

While 
these 
conversations 
were 
going 
on 
in 
the 
reception 
room 
and 
the
princess' 
room, 
a 
carriage 
containing 
Pierre 
(who 
had 
been 
sent 
for)
and 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
(who 
found 
it 
necessary 
to 
accompany 
him) 
was
driving 
into 
the 
court 
of 
Count 
Bezukhov's 
house. 
As 
the 
wheels
rolled 
softly 
over 
the 
straw 
beneath 
the 
windows, 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna,
having 
turned 
with 
words 
of 
comfort 
to 
her 
companion, 
realized 
that
he 
was 
asleep 
in 
his 
corner 
and 
woke 
him 
up. 
Rousing 
himself, 
Pierre
followed 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
out 
of 
the 
carriage, 
and 
only 
then 
began
to 
think 
of 
the 
interview 
with 
his 
dying 
father 
which 
awaited 
him. 
He
noticed 
that 
they 
had 
not 
come 
to 
the 
front 
entrance 
but 
to 
<a href="/aVzUge/hfW2t0f7UKBi.html">the</a> 
back
door. 
While 
he 
was 
getting 
down 
from 
the 
carriage 
steps 
two 
men, 
who
looked 
like 
tradespeople, 
ran 
hurriedly 
from 
the 
entrance 
and 
hid 
in 
the
shadow 
of 
the 
wall. 
Pausing 
for 
a 
moment, 
Pierre 
noticed 
several 
other
men 
of 
the 
same 
kind 
hiding 
in 
the 
shadow 
of 
the 
house 
on 
both 
sides.
But 
neither 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
nor 
the 
footman 
nor 
the 
coachman, 
who
could 
not 
help 
seeing 
these 
people, 
took 
any 
notice 
of 
them. 
"It 
seems
to 
be 
all 
right," 
Pierre 
concluded, 
and 
followed 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/me60s7mrwmb.html">Anna</a> 
Mikhaylovna.
She 
hurriedly 
ascended 
the 
narrow 
dimly 
lit 
stone 
staircase, 
calling 
to
Pierre, 
who 
was 
lagging 
behind, 
to 
follow. 
Though 
he 
<a href="/cZl/hU7NY4DduKC0zvJ.html">did</a> 
not 
see 
why 
it
was 
necessary 
for 
him 
to 
go 
to 
the 
count 
at 
all, 
still 
less 
why 
he 
had
to 
go 
by 
the 
back 
stairs, 
yet 
judging 
by 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna's 
air
of 
assurance 
and 
haste, 
Pierre 
concluded 
that 
it 
was 
all 
absolutely
necessary. 
Halfway 
up 
the<p>
stairs 
they 
were 
almost 
knocked 
over 
by
some 
<a href="/aVzUge/mK9b97YIp.html">men</a> 
who, 
carrying 
pails, 
came 
running 
downstairs, 
their 
boots
clattering. 
These 
men 
pressed 
close 
to 
the 
wall 
to 
let 
Pierre 
and 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
pass 
and 
did 
not 
evince 
the 
least 
surprise 
at 
seeing 
them
there.

"Is 
this 
the 
way 
to 
the 
princesses' 
apartments?" 
asked 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
of 
one 
of 
them.

"Yes," 
replied 
a 
footman 
in 
a 
bold 
loud 
voice, 
as 
if 
anything 
were
now 
permissible; 
"the 
door 
to 
the 
left, 
ma'am."

"Perhaps 
the 
count 
did 
not 
ask 
<a href="/cZl/ml75ReoD3VEt.html">for</a> 
me," 
said 
Pierre 
when 
he 
reached
the 
landing. 
"I'd 
better 
go 
to 
my 
own 
room."

Anna 
Mikhaylovna<p>
paused 
and 
waited 
for 
him 
to 
come 
up.

"Ah, 
my 
friend!" 
she 
said, 
touching 
his 
arm 
as 
she 
had 
done 
her
son's 
when 
speaking 
to 
him 
that 
afternoon, 
"believe 
me 
I 
suffer 
no
less 
than 
you 
do, 
but 
be 
a 
man!"

"But 
really,<p>
hadn't 
I 
better 
go 
away?" 
he 
asked,<p>
looking 
kindly 
at
her 
over 
his 
spectacles.

"Ah, 
my 
dear 
friend! 
Forget 
the 
wrongs 
that 
may 
have 
been 
done 
you.
Think 
that 
he 
is 
your 
father 
... 
perhaps 
in 
the 
agony 
of 
death." 
She
sighed. 
"I 
have 
loved 
you 
like 
a 
son 
from 
the 
first. 
Trust 
yourself 
to
me, 
Pierre. 
I 
shall 
not 
forget 
your 
interests."

Pierre 
did 
not 
understand 
a 
word, 
but 
the 
conviction 
that 
all 
this 
had
to 
be 
grew 
stronger, 
and 
he 
meekly 
followed 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
who 
was
already 
opening 
a 
door.

This 
door 
led 
into 
a 
back 
anteroom. 
An 
old 
man, 
a 
servant 
of 
the
princesses, 
sat 
in 
a 
corner 
knitting 
a 
stocking. 
Pierre 
had 
never 
been
in 
this 
part 
of 
the 
house 
and 
did 
not 
even 
know 
of 
the 
existence 
of
these 
rooms.
