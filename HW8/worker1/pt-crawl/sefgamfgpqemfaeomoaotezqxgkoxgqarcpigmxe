cried 
Sonya,
bursting</h1>into 
tears.

"What 
do 
you 
mean? 
For 
God's 
sake... 
If 
you 
tell, 
you 
are 
my
enemy!" 
declared 
Natasha. 
"You 
want 
me 
to 
be 
miserable, 
you 
want 
us
to 
be 
separated...."

When 
she 
saw 
Natasha's 
fright, 
Sonya 
shed 
tears 
of 
shame 
and 
pity
for 
her 
friend.

"But 
what 
has 
happened 
between 
you?" 
she 
asked. 
"What 
has 
he 
said
to 
you? 
Why 
<a href="/aVzUge/XB1ddue81ujvI.html">doesn't</a> 
he 
come 
to 
the 
house?"

Natasha 
did 
not 
answer 
her 
questions.

"For 
God's 
sake, 
Sonya, 
don't 
tell 
anyone, 
don't<p>
torture
me," 
Natasha 
entreated. 
"Remember 
no 
one 
ought 
to 
interfere 
in 
such
matters! 
I 
have 
confided 
in<p>
you...."

"But 
why 
this 
<a href="/aVzUge/ii8pbE9Xs9dZEO.html">secrecy?</a> 
Why 
doesn't 
he<p>
come 
to 
the 
house?" 
asked
Sonya. 
"Why 
doesn't 
he 
openly 
ask 
for 
your 
hand? 
You 
know 
Prince
Andrew 
gave 
you 
complete 
freedom-if 
it 
is 
really 
so; 
but 
I 
don't
believe 
it! 
Natasha, 
have 
you 
considered 
what 
these 
secret 
reasons 
can
be?"

Natasha 
looked 
at 
Sonya 
with 
astonishment. 
Evidently 
this 
question
presented 
itself 
to 
her 
mind 
for 
the 
first 
time 
and 
she 
did 
not 
know 
how
to 
answer 
it.

"I 
don't 
know 
what 
the 
reasons 
are. 
But 
there 
must 
be 
reasons!"

Sonya 
sighed 
and 
shook 
her 
head 
incredulously.

"If 
there 
were 
reasons..." 
she 
began.

But 
Natasha, 
guessing 
her 
doubts, 
interrupted 
her 
in 
alarm.

"Sonya, 
one 
can't 
doubt 
him! 
One 
can't, 
one 
can't! 
Don't 
you
understand?" 
she 
cried.

"Does 
he 
love 
you?"

"Does 
he 
love 
me?" 
Natasha 
repeated 
with 
a 
smile 
of 
pity 
at 
her
friend's 
lack 
of 
comprehension. 
"Why, 
you 
have 
read 
his 
letter<p>
and
you 
have 
seen 
him."

"But 
if 
he 
is 
dishonorable?"

"He! 
dishonorable? 
If 
you 
only 
knew!" 
exclaimed 
Natasha.

"If 
he 
is 
an 
honorable 
man 
he 
should 
either 
declare 
his 
intentions 
or
cease 
seeing 
you; 
and 
if 
you 
won't 
do 
this, 
I 
will. 
I 
will 
write 
to
him, 
and 
I 
will 
tell 
Papa!" 
said 
Sonya 
resolutely.

"But 
I 
can't 
live 
without 
him!" 
cried 
Natasha.

"Natasha, 
I 
don't 
understand 
you. 
And 
what 
are 
you 
saying! 
Think 
of
your 
father 
and 
of 
Nicholas."

"I 
don't 
want 
anyone, 
I 
don't 
love 
anyone 
but<p>
him. 
How 
dare 
you
say 
he 
is 
dishonorable? 
Don't 
you 
know 
that 
I 
love 
him?" 
screamed
Natasha. 
"Go 
away, 
Sonya! 
I 
don't 
want 
to 
quarrel 
with 
you, 
but
go, 
for 
God's 
sake 
go! 
You 
see 
how 
I 
am 
suffering!" 
Natasha 
cried
angrily, 
in 
a 
voice 
of 
despair 
and 
repressed 
irritation. 
Sonya 
burst
into 
sobs 
and 
ran 
from 
the 
room.

Natasha 
went 
to 
the 
table 
and 
without 
a 
moment's 
reflection 
wrote
that 
answer 
to 
Princess 
Mary 
which 
she 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
write 
all
the 
morning. 
In 
this 
letter 
she 
said 
briefly 
that 
all 
their
misunderstandings 
were 
at 
an 
end; 
that 
availing 
herself 
of 
the
magnanimity 
of 
Prince 
Andrew 
who 
when 
he 
went 
abroad 
had 
given 
her 
her
freedom, 
she 
begged 
Princess 
Mary 
to 
forget 
everything 
and 
forgive 
her
if 
she 
had 
been 
to 
blame 
toward 
her, 
but 
that 
she 
could 
not 
be 
his
wife. 
At 
that 
moment 
this 
all 
seemed 
quite 
easy, 
simple, 
and 
clear 
to
Natasha.


On 
Friday 
the 
Rostovs 
were 
to 
return 
to 
the 
country, 
but 
on 
Wednesday
the 
count 
went 
with 
the 
prospective 
purchaser 
to 
his 
estate 
near 
Moscow.

On 
the 
day 
the 
count 
left, 
Sonya 
and<p>
Natasha 
were 
invited 
to 
a 
big
dinner 
party 
at 
the 
Karagins', 
and 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
took 
them
there. 
At 
that 
party 
Natasha 
again 
met 
Anatole, 
and 
Sonya 
noticed
that 
she
