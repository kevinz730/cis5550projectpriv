(States-General)-evoked 
in 
him 
a 
whole
series 
of 
ideas 
he 
had 
long 
laid 
aside 
but 
which 
were 
deeply 
graven 
in
his 
soul: 
thoughts 
of 
the 
Contrat 
Social 
and 
the 
French 
Revolution. 
The
words 
that 
had 
struck 
him 
in 
the 
Emperor's 
appeal-that 
the 
sovereign 
was
coming 
to 
the 
capital 
for 
consultation 
with 
his 
people-strengthened 
this
idea. 
And 
imagining 
that 
in 
this 
direction 
something 
important 
which
he 
had 
long 
awaited<p>
was 
drawing 
near, 
he 
strolled 
about 
watching 
and
listening<p>
to 
conversations, 
but 
nowhere 
finding 
any 
confirmation 
of 
the
ideas 
that 
occupied 
him.

The 
Emperor's 
manifesto 
was 
read, 
evoking 
enthusiasm, 
and 
then 
all 
moved
about 
discussing 
it. 
Besides 
the 
ordinary 
topics 
of 
conversation, 
Pierre
heard 
questions<p>
of 
where 
the 
marshals 
of<p>
the 
nobility 
were 
to 
stand 
when
the 
Emperor 
entered, 
when 
a 
ball 
should 
be 
given 
in 
the 
Emperor's
honor, 
whether 
they 
should 
group 
themselves 
by 
districts 
or 
by 
whole
provinces... 
and 
so 
on; 
but 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
war 
was 
touched 
on, 
or
what 
the 
nobility 
had 
been 
convened 
for, 
the 
talk 
became 
undecided 
and
indefinite. 
Then 
all 
preferred 
listening 
to 
speaking.

A 
middle-aged 
<a href="/cZl/bdn3ddue9Y7Xiis.html">man,</a> 
handsome 
and 
virile, 
in 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oh2to5lFuWA.html">uniform</a> 
of 
a 
retired
naval 
officer, 
was 
speaking 
in 
<a href="/cZl/omA43bOIDr7tjjJI.html">one</a> 
of 
the 
rooms, 
and 
a 
small 
crowd 
was
pressing 
round 
him. 
Pierre 
went 
up 
to 
the 
circle 
that 
had 
formed 
round
the 
speaker 
and 
listened. 
Count 
Ilya 
Rostov, 
in 
a 
military 
uniform 
of
Catherine's 
time, 
was 
sauntering 
with 
a 
pleasant 
smile 
among 
the 
crowd,
with 
all 
of 
whom 
he 
was 
acquainted. 
He 
too 
approached 
that 
group 
and
listened 
with 
a 
kindly 
smile 
and 
nods 
of 
approval, 
as 
he 
always 
did,
to 
what 
the 
speaker 
was 
saying. 
The 
retired 
naval 
man 
was 
speaking 
very
boldly, 
as 
was 
evident 
from 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hoZ8Ujvc9t6WC.html">the</a> 
expression 
on 
the 
faces 
of 
the 
listeners
and 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
some 
people 
Pierre 
knew 
as 
the 
meekest 
and
quietest 
of 
men

away
