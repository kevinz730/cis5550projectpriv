when

all
that 
humanity 
calls

the 
historians 
produce 
a 
saving
conception

"greatness." 
"Greatness," 
it 
seems, 
excludes 
the 
standards

For 
the 
"great"

nothing

there 
is 
no

a

"C'est

say 
the

and 
there 
no 
longer 
exists 
either
good 
or 
evil 
but 
only 
"grand" 
and 
"not 
grand." 
Grand 
is 
good, 
not
grand 
is 
bad. 
Grand 
is 
the 
characteristic, 
in 
their 
conception, 
of 
some
special 
animals 
called 
"heroes." 
And 
Napoleon, 
escaping 
home 
in 
a 
warm
fur 
coat 
and 
leaving 
to 
perish 
those 
who 
were 
not 
merely 
his 
comrades
but 
were 
(in 
his 
opinion) 
men 
he 
had 
brought 
there, 
feels

something

himself)

* 
said 
he. 
And 
the 
whole 
world 
for 
fifty 
years 
has 
been
repeating: 
"Sublime! 
Grand!

"From

it

that 
to 
admit 
a 
greatness 
not 
commensurable 
with
the 
standard

is<p>
merely 
to 
admit 
one's 
own 
nothingness

immeasurable 
meanness.

For 
us 
with 
the 
standard 
of 
good 
and 
evil<p>
given 
us 
by 
Christ, 
no 
human
actions

there

CHAPTER 
XIX

What 
Russian, 
reading 
the 
account 
of 
the 
last 
part 
of 
the 
campaign
of 
1812, 
has 
not 
experienced 
an 
uncomfortable 
<a href="/cZl/Sj2GLY4PdQ.html">feeling</a> 
of 
regret,
dissatisfaction, 
and 
perplexity? 
Who 
has 
not 
asked 
himself 
how 
it 
is
that 
the 
French 
were 
not 
all 
captured 
or 
destroyed 
when 
our 
three 
armies
surrounded 
<a href="/aVzUge/PN38Yg1sbb.html">them</a> 
in 
superior 
numbers, 
when 
the 
disordered 
French, 
hungry
and 
freezing, 
surrendered 
in 
crowds, 
and 
when 
(as 
the 
historians 
relate)
the 
aim 
of 
the 
Russians 
was 
to 
stop 
the 
French, 
to 
cut 
them 
off, 
and
capture 
them 
all?

How 
was 
it 
that 
the 
Russian 
army, 
which 
when 
numerically 
weaker 
than 
the
French 
had 
given 
battle 
at 
Borodino, 
did 
not 
achieve 
its 
purpose 
when 
it
had 
surrounded 
the 
French 
on 
three 
sides 
and 
when 
its 
aim 
was 
to 
capture
them? 
Can 
the 
French 
be 
so 
enormously 
superior 
to 
us 
that 
when 
we 
had
surrounded 
them 
with 
superior 
forces 
we 
could 
not 
beat 
them? 
How 
could
that 
happen?

History 
<a href="/aVzUge/SvD6UQ4ReoD7Y.html">(or</a> 
what 
is 
called 
by 
that 
name) 
replying 
to 
these 
questions
says 
that 
this 
occurred 
because 
Kutuzov 
and 
Tormasov 
and 
Chichagov, 
and
this 
man 
and 
that 
man,<p>
did 
not 
execute 
such 
and 
such 
maneuvers....

But 
why 
did 
they 
not 
execute 
those 
maneuvers? 
And 
why 
if 
they 
were
guilty 
of 
not 
carrying 
out 
a 
prearranged 
plan 
were 
they 
not 
tried 
and
punished? 
But 
even 
if 
we 
admitted 
that 
Kutuzov, 
Chichagov, 
and<p>
others
were 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
Russian 
failures, 
it 
is 
still 
incomprehensible
why, 
the 
position 
of 
the 
Russian 
army 
being 
what 
it 
was 
at 
Krasnoe 
and
at 
the 
Berezina 
(in 
both 
cases 
we 
had 
superior 
forces), 
<a href="/cZl/IE2S0T.html">the</a> 
French 
army
with 
its 
marshals, 
kings, 
and 
Emperor 
was 
not 
captured, 
if 
that 
was 
what
the 
Russians 
aimed 
at.

The 
explanation 
of 
this 
strange 
fact 
given<p>
by 
Russian 
military
historians 
(to 
the 
effect 
that 
Kutuzov 
hindered 
an 
attack) 
is 
unfounded,
for 
we 
know 
that 
he 
could 
not 
restrain 
the 
troops 
from 
attacking 
at
Vyazma 
and 
Tarutino.

Why 
was 
the 
Russian 
army-which 
with 
inferior 
forces 
had 
withstood 
the
enemy 
in 
full 
strength 
at 
Borodino-defeated 
at 
Krasnoe 
and 
the 
Berezina
by 
the 
disorganized<p>
crowds 
of 
the 
French 
when 
it 
was 
numerically
superior?
