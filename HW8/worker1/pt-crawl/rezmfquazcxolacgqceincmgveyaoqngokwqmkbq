anger</h1>at 
the 
stupid 
arrangements 
and 
at 
the
Germans.

The 
cause 
of 
the 
confusion 
was 
that 
while 
the 
Austrian 
cavalry 
was
moving 
toward 
our 
left 
flank, 
the 
higher 
command 
found 
that 
our 
center
was 
too 
far 
separated 
from 
our 
right 
flank 
and

cavalry 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Jy44nQqE.html">were</a> 
all
ordered 
to 
turn 
back 
to 
the 
right. 
Several 
thousand 
cavalry 
crossed 
in
front 
of 
<a href="/aVzUge/vx1R08LZ.html">the</a> 
infantry, 
who

Austrian 
guide 
and 
a
Russian 
general. 
The 
general 
shouted 
a 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ow92Npkec1tA.html">demand</a> 
that 
the 
cavalry 
should 
be
halted,
