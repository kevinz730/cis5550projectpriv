Andrew 
and 
Pierre 
drove 
up 
to 
the 
front
entrance 
of 
the 
house 
at 
Bald 
Hills. 
As 
they<p>
approached 
the 
house,
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
a 
smile 
drew 
Pierre's<p>
attention 
to 
a 
commotion
going 
on 
at 
the 
back 
porch. 
A 
woman, 
bent 
with 
age, 
with 
a 
wallet 
on 
her
back, 
and 
a 
short, 
long-haired, 
young 
man 
in 
a 
black 
garment 
had 
rushed
back 
to 
the 
gate 
on 
seeing 
the 
carriage 
driving 
up. 
Two 
women 
ran 
out
after 
them, 
and 
all 
four, 
looking 
round 
at 
the 
carriage, 
ran 
in 
dismay
up 
the 
steps 
of<p>
the 
back 
porch.

"Those 
are 
Mary's 
'God's 
folk,'" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew. 
"They
have 
mistaken 
us 
for 
my 
father. 
This 
is 
the 
one 
matter 
in 
which 
she
disobeys 
him. 
He 
orders 
these 
pilgrims 
to 
be 
driven 
away, 
but 
she
receives 
them."

"But 
what 
are 
'God's 
folk'?" 
asked 
Pierre.

Prince 
Andrew 
had 
no 
time 
to 
answer. 
The 
servants 
came 
out 
to 
meet 
them,
and 
he 
asked 
where 
the 
old 
prince 
was 
and 
whether 
he 
was 
expected 
back
soon.

The 
old 
prince 
had 
gone 
to 
the 
town 
and 
was 
expected 
back 
any 
minute.

Prince 
Andrew 
led 
Pierre 
to 
his 
own 
apartments, 
which 
were 
always 
kept
in 
perfect 
order 
and 
readiness 
<a href="/nocrawl/aVzUge/gK6iOfK0nZs2zWn.html">for</a> 
him 
in 
his 
father's 
house; 
he
himself 
went 
to 
the 
nursery.

"Let 
us 
go 
and 
see 
my 
sister," 
he 
said 
to 
Pierre 
when 
he 
returned.
"I 
have 
not 
found 
her 
yet, 
she 
is 
hiding 
now, 
sitting 
with 
her
'God's 
folk.' 
It 
will 
serve 
her 
right, 
she 
will 
be 
confused,<p>
but
you 
will 
see 
her 
'God's 
folk.' 
It's 
really
