that 
possessed

his
liberty 
nor 
his 
resolution 
to 
punish 
his 
wife.

"No 
one 
is 
right 
and 
no 
one 
is 
to 
blame; 
so 
she 
too 
is 
not 
to
blame," 
he 
thought.

If 
he 
did 
not 
at 
once 
give 
his 
consent 
to 
a 
reunion 
with 
his 
wife, 
it
was 
only 
because 
in 
his 
state 
of 
depression 
he 
did 
not 
feel 
able 
to 
take
any 
step. 
Had 
his 
wife 
come 
to 
him, 
he 
would 
not 
have 
turned 
her 
away.
Compared 
to 
what 
preoccupied 
him, 
was 
it 
not 
a 
matter 
of 
indifference
whether 
he 
lived 
with 
his 
wife 
or 
not?

Without 
replying 
either 
to 
his 
wife 
or 
his 
mother-in-law, 
Pierre 
late
one 
night 
prepared 
for 
a 
journey 
and 
started 
for 
Moscow 
to 
see 
Joseph
Alexeevich. 
This 
is 
what 
he 
noted<p>
in 
his 
diary:

Moscow, 
17th 
November

I 
have 
just 
returned 
from 
my 
benefactor, 
and 
hasten 
to 
write 
down 
<a href="/aVzUge/oC5mGGRm7vxtj7Qb.html">what</a> 
I
have 
experienced. 
Joseph 
Alexeevich 
is 
living 
poorly 
and 
has 
for 
three
years 
been 
suffering 
from 
a 
painful 
disease 
of 
the 
bladder. 
No 
one 
has
ever 
heard 
him 
utter 
a 
groan 
or 
a 
word 
of 
complaint. 
From 
morning 
till
late 
at 
night, 
except 
when 
he 
eats 
his 
very 
plain 
food, 
he 
is 
working
at 
science. 
He 
received 
me 
graciously 
and 
made 
me 
sit 
down 
on 
the 
bed
on 
which 
he 
lay. 
I 
made 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
Knights 
of 
the 
East 
and 
of
Jerusalem, 
and 
he 
responded 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
asking 
me 
with 
a 
mild
smile 
what 
I 
had 
learned 
and 
gained 
in 
the 
Prussian 
and 
Scottish 
lodges.
I 
told 
him 
everything 
as 
best 
I 
could, 
and 
told 
him 
what 
I 
had 
proposed
to 
our 
Petersburg 
lodge, 
of 
the 
bad 
reception 
I 
had 
encountered, 
and 
of
my 
rupture 
with 
the 
Brothers. 
Joseph 
Alexeevich, 
having 
remained 
silent
and 
thoughtful 
for 
a 
good<p>
while, 
told 
me 
his 
view 
of 
the 
matter, 
which
at 
once 
lit 
up 
for 
me 
my 
whole 
past 
and 
the 
future 
path 
I 
should 
follow.
He 
surprised 
me 
by 
asking 
whether 
I 
remembered 
the 
threefold 
aim 
of
the 
order: 
(1) 
The 
preservation 
and 
study 
of 
the 
mystery. 
(2) 
The
purification 
and 
reformation 
of 
oneself 
for 
its 
reception, 
and 
(3) 
The
improvement 
of 
the 
human 
race 
by 
striving 
for 
such 
purification. 
Which
is 
the 
principal 
aim 
of 
these 
three? 
Certainly 
self-reformation 
and
self-purification. 
Only 
to 
this 
aim 
can 
we 
always 
strive 
independently
of 
circumstances. 
But 
at 
the 
same 
time 
just 
this 
aim 
demands 
the
greatest 
efforts 
of 
us; 
and 
so, 
led 
astray 
by 
pride, 
losing 
sight 
of
this 
aim, 
we 
occupy 
ourselves 
either 
with 
the 
mystery 
which 
in 
our
impurity<p>
we 
are 
unworthy 
to 
receive, 
or 
seek 
<a href="/aVzUge/uqv2NY3epgGc3jl.html">the</a> 
reformation 
of
the 
human 
race 
while 
ourselves 
setting 
an 
example 
of 
baseness 
and
profligacy. 
Illuminism 
is 
not 
a 
pure 
doctrine, 
just 
because 
it 
is
attracted 
by 
social 
activity 
<a href="/aVzUge/JB3oqw19kK.html">and</a> 
puffed 
up 
by 
pride. 
On 
this 
ground
Joseph 
Alexeevich 
condemned 
my 
speech 
and 
my 
whole 
activity, 
and
