intervention</h1>in
the 
business 
of 
packing 
was 
received 
skeptically. 
Everybody 
expected
some 
prank 
from 
her 
and 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
obey 
her; 
but 
she 
resolutely
and 
passionately 
demanded 
obedience, 
grew 
angry 
and 
nearly 
cried 
because
they 
did 
not 
heed 
her, 
and 
at 
last 
succeeded 
in 
making 
them 
believe 
her.
Her 
first 
exploit, 
which 
cost 
her 
immense 
effort 
and 
established 
her
authority, 
was 
the 
packing 
of 
the 
carpets. 
The 
count 
had 
valuable
Gobelin 
tapestries 
and 
Persian 
carpets 
in 
the 
house. 
When 
Natasha 
set
to 
work 
two 
cases 
were 
standing 
open 
in 
the 
ballroom, 
one 
almost 
full
up 
with 
crockery, 
the 
other 
with 
carpets. 
There 
was 
also 
much 
china
standing 
on 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vu6WlHf7HBo5cU.html">the</a> 
tables, 
and 
still 
more 
was 
being 
brought 
in 
from 
the
storeroom. 
A 
third 
case 
was 
needed 
and 
servants 
had 
gone 
to 
fetch 
it.

"Sonya, 
wait 
a 
bit-we'll 
pack 
everything 
into 
these," 
said 
Natasha.

"You<p>
can't, 
Miss, 
we 
have 
tried 
to," 
said 
the 
butler's 
assistant.

"No, 
wait 
a 
minute, 
please."

And 
Natasha 
began 
rapidly<p>
taking 
out 
of 
the 
case 
dishes 
and 
plates
wrapped 
in 
paper.

"The 
dishes 
must 
go 
in 
here 
among 
the 
carpets," 
said 
she.

"Why, 
it's 
a 
mercy 
if 
we 
can 
get 
the 
carpets 
alone 
into 
three 
cases,"
said 
the 
butler's 
assistant.

"Oh, 
wait, 
please!" 
And 
Natasha 
began 
rapidly 
and 
deftly 
sorting 
out 
the
things. 
"These 
aren't 
needed," 
said 
she, 
putting 
aside 
some 
plates
of 
Kiev 
ware. 
"These-yes, 
these 
must 
go 
among 
the 
carpets," 
she 
said,
referring 
to 
the 
Saxony 
china 
dishes.

"Don't, 
Natasha! 
Leave 
it 
alone! 
We'll 
get 
it 
all<p>
packed," 
urged 
Sonya
reproachfully.

"What 
a 
young 
lady 
she 
is!" 
remarked 
the 
major-domo.

But 
Natasha 
would 
not 
give 
in. 
She 
turned 
everything 
out 
and 
began
quickly 
repacking, 
deciding 
that 
the 
inferior 
Russian 
carpets 
and
unnecessary 
crockery 
should 
not 
be 
taken 
at 
all. 
When 
everything 
had
been 
taken<p>
out 
of 
the 
cases, 
they 
recommenced 
packing, 
and 
it 
turned
out 
that 
when 
the 
cheaper 
things 
not<p>
worth 
taking 
had 
nearly 
all 
been
rejected, 
the 
valuable 
ones 
<a href="/cZl/EG8eplAZ2hai3.html">really</a> 
did<p>
all 
go<p>
into 
the 
two 
cases. 
Only
the<p>
lid 
of 
the 
case 
containing 
the<p>
carpets 
would 
not 
shut 
down. 
A 
few
more 
things 
might 
have 
been 
taken 
out, 
but 
Natasha 
insisted 
on 
having
her 
own 
<a href="/cZl/AX7CiG5ioN4DLq.html">way.</a> 
She 
packed, 
repacked, 
pressed, 
made 
the 
butler's 
assistant
and 
Petya-whom 
she 
had 
drawn 
into 
the 
business 
of 
packing-press 
on 
the
lid, 
and 
made 
desperate 
efforts 
herself.

"That's 
enough, 
Natasha," 
said 
Sonya. 
"I 
see 
you 
were 
right, 
but 
just
take 
out 
the 
top 
one."

"I 
won't!" 
cried 
Natasha, 
with 
one 
hand 
holding 
back 
the<p>
hair 
that 
hung
over 
her 
perspiring 
face, 
while 
with 
the 
other 
she 
pressed 
down 
the
carpets.<p>
"Now 
press, 
Petya! 
Press, 
Vasilich, 
press 
hard!" 
she 
cried.

The 
carpets 
yielded 
and 
the 
lid 
closed; 
Natasha, 
clapping 
her 
hands,
screamed 
with 
delight 
and 
tears 
fell 
from 
her 
eyes. 
But 
this 
only
lasted 
a 
moment. 
She 
at 
once 
set 
to 
work 
afresh 
and 
they 
now 
trusted 
her
completely. 
The 
count 
was 
not 
angry 
even 
when 
they 
told 
him 
that 
Natasha
had 
countermanded 
an 
order 
of 
his, 
and 
the 
servants 
now 
came 
to 
her
to 
ask 
whether 
a 
cart 
was 
sufficiently 
loaded, 
and 
whether 
it 
might
be 
corded 
up. 
Thanks 
to 
Natasha's 
directions 
the 
work 
now 
went 
on
expeditiously, 
unnecessary 
things 
were 
left, 
and 
the 
most 
valuable
packed 
as 
compactly 
as 
possible.

But 
hard 
as 
they 
all 
worked 
till 
quite 
late 
that 
night, 
they 
could 
not
get 
everything 
packed. 
The 
countess 
had 
fallen 
asleep 
and 
the 
count,
having 
put 
off 
their 
departure 
till 
next 
morning, 
went 
to 
bed.

Sonya 
and 
Natasha 
slept
