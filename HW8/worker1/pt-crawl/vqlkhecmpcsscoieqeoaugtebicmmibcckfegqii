bending 
forward
and</h1>hardly 
able 
to 
restrain 
his 
jerky 
movements, 
and 
from 
the 
way 
he
darted 
forward 
at 
every 
word 
or 
gesture 
of 
the 
commander 
in 
chief,
it 
was 
evident 
that 
he 
performed 
his 
duty 
as 
a 
subordinate 
with 
even
greater 
zeal 
than 
his 
duty 
as 
a 
commander. 
Thanks 
to 
the 
strictness 
and
assiduity<p>
of 
its 
commander 
the 
regiment, 
in 
comparison 
with 
others 
that
had 
reached 
Braunau 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
was 
in 
splendid 
condition. 
There
were 
only 
217 
sick 
and 
stragglers. 
Everything 
was 
in 
good 
order 
except
the 
boots.

Kutuzov 
walked 
through 
the 
ranks, 
sometimes 
stopping 
to 
say 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/OH80CyE7uR.html">few
friendly</a> 
words 
to 
officers 
he 
had 
known 
in 
the 
Turkish 
war, 
sometimes
also 
to 
the 
soldiers. 
Looking 
at 
their 
boots 
he 
several 
times 
shook 
his
head 
sadly, 
pointing 
them 
out 
to 
the 
Austrian 
general 
with 
an 
expression
which 
seemed 
to 
say 
that 
he 
was 
not 
blaming 
anyone, 
but 
could 
not 
help
noticing<p>
what 
a 
bad 
state 
of 
things 
it 
was. 
The 
regimental 
commander
ran 
forward 
on 
each 
such 
occasion, 
fearing 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Uc7hOZs5W6Mm.html">miss</a> 
a 
single 
word 
of 
the
commander 
in 
chief's 
regarding 
the 
regiment. 
Behind 
Kutuzov, 
at 
a
distance 
that 
allowed 
every 
softly 
spoken 
word 
to 
be 
heard, 
followed
some 
twenty 
men 
of 
his 
suite. 
These 
gentlemen 
talked 
among 
themselves
and 
sometimes 
laughed. 
Nearest 
of 
all 
to 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
walked
a 
handsome 
adjutant. 
This 
was 
Prince 
Bolkonski. 
Beside 
him 
was 
his
comrade 
Nesvitski, 
a 
tall 
staff 
officer, 
extremely 
stout, 
with 
a
kindly, 
smiling, 
handsome 
face 
and 
moist 
eyes. 
Nesvitski 
could 
hardly
keep 
from 
laughter 
provoked 
by 
a 
swarthy 
hussar 
officer 
who 
walked
beside 
him. 
This 
hussar, 
with 
a 
grave 
face 
and 
without 
a 
smile 
or 
a
change 
in 
the 
expression 
of 
his 
fixed 
eyes, 
watched 
the 
regimental
commander's 
back 
and 
mimicked 
his 
every 
movement. 
Each 
time 
the
commander 
started 
and 
bent 
forward, 
the 
hussar 
started 
and 
bent 
forward
in 
exactly 
the 
same 
manner. 
Nesvitski 
laughed 
and 
nudged 
the 
others 
to
make 
them 
look 
at 
the 
wag.

Kutuzov 
walked 
slowly 
and 
languidly 
past 
thousands 
of 
eyes 
which 
were
starting 
from 
their 
sockets 
to 
watch 
their 
chief. 
On 
reaching 
the
third 
company 
he 
suddenly 
stopped. 
His 
suite, 
not 
having 
expected 
this,
involuntarily 
came 
closer 
to 
him.

"Ah, 
Timokhin!" 
said 
he, 
recognizing 
the 
red-nosed 
captain 
who 
had
been 
reprimanded 
on 
account 
of 
the 
blue 
greatcoat.

One 
would 
have 
thought 
it 
impossible 
for 
a 
man 
to 
stretch 
himself
more 
than 
Timokhin 
had 
done 
when 
he 
was 
reprimanded 
by 
the 
regimental
commander, 
but 
now 
that 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
addressed 
him 
he 
drew
himself 
up 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
it 
seemed 
he 
could 
not 
have 
sustained
it 
had 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
continued 
<a href="/cZl/Op8sfA3YXnB2vZzpo.html">to</a> 
look 
at 
him, 
and 
so 
Kutuzov,
who 
evidently 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/qm8As2CMvYt8FlpJ.html">understood</a> 
his 
case 
and 
wished 
him 
nothing 
but 
good,
quickly 
turned 
away, 
a 
scarcely 
perceptible 
smile 
flitting 
over 
his
scarred 
and 
puffy 
face.

"Another 
Ismail 
comrade," 
said 
he. 
"A 
brave 
officer! 
Are 
you
satisfied 
with 
him?" 
he 
asked 
the 
regimental 
commander.

And 
the 
latter-unconscious 
that 
he 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ex5AyyZE1suDcq7kQqNG.html">was</a> 
being 
reflected 
in 
the 
hussar
officer
