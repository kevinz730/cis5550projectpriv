it 
proper 
in 
his 
quality</h1>of 
doctor 
de 
forcer 
la 
consigne, 
* 
as 
he 
told
Princess 
Mary, 
and 
went 
in 
to 
see 
the 
prince. 
It 
happened 
that 
on 
that
morning 
of 
his 
name 
day 
the 
prince 
was 
in 
one 
of 
his 
worst 
moods. 
He 
had
been 
going 
about 
the 
house 
all 
the 
morning 
finding 
fault 
with 
everyone
and 
pretending 
not 
to 
understand<p>
what 
was 
said 
to 
him 
and 
not 
to 
be
understood 
himself. 
Princess<p>
Mary 
well 
knew 
this 
mood 
of 
quiet 
absorbed
querulousness, 
which 
generally 
culminated 
in 
a 
burst 
of 
rage, 
and 
she
went 
about 
all 
that 
morning 
as 
though 
facing 
a 
cocked 
and 
loaded 
gun
and 
awaited 
the<p>
inevitable 
explosion. 
Until 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/NhF3gdRt8E.html">doctor's</a> 
arrival 
the
morning 
had 
passed 
off 
safely. 
After 
admitting<p>
the 
doctor, 
Princess 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/YE3m8rP8GH.html">Mary
sat</a> 
down 
with 
a 
book 
in 
the 
drawing 
room 
near 
the 
door 
through 
which 
she
could 
hear 
all 
that 
passed 
in 
the 
study.

 
 
 
 
* 
To 
force 
the 
guard.

At 
first 
she 
heard 
only 
Metivier's 
voice, 
then 
her 
father's, 
then
both 
voices 
began 
speaking 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
door 
was 
flung 
open,
and 
on 
the 
threshold 
appeared 
the 
handsome 
figure 
of 
the 
terrified
Metivier 
with 
his 
shock 
of 
black 
hair, 
and 
the 
prince 
in 
his 
dressing
gown 
and 
fez, 
his 
face 
distorted 
with 
fury 
and 
the 
pupils 
of 
his 
eyes
rolled 
downwards.

"You 
don't 
understand?" 
shouted 
the 
prince, 
"but 
I 
do! 
French
spy, 
slave 
of 
Buonaparte, 
spy, 
get 
out 
of 
my 
house! 
Be 
off, 
I 
tell
you..." 
and 
he 
slammed 
the 
door.

Metivier, 
shrugging 
his 
shoulders, 
went 
up 
to 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne
who 
at 
the 
sound 
of 
shouting 
had 
run 
in 
from 
an 
adjoining 
room.

"The 
prince 
is 
not 
very 
well: 
bile 
and 
rush 
of 
blood 
to 
the 
head. 
Keep
calm, 
I 
will 
call 
again 
tomorrow," 
said 
Metivier; 
and 
putting 
his
fingers 
to 
his 
lips 
he 
hastened 
away.

Through 
the 
study 
door 
came 
the 
sound 
of 
slippered 
feet 
and 
the 
cry:
"Spies, 
traitors, 
traitors 
everywhere! 
Not 
a 
moment's 
peace 
in 
my
own 
house!"

After 
Metivier's 
departure 
the 
old 
prince 
called 
his 
daughter 
in, 
and
the 
whole 
weight 
of 
his 
wrath 
fell 
on 
her. 
She 
was 
to 
blame 
that 
a 
spy
had 
been 
admitted. 
Had 
he 
not 
told 
her, 
yes, 
told 
her 
to 
make 
a 
list,
and 
not 
to 
admit 
anyone 
who 
was 
not 
on 
that 
list? 
Then 
why 
was 
that
scoundrel 
admitted? 
She 
was 
the 
cause 
of 
it 
all. 
With 
her, 
he 
said, 
he
could 
not 
have 
a 
moment's 
peace 
and 
could 
not 
die 
quietly.

"No, 
ma'am! 
We 
must 
part, 
we 
must 
part! 
Understand 
that, 
understand
it! 
I 
cannot 
endure 
any 
more," 
he 
said, 
and 
left 
the 
room. 
Then, 
as 
if
afraid 
she 
might 
find 
some 
means 
of 
consolation, 
he 
returned 
and 
trying
to 
appear 
calm 
added: 
"And 
don't 
imagine 
I 
have 
said 
this 
in 
a
moment 
of 
anger. 
I 
am 
calm. 
I 
have 
thought 
it 
over, 
and<p>
it 
will 
be
carried 
out-we 
must 
part; 
so 
find 
some 
place 
for 
yourself...." 
But
he 
could 
not 
restrain 
himself 
and 
with 
the 
virulence 
of 
which 
only 
one
who 
loves 
is 
capable, 
evidently 
suffering 
himself,<p>
he 
shook 
his 
fists 
at
her 
and 
screamed:

"If 
only 
some 
fool 
would 
marry 
her!" 
Then 
he 
slammed 
the 
door, 
sent
for 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
and 
subsided 
into 
his 
study.

At 
two 
o'clock 
the 
six 
chosen 
guests 
assembled 
for 
dinner.

These 
guests-the 
famous 
Count 
Rostopchin, 
Prince 
Lopukhin 
with 
his
nephew, 
General 
Chatrov 
an 
old 
war 
comrade 
of 
the 
prince's, 
and
of 
the 
younger 
generation 
Pierre<p>
and 
Boris 
Drubetskoy-awaited 
the
prince 
in 
the 
drawing 
room.

Boris,
