the 
profound
course 
of 
ideas 
which 
guided 
his 
decisions 
merely 
gave 
them 
<a href="/aVzUge/EY78hoZsa0.html">his</a> 
final
conclusions 
in 
the 
form 
of 
commands. 
Having 
listened 
to 
a 
suggestion
from 
Davout, 
who 
was 
now 
called 
Prince 
d'Eckmuehl, 
to 
turn 
the 
Russian
left 
wing, 
Napoleon 
said 
it 
should 
not 
be 
done, 
without 
explaining
why 
not. 
To 
a 
proposal 
made 
by 
General 
Campan 
(who 
was 
to 
attack 
<a href="/cZl/ml75ReoD3VEt.html">the
fleches)</a> 
to 
lead 
his 
division 
through 
the 
woods, 
Napoleon 
agreed, 
though
the 
so-called 
Duke 
of 
Elchingen 
(Ney) 
ventured 
to 
remark 
that 
a 
movement
through 
the 
woods 
was 
dangerous 
and 
might 
disorder 
the 
division.

Having 
inspected 
the 
country 
opposite 
the 
Shevardino 
Redoubt, 
Napoleon
pondered 
a 
little 
in 
silence 
and 
then 
indicated 
the 
spots 
where 
two
batteries 
should 
be 
set 
up 
by 
the 
morrow 
to 
act 
against 
the 
Russian
entrenchments, 
and 
the 
places 
where, 
in 
line 
with 
them, 
the 
field
artillery 
should 
be 
placed.

After 
giving 
these 
and 
other 
commands 
he 
returned 
to 
his 
tent, 
and 
the
dispositions 
for 
the 
battle 
<a href="/cZl/fn1QrO4LEWO6h.html">were</a> 
written 
down 
from 
his<p>
dictation.

These 
dispositions, 
of 
which 
the 
French 
historians 
write 
with 
enthusiasm
and 
other 
historians 
with 
profound 
respect, 
were 
as 
follows:

At 
dawn 
the 
two 
new 
batteries 
established 
during 
the 
night 
on 
<a href="/cZl/nHL70tvJE6nrOP.html">the
plain</a> 
occupied 
by 
the 
Prince 
d'Eckmuehl 
will 
open 
fire 
on 
the 
opposing
batteries 
of 
the 
enemy.

At 
the 
same 
<a href="/cZl/oJ2mSaQt5d6E.html">time</a> 
the 
commander 
of 
the 
artillery 
of 
the 
1st 
Corps,
General 
Pernetti, 
with 
thirty 
cannon 
of 
Campan's 
division 
and 
all 
the
howitzers 
of 
Dessaix's 
and 
Friant's 
divisions, 
will 
move 
forward, 
open
fire, 
and 
overwhelm 
with 
shellfire

enemy's 
battery,
