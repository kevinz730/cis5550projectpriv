tears 
gushed 
from 
her 
eyes, 
and 
she 
turned 
quickly 
to
hide 
them 
and 
left 
the 
room.

She 
passed 
into 
the 
sitting 
room, 
stood 
there 
thinking 
awhile, 
and 
then
went 
into 
the 
maids' 
room. 
There 
an 
old 
maidservant 
was 
grumbling 
at
a 
young 
girl 
who 
stood 
panting, 
having 
just 
run 
in 
through 
the 
cold 
from
the 
serfs' 
quarters.

"Stop 
playing-there's 
a 
time 
for 
everything," 
said 
the 
old
woman.

"Let 
her 
alone, 
Kondratevna," 
said 
Natasha. 
"Go, 
Mavrushka,
go."

Having 
released 
Mavrushka, 
Natasha 
crossed 
the 
dancing 
hall 
and 
went
to 
the 
vestibule. 
There 
an 
old 
footman 
and 
two 
young 
ones 
were 
playing
cards. 
They 
broke 
off 
and 
rose 
as 
she 
entered.

"What 
can 
I 
do 
with 
them?" 
thought 
Natasha.

"Oh, 
Nikita, 
please 
go... 
where 
can 
I 
send 
him?... 
Yes, 
go 
to 
the
yard 
and 
fetch 
a 
fowl, 
please, 
a 
cock, 
and 
you, 
Misha, 
bring 
me 
some
oats."

"Just 
a 
few 
oats?" 
said 
Misha, 
cheerfully 
and 
readily.

"Go, 
go 
quickly," 
the 
old 
man 
urged 
him.

"And 
you, 
Theodore, 
get 
me 
a 
piece 
of 
chalk."

On 
her 
way 
past 
the 
butler's 
pantry 
she 
told 
them 
to 
set 
a 
samovar,
though 
it 
was 
not 
at 
all 
the 
time 
for 
tea.

Foka, 
the 
butler, 
was 
the 
most 
ill-tempered 
person 
in 
the 
house.
Natasha 
liked 
to 
test 
her 
power 
over 
him. 
He 
distrusted 
the 
order 
and
asked 
whether 
the 
samovar 
was 
really 
wanted.

"Oh 
dear, 
what 
a 
young 
lady!" 
said 
Foka, 
pretending 
to 
frown 
at
Natasha.

No 
one 
in 
the 
house 
sent 
people 
about 
or 
gave 
them 
as 
much 
trouble 
as
Natasha 
did. 
She 
could 
not 
see 
people 
unconcernedly, 
but 
had 
to 
send
them 
on 
some 
errand. 
She 
seemed 
to 
be 
trying 
whether 
any 
of 
them 
would
get 
angry 
or 
sulky 
with 
her; 
but 
the 
serfs 
fulfilled 
no 
one's 
orders
so 
readily 
as 
they 
did 
hers. 
"What 
can 
I 
do, 
where 
can 
I 
go?"
thought 
she, 
as 
she 
went 
slowly 
along 
the 
passage.

"Nastasya 
Ivanovna, 
what 
sort 
of 
children 
shall 
I 
have?" 
she 
asked
the 
buffoon, 
who 
was 
coming 
toward 
her 
in 
a 
woman's<p>
jacket.

"Why, 
fleas, 
crickets, 
grasshoppers," 
answered 
the 
buffoon.

"O<p>
Lord, 
O 
Lord, 
it's 
always 
the 
same! 
Oh, 
where 
am 
I 
to 
go? 
What
am 
I 
to 
do 
with 
myself?" 
And 
tapping 
with 
her 
heels, 
she 
ran 
quickly
upstairs 
to 
see 
Vogel 
and 
his<p>
wife 
who 
lived 
on 
the 
upper 
story.

Two 
governesses 
were 
sitting 
with 
the 
Vogels 
at 
a 
table, 
on 
which<p>
were
plates 
of 
raisins, 
walnuts, 
and 
almonds. 
The 
governesses 
were 
discussing
whether 
it 
was 
cheaper 
to 
live 
in 
Moscow<p>
or 
Odessa. 
Natasha 
sat 
down,
listened 
to 
their 
talk 
with 
a 
serious 
and 
thoughtful 
air, 
and 
then 
got
up 
again.

"The 
island 
of 
Madagascar," 
she 
said, 
"Ma-da-gas-car," 
she
repeated, 
articulating 
each 
syllable 
distinctly, 
and, 
not 
replying 
to
Madame 
Schoss 
who 
asked 
her 
what 
she 
was 
saying, 
she 
went 
out 
of 
the
room.

Her 
brother 
Petya 
was 
upstairs 
too; 
with 
the 
man 
in 
attendance 
on 
him
he 
was 
preparing 
fireworks 
to 
let 
off 
that 
night.

"Petya! 
Petya!" 
she 
called 
to 
him. 
"Carry 
me 
downstairs."

Petya 
ran 
up 
and 
offered 
her 
his 
back. 
She 
jumped 
on 
it, 
putting 
her
arms 
round 
his 
neck,
