were</h1>both 
particularly 
happy 
and 
gay.
That 
evening, 
proud 
of 
Dolokhov's 
proposal, 
her 
refusal, 
and 
her
explanation 
with 
Nicholas, 
Sonya 
twirled 
about 
before 
she 
left 
home
so 
that 
the 
maid 
could 
hardly 
get 
her 
hair 
plaited, 
and<p>
she 
was
transparently 
radiant 
with 
impulsive 
joy.

Natasha 
no 
less 
proud 
of 
her 
first 
long 
dress 
and 
of 
being 
at 
a 
real
ball 
was 
even 
happier. 
They 
were 
both 
dressed 
in 
white 
muslin 
with 
pink
ribbons.

Natasha 
fell 
in<p>
love 
the 
very 
moment 
she 
entered 
the 
ballroom. 
She
was 
not 
in 
love 
with 
anyone 
in 
particular, 
but 
with 
everyone. 
Whatever
person 
she 
happened 
to 
look 
at 
she 
was 
in 
love 
with 
for 
that 
moment.

"Oh, 
how 
delightful 
it 
is!" 
she 
kept 
saying, 
running 
up 
to 
Sonya.

Nicholas 
and 
Denisov 
were 
walking 
up 
and 
down, 
looking 
with 
kindly
patronage 
at 
the 
dancers.

"How 
sweet 
she 
is-she 
will 
be 
a 
weal 
beauty!" 
said 
Denisov.

"Who?"

"Countess 
Natasha," 
answered 
Denisov.

"And 
how 
she 
dances! 
What 
gwace!" 
he 
said 
again 
after 
a 
pause.

"Who 
are 
you 
talking 
about?"

"About 
your 
sister," 
ejaculated 
Denisov 
testily.

Rostov 
smiled.

"My 
dear 
count, 
you 
were 
one 
of 
my 
best 
pupils-you 
must 
dance,"
said 
little 
Iogel 
coming 
up 
to 
Nicholas. 
"Look 
how 
many 
charming 
young
ladies-" 
He 
turned 
with 
the 
same 
request 
to 
Denisov 
who 
was 
also 
a
former 
pupil 
of 
his.

"No, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
I'll 
be 
a<p>
wallflower," 
said 
Denisov.
"Don't 
you 
wecollect 
what 
bad 
use 
I 
made 
of 
your 
lessons?"

"Oh 
no!" 
said 
Iogel, 
hastening 
to 
reassure 
him. 
"You 
were 
only
inattentive, 
but 
you 
had 
talent-oh 
yes, 
you 
had 
talent!"

The 
band 
struck 
up 
the 
newly 
introduced 
mazurka. 
Nicholas 
could 
not
refuse 
Iogel 
and 
asked 
Sonya 
to 
dance. 
Denisov 
sat 
down 
by 
the 
old
ladies 
and, 
leaning 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/pX5XZWkd6KpkPN5XZEHJ.html">on</a> 
his 
saber 
and 
beating 
time 
with 
his 
foot, 
told
them 
something 
funny 
and 
kept 
them 
amused, 
while 
he 
watched 
the 
young
people 
dancing, 
Iogel 
with 
Natasha, 
his 
pride 
and 
his 
best 
pupil, 
were
the 
first 
couple. 
Noiselessly, 
skillfully 
stepping 
with 
his 
little
feet 
in 
low 
shoes, 
Iogel 
flew 
first 
across 
the 
hall 
with 
Natasha, 
who,
though 
shy, 
went 
on 
carefully 
executing 
her 
steps. 
Denisov 
did 
not
take 
his 
eyes 
off 
her 
and 
beat 
time 
with 
his 
saber 
in 
a 
way 
that 
clearly
indicated 
that 
if 
he 
was 
not 
dancing 
it 
was 
because<p>
he 
would 
not 
and 
not
because 
he 
could 
not. 
In 
the 
middle 
of 
a 
figure 
he 
beckoned 
to 
Rostov
who 
was 
passing:

"This 
is 
not 
at 
all 
the 
thing," 
he 
said. 
"What 
sort 
of 
Polish
mazuwka 
is 
this? 
But 
she 
does 
dance 
splendidly."

Knowing 
that 
Denisov 
had 
a 
reputation 
even 
in 
Poland 
for 
the 
masterly
way 
in 
which 
he 
danced 
the 
mazurka, 
Nicholas 
ran 
up 
to 
Natasha:

"Go 
and 
choose 
Denisov. 
He 
is 
a 
real 
dancer, 
a 
wonder!"<p>
he 
said.

When 
it 
came 
to 
Natasha's 
turn 
to 
choose 
a 
partner, 
she 
rose 
and,
tripping 
rapidly 
across 
in 
her 
little 
shoes 
trimmed 
with 
bows, 
ran
timidly 
to 
the 
corner 
where 
Denisov 
sat. 
She 
saw 
that 
everybody 
was
looking 
at 
her 
and 
waiting. 
Nicholas 
saw 
that 
Denisov 
was 
refusing
though 
he 
smiled 
delightedly. 
He 
ran 
up 
to 
them.

"Please, 
Vasili 
Dmitrich," 
Natasha 
was 
saying, 
"do 
come!"

"Oh 
no, 
let 
me 
off, 
Countess," 
Denisov 
replied.

"Now 
then, 
Vaska," 
said 
Nicholas.

"They 
coax 
me 
as 
if 
I 
were 
Vaska 
the 
cat!" 
said 
Denisov 
jokingly.

"I'll 
sing 
for 
you 
a 
whole 
evening," 
said 
Natasha.

"Oh, 
the 
faiwy! 
She 
can 
do 
anything
