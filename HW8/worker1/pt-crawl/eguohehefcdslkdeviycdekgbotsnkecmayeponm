it
will</h1>certainly 
happen!" 
thought 
Pierre, 
glancing 
at 
those 
dazzling
shoulders 
close 
to 
his 
eyes.

Or 
he 
would 
suddenly 
feel 
ashamed 
of 
he 
knew 
not 
what. 
He 
felt 
it
awkward 
to 
attract 
everyone's 
attention 
and 
to 
be 
considered 
a
lucky 
man 
and, 
with 
his 
plain 
face, 
to 
be 
looked 
on 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
Paris
possessed 
of 
a 
Helen. 
"But 
no 
doubt 
it 
always 
is 
and 
must 
be 
so!"
he 
consoled 
himself. 
"And 
besides, 
what 
have 
I 
done 
to 
bring 
it 
about?
How 
did 
it 
begin? 
I 
traveled 
from 
Moscow 
with 
Prince 
Vasili. 
Then 
there
was 
nothing. 
So 
why 
should 
I 
not 
stay 
at 
his 
house? 
Then 
I 
played 
cards
with 
her 
and 
picked 
up 
her 
reticule 
and 
drove 
out 
with 
her. 
How 
did 
it
begin, 
when 
did 
it 
all 
come 
about?" 
And 
here 
he 
was 
sitting 
by 
her
side 
as 
her 
betrothed, 
seeing, 
hearing, 
feeling 
her 
nearness, 
her
breathing, 
her 
movements, 
her 
beauty. 
Then 
it 
would 
suddenly 
seem 
to 
him
that 
it 
was 
not 
she 
but 
he 
was 
so 
unusually 
beautiful, 
and 
that 
that 
was
why 
they 
all 
looked 
so 
at 
him, 
and 
flattered 
by 
this 
general 
admiration
he 
would 
expand 
his 
chest, 
raise 
his 
head, 
and<p>
rejoice 
at 
his 
good
fortune. 
Suddenly 
he 
heard 
a 
familiar 
voice 
repeating 
something 
to 
him 
a
second 
time. 
But 
Pierre 
was 
so 
absorbed 
that 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
what
was 
said.

"I 
am 
asking 
you 
when 
you 
last 
heard 
from 
Bolkonski," 
repeated
Prince 
Vasili 
a 
third 
time. 
"How 
absent-minded 
you 
are, 
my 
dear
fellow."

Prince 
Vasili 
smiled, 
and 
Pierre 
noticed 
that 
everyone 
was 
smiling 
at
him 
and 
Helene. 
"Well, 
what 
of 
it, 
if 
you 
all 
know 
it?" 
thought
Pierre. 
"What 
of 
it? 
It's 
the 
truth!" 
and 
he 
himself 
smiled 
his
gentle 
childlike 
smile, 
and 
Helene 
smiled 
too.

"When 
did 
you 
get 
the 
letter? 
Was 
it 
from 
Olmuetz?" 
repeated
Prince 
Vasili, 
who 
pretended 
to 
want 
to 
know 
this 
in<p>
order 
to 
settle 
a
dispute.

"How 
can 
one 
talk 
or 
think 
of 
such 
trifles?" 
thought 
Pierre.

"Yes, 
from 
Olmuetz,"<p>
he 
answered, 
with 
a 
sigh.

After 
supper 
Pierre 
with 
his 
partner 
followed 
the 
others 
into 
the
drawing 
room. 
The 
guests 
began 
to 
disperse, 
some 
without 
taking 
leave
of 
Helene. 
Some, 
as 
if 
unwilling 
to 
distract 
her 
from 
an 
important
occupation, 
came 
up 
to 
her 
for 
a 
moment 
and 
made 
haste 
to 
go 
away,
refusing 
to 
let 
her 
see 
them 
off. 
The 
diplomatist 
preserved 
a 
mournful
silence 
as 
he 
left 
the 
drawing 
room. 
He 
pictured 
the 
vanity 
of 
his
diplomatic 
career 
in 
comparison 
with 
Pierre's 
happiness. 
The 
old
general 
grumbled 
at 
his 
wife 
when 
she 
asked 
how 
his 
leg 
was. 
"Oh, 
the
old 
fool," 
he 
thought. 
"That 
Princess 
Helene 
will 
be 
beautiful
still 
when 
she's 
fifty."

"I 
think 
I 
may 
congratulate 
you," 
whispered 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
to 
the
old 
princess, 
kissing 
her 
soundly. 
"If 
I 
hadn't 
this 
headache 
I'd
have 
stayed 
longer."

The 
old 
princess 
did 
not 
reply, 
she 
was 
tormented 
by 
jealousy 
of 
her
daughter's 
happiness.

While 
the 
guests 
were 
taking 
their 
leave 
Pierre 
remained 
for 
a 
long 
time
alone 
with 
Helene 
in 
the 
little 
drawing 
room 
where 
they 
were 
sitting.
He 
had 
often 
before, 
during 
the 
last 
six 
weeks, 
remained 
alone 
with 
her,
but 
had 
never 
spoken 
to 
her 
of 
love. 
Now 
he 
felt 
that 
it 
was 
inevitable,
but 
he 
could 
not 
make 
up 
his 
mind 
to 
take 
the 
final 
step. 
He 
felt
ashamed; 
he 
felt 
that 
he<p>
was 
occupying 
someone 
else's 
place 
here
beside 
Helene. 
"This 
happiness 
is 
not 
for 
you," 
some 
inner 
voice
whispered 
to 
him. 
"This 
happiness 
is 
for 
those 
who 
have 
not 
in 
them
what 
there 
is 
in 
you."

But, 
as 
he 
had 
to 
say 
something, 
he 
began
