CHAPTER 
XXVII

At 
the 
appointed 
hour 
the 
prince, 
powdered 
and 
shaven, 
entered 
the
dining 
room 
where 
his 
daughter-in-law, 
Princess 
Mary, 
and 
Mademoiselle
Bourienne 
were 
already 
awaiting 
him 
together 
with 
his 
architect, 
who 
by
a 
strange 
caprice 
of 
his 
employer's 
was 
admitted 
to 
table 
though 
the
position 
of 
that 
insignificant 
individual 
was 
such 
as 
could 
certainly
not 
have 
caused 
him 
to 
expect 
that 
honor. 
The 
prince, 
who 
generally 
kept
very 
strictly 
to 
social 
distinctions 
and 
rarely 
admitted 
even 
important
government 
officials 
to 
his 
table, 
had 
unexpectedly 
selected 
Michael
Ivanovich 
(who 
always 
went 
into 
a 
corner 
to 
blow 
his 
nose 
on 
his
checked 
handkerchief) 
to<p>
illustrate 
the 
theory 
that 
all<p>
men 
are 
equals,
and 
had 
more 
than 
once 
impressed 
on 
his 
daughter 
that<p>
Michael 
Ivanovich
was 
"not 
a 
whit 
worse 
than 
you 
or 
I." 
At 
dinner 
the 
prince 
usually
spoke 
to 
the 
taciturn 
Michael 
Ivanovich 
more 
often 
than 
to 
anyone 
else.

In 
the 
dining 
room, 
which 
like 
all 
the 
rooms 
in 
<a href="/aVzUge/Lu1l51UVJhk.html">the</a> 
house 
was
exceedingly 
lofty, 
the 
members 
of 
the 
household 
and 
the 
footmen-one
behind 
each 
chair-stood 
waiting 
for 
the 
prince 
to 
enter. 
The 
head
butler, 
napkin 
on 
arm, 
was 
scanning 
the 
setting 
of 
the 
table, 
making
signs 
to 
the 
footmen, 
and 
anxiously 
glancing 
from 
the 
clock 
to 
the 
door
by 
which 
the 
prince 
was 
to 
enter. 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
looking 
at 
a 
large
gilt 
frame, 
new 
to 
him, 
containing 
the 
genealogical 
tree 
of 
the 
Princes
Bolkonski, 
opposite 
which 
hung 
another 
such 
frame 
with 
a 
badly 
painted
portrait 
(evidently 
by 
the 
hand 
of 
the 
artist 
belonging 
to 
the 
estate)
of 
a 
ruling 
prince, 
in 
a 
crown-an 
alleged 
descendant 
of 
Rurik 
<a href="/cZl/Ri5U63U.html">and
ancestor</a> 
of 
the 
Bolkonskis. 
Prince 
Andrew, 
looking 
again 
at 
that
genealogical 
tree, 
shook 
his 
head, 
laughing 
as 
a 
man 
laughs 
who 
looks 
at
a 
portrait 
so 
characteristic 
of 
the 
original 
as 
to 
be 
amusing.

"How 
thoroughly 
like 
him 
that 
is!" 
he 
said 
to 
Princess 
Mary, 
who 
had
come 
up 
to 
him.

Princess 
Mary 
looked 
at 
her 
brother 
in 
surprise. 
She 
did 
not 
understand
what 
he 
was 
laughing 
at. 
Everything 
her 
father 
did 
inspired 
her 
with
reverence 
and 
was 
beyond 
question.

"Everyone 
has 
his 
Achilles' 
heel," 
continued 
Prince 
Andrew.
"Fancy, 
with 
his 
powerful 
mind, 
indulging 
in 
such 
nonsense!"

Princess 
Mary 
could 
not 
understand 
the 
boldness 
of 
her 
brother's
criticism 
and 
was 
about 
to 
reply, 
when 
the 
expected 
footsteps 
were 
heard
coming 
from 
the 
study. 
The 
prince 
walked 
in 
quickly 
and 
jauntily 
as 
was
his 
wont, 
as 
if 
intentionally 
contrasting 
the 
briskness 
of 
his 
manners
with 
the 
strict 
formality 
of 
his 
house. 
At 
that 
moment 
the 
great 
clock
struck 
two 
and 
another 
with 
a 
shrill<p>
