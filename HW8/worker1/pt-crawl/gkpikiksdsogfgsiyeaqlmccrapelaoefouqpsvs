examine 
an</h1>act 
performed 
a 
month 
ago, 
then 
being 
in
different 
circumstances, 
I 
cannot 
help 
recognizing 
that 
if 
that 
act 
had
not 
been 
committed 
much 
that 
resulted 
from 
it-good, 
agreeable,<p>
and 
even
essential-would 
not 
have 
taken 
place. 
If 
I 
reflect 
on 
an 
action 
still
more 
remote, 
ten 
years 
ago 
or<p>
more, 
<a href="/cZl/TD4pM2CKMN4wvJ.html">then</a> 
the 
consequences 
of 
my 
action
are 
still 
plainer 
to 
me 
and 
I 
find 
it 
hard 
to 
imagine 
what 
would 
have
happened 
had 
that<p>
action 
not 
been 
performed. 
The 
farther 
I 
go 
back
in 
memory, 
or 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
the 
farther 
I 
go 
forward 
in 
my
judgment, 
the 
more 
doubtful 
becomes 
my 
belief 
in 
the 
freedom 
of 
my
action.

In 
history 
we 
find 
a 
very 
similar 
progress 
of 
conviction 
concerning
the 
part 
played 
by 
free 
will 
in 
the 
general 
affairs 
of 
humanity. 
A
contemporary 
event 
seems 
to 
us 
to 
be 
indubitably 
the 
doing 
of 
all 
the
known 
participants, 
but 
with 
a 
more 
remote 
event 
we 
already 
see 
its
inevitable 
results 
which 
prevent 
our 
considering 
anything 
else 
possible.
And 
the 
farther 
we 
go 
back 
in 
examining 
events 
the 
less 
arbitrary 
do
they 
appear.

The 
Austro-Prussian 
war 
appears 
to 
us 
undoubtedly 
the 
result 
of 
the
crafty 
conduct 
of 
Bismarck, 
and 
so 
on. 
The 
Napoleonic 
wars 
still 
seem
to 
us, 
though 
already 
questionably, 
to 
be 
the 
outcome 
of 
their 
heroes'
will. 
But 
in 
the 
Crusades 
we 
already 
see 
an 
event 
occupying 
its 
definite
place 
in 
history 
and 
without 
which 
we 
cannot 
imagine 
the 
modern 
history
of 
Europe, 
though 
to 
the 
chroniclers 
of 
the 
Crusades 
that 
event 
appeared
as 
merely 
due 
to 
the 
will 
of 
certain 
people. 
In 
regard 
to 
the 
migration
of 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NY9D9lLv5g.html">peoples</a> 
it 
does 
not 
enter 
anyone's 
head 
today 
to 
suppose 
that
the 
renovation 
of 
the 
European 
world 
depended 
on 
Attila's 
caprice. 
The
farther 
back 
in 
history 
the 
object 
of 
our 
observation 
lies, 
the 
more
doubtful 
does 
the 
free 
will 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NOe8cmeax7ny4epgGc.html">of</a> 
those 
concerned 
in 
the 
event 
become 
and
the 
more 
manifest 
the 
law 
of 
inevitability.

The 
third 
consideration 
is 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
we 
apprehend 
that
endless 
chain 
of 
causation 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hj8EbhW1ej1.html">inevitably</a> 
demanded 
by 
reason, 
in 
which 
each
phenomenon 
comprehended, 
and 
therefore 
man's 
every 
action, 
must 
have
its 
definite 
place 
as 
a 
result 
of 
what 
has 
gone 
before 
and 
as 
a 
cause 
of
what 
will 
follow.

The 
better 
we 
are 
acquainted 
with 
the 
physiological, 
psychological, 
and
historical 
laws 
deduced 
by 
observation 
and 
by 
which 
man 
is 
<a href="/cZl/fn1QrO4LEWO6h.html">controlled,
and</a> 
the 
more 
correctly 
we 
perceive 
the 
physiological, 
psychological,
and 
historical
