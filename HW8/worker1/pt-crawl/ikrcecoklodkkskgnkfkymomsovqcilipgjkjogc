of 
a 
known 
aim 
to 
which 
these
nations 
and 
humanity 
at 
large 
are 
tending.

At 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
works 
of 
all 
the 
modern 
historians 
<a href="/cZl/fV1hK7RPI5FNHn.html">from</a> 
Gibbon 
to
Buckle, 
despite 
their 
seeming 
disagreements 
and 
the 
apparent 
novelty 
of
their 
outlooks, 
lie 
those 
two 
old, 
unavoidable 
assumptions.

In 
the 
first 
place 
the 
historian 
describes 
the 
activity 
of 
individuals
who 
in 
his 
opinion<p>
have 
<a href="/aVzUge/qO4vf11EI.html">directed</a> 
humanity 
(one 
historian 
considers
only 
monarchs, 
generals, 
and 
ministers 
as 
being 
such 
men, 
while 
another
includes 
also 
orators, 
learned 
men, 
reformers, 
philosophers, 
and 
poets).
Secondly, 
it 
is 
assumed 
that 
the 
goal 
toward 
which 
humanity 
is 
being 
led
is 
known 
to 
the 
historians: 
to 
one 
of 
them 
this 
goal 
is 
the 
greatness 
of
the 
Roman, 
Spanish, 
or 
French 
realm; 
to 
another 
it 
is 
liberty, 
equality,
