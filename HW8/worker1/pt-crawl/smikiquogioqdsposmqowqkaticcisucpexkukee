talking 
of 
the</h1>political
news 
and 
common 
acquaintances 
like 
people 
who 
do 
not 
know 
each 
other
intimately. 
Prince 
Andrew 
spoke 
with 
some 
animation 
and 
interest 
only 
of
the 
new 
homestead 
he 
was 
constructing 
and 
its 
buildings, 
but 
even 
here,
while 
on 
the 
scaffolding, 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
a<p>
talk 
explaining 
the 
future
arrangements 
of 
the 
house, 
he 
interrupted 
himself:

"However, 
this 
is 
not 
at 
all 
interesting. 
Let 
us 
have 
dinner, 
and 
then
we'll 
set 
off."

At 
dinner, 
conversation 
turned 
on 
Pierre's 
marriage.

"I 
was 
very 
much 
surprised 
when 
I 
<a href="/cZl/nHL3COCd3hQrxS2omA.html">heard</a> 
of 
it," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew.

Pierre 
blushed, 
as 
he 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bF8Ro21viB.html">always</a> 
did 
when 
it 
was 
mentioned, 
and 
said
hurriedly: 
"I 
will 
tell 
you 
some 
time 
how 
it 
all 
happened. 
But 
you
know 
it 
is 
all 
<a href="/cZl/HQ2YmejJ4e1au.html">over,</a> 
and 
forever."

"Forever?" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew. 
"Nothing's 
forever."

"But 
you 
know 
how 
it 
all 
ended, 
don't 
you? 
You 
heard 
of 
the 
duel?"

"And 
so 
you 
had 
to 
go 
through 
that 
too!"

"One
