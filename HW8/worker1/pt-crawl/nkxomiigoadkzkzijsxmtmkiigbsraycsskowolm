Countess 
Mary 
sat 
down 
doing 
woolwork; 
Natasha
did 
not 
take 
her 
eyes 
off 
her 
husband. 
Nicholas 
and 
Denisov 
rose, 
asked
for 
their 
pipes, 
smoked, 
went 
to 
fetch 
more 
tea 
from 
Sonya-who 
sat 
weary
but 
resolute 
at 
the 
samovar-and 
questioned 
Pierre. 
The 
curly-headed,
delicate 
boy 
sat 
<a href="/cZl/eQ3XKBx4M6HrPAf.html">with</a>

exposed 
by 
his

collar, 
toward 
the 
place
where 
Pierre 
sat.

The 
conversation 
turned 
on 
the 
contemporary 
gossip 
about 
those 
in 
power,
in 
which 
most 
people 
see 
the 
chief 
interest 
of 
home 
politics. 
Denisov,
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
government 
on 
account 
of 
his 
own 
disappointments
in 
the 
service, 
heard 
with 
pleasure 
of 
the 
things 
done 
in 
Petersburg
which 
seemed 
to

sharp 
comments
