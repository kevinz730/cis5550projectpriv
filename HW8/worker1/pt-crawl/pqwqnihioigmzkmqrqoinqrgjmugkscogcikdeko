the 
one 
with 
the 
hooked 
nose, 
was 
already 
so
close 
that 
the 
expression 
of 
his 
face 
could 
be 
seen. 
And 
the 
excited,
alien 
face 
of 
that 
man, 
his 
bayonet 
hanging 
down, 
holding 
his 
breath,
and 
running 
so 
lightly, 
frightened 
Rostov. 
He 
seized 
his 
pistol 
and,
instead 
of 
firing 
it, 
flung 
it 
at 
the 
Frenchman 
and 
ran 
with 
all 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rq98AkS8C.html">his
might</a> 
toward 
the 
bushes. 
He 
did 
not 
now 
run 
with 
the 
feeling 
of 
doubt
and 
conflict 
with 
which 
he 
had 
trodden 
the<p>
Enns 
bridge, 
but 
with 
the
feeling 
of 
a 
hare 
fleeing 
from 
the 
hounds. 
One 
single 
sentiment, 
that
of 
fear 
for 
his 
young<p>
and 
happy 
life, 
possessed 
his 
whole 
being. 
Rapidly
leaping 
the 
furrows, 
he 
fled 
across 
the 
field 
with 
the 
impetuosity 
he
used 
to 
show 
at 
catchplay, 
now 
and 
then 
turning 
his 
good-natured, 
pale,
young 
face 
to 
look 
back. 
A 
shudder 
of 
terror 
went 
through 
him: 
"No,
better 
not 
look," 
he 
thought, 
but 
having 
reached 
the 
bushes 
he 
glanced
round 
once 
more. 
The 
French 
had 
fallen 
behind, 
and 
just 
as 
he 
looked
round 
the 
first 
man 
changed 
his 
run 
to 
a 
walk 
and, 
turning, 
shouted
something 
loudly 
to 
a 
comrade 
farther 
back. 
Rostov 
paused. 
"No,
there's 
some 
mistake," 
thought 
he. 
"They 
can't 
have 
wanted 
to
kill 
me." 
But 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
his 
left 
arm 
felt 
as 
heavy 
as 
if
a 
seventy-pound 
weight 
were 
tied 
to 
it. 
He 
could 
run 
no 
more. 
The
Frenchman 
also 
stopped 
and 
took 
aim. 
Rostov 
closed 
his 
eyes 
and 
stooped
down. 
One 
bullet 
and 
then 
another 
whistled 
past 
him. 
He 
mustered 
his
last 
remaining 
strength, 
took 
hold 
of 
his 
left 
hand 
with 
his 
right, 
and
reached 
the 
bushes. 
Behind 
these 
were 
some 
Russian 
sharpshooters.





CHAPTER 
XX

The 
infantry 
regiments 
that 
had 
been 
caught 
unawares 
in 
the 
outskirts
of 
the 
wood 
ran 
out 
of 
it, 
the 
different 
companies 
getting 
mixed, 
and
retreated 
as 
a 
disorderly 
crowd. 
One 
soldier, 
in 
his 
fear, 
uttered 
the
senseless 
cry, 
"Cut 
off!" 
that 
is 
so 
terrible 
in 
battle, 
and 
that
word 
infected 
the 
whole 
crowd 
with 
a 
feeling 
of 
panic.

"Surrounded! 
Cut 
off? 
We're 
lost!" 
shouted 
the 
fugitives.

The 
moment 
he 
heard 
the 
firing 
and 
the 
cry 
from 
behind, 
the 
general
realized 
that 
something 
dreadful 
had 
happened 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oh2to5lFuWA.html">his</a> 
regiment, 
and 
the
thought 
that 
he, 
an 
exemplary 
officer 
of 
many 
years' 
service 
who
had 
never 
been 
to 
blame, 
might<p>
be 
held 
responsible 
at 
headquarters
for 
negligence 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/GQe34bKMVG3tTlW.html">or</a> 
inefficiency 
so 
staggered 
him 
that, 
forgetting 
the
recalcitrant 
cavalry 
colonel, 
his 
own 
dignity 
as 
a 
general, 
and 
above
all 
quite 
forgetting 
the 
danger 
and 
all 
regard 
for 
self-preservation, 
he
clutched 
the 
crupper 
of 
his 
saddle 
and, 
spurring 
his 
horse, 
galloped 
to
the 
regiment 
under 
a 
hail 
of 
bullets 
which 
fell 
around, 
but 
fortunately
missed 
him. 
His 
one 
desire 
was 
to 
know 
what 
was 
happening<p>
and 
at 
any
cost 
correct,
