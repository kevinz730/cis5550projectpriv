waiting</h1>in 
the 
hall 
porter's 
little
lodge.

A 
minute 
later 
the 
old 
man's 
large 
stout 
figure 
in 
full-dress 
uniform,
his 
chest 
covered 
with 
orders 
and 
a 
scarf 
drawn 
round 
his 
stomach,
waddled 
out 
into 
the 
porch. 
He 
put 
on 
his 
hat 
with 
its 
peaks 
to 
<a href="/nocrawl/c8Rhi6R/dc12G3.html">the
sides</a> 
and, 
holding 
his 
gloves 
in 
his 
hand 
and 
walking 
with 
an 
effort
sideways 
down 
the 
steps 
to 
the 
level 
of 
the 
street, 
took 
in 
his 
hand 
the
report 
he 
had 
prepared 
for 
the 
Emperor.

There 
was 
running 
to 
and 
fro 
and 
whispering; 
another 
troyka 
flew
furiously 
up, 
and 
then 
all 
eyes 
were 
turned 
on 
an 
approaching 
sleigh
in 
which 
the 
figures 
of 
the 
Emperor 
and 
Volkonski 
could 
already 
be
descried.

From 
the 
habit 
of 
fifty 
years 
all 
this 
had 
a 
physically 
agitating 
effect
on 
the 
old 
general. 
He 
carefully 
and 
hastily 
felt 
himself 
all 
over,
readjusted 
his 
hat, 
and 
pulling 
himself 
together 
drew 
himself 
up 
and,
at 
the 
very 
moment 
when 
the 
Emperor, 
having 
alighted 
from 
the 
sleigh,
lifted 
his 
eyes 
to 
him, 
handed 
him 
the 
report 
and 
began 
speaking 
in 
his
smooth, 
ingratiating 
voice.

The 
Emperor 
with 
a 
rapid 
glance 
scanned 
Kutuzov 
from 
head 
to 
foot,
frowned 
for 
an 
instant, 
but 
immediately 
mastering 
himself 
went 
up 
to 
the
old 
man, 
extended 
his 
arms 
and 
embraced 
him. 
And 
this 
embrace 
too, 
owing
to 
a 
long-standing 
impression 
related 
to 
his 
innermost 
feelings, 
had 
its
usual 
effect 
on 
Kutuzov 
and 
he 
gave 
a 
sob.

The 
Emperor 
greeted 
the 
officers<p>
and 
the 
Semenov 
guard, 
and 
again
pressing 
the 
old 
man's 
hand 
went 
with 
him 
into 
the 
castle.

When 
alone 
with 
the 
field 
marshal 
the 
Emperor 
expressed 
his
dissatisfaction 
at 
the 
slowness 
of 
the 
pursuit 
and 
at 
the 
mistakes 
made
at 
Krasnoe 
and 
the 
Berezina, 
and 
informed 
him 
of 
his 
intentions 
for 
a
future 
campaign 
abroad. 
Kutuzov 
made 
no 
rejoinder 
or 
remark. 
The 
same
submissive, 
expressionless 
look 
with 
which 
he 
had 
listened 
to 
the
Emperor's 
commands 
on 
the 
field 
of 
Austerlitz 
seven 
years 
before 
settled
on 
his 
face 
now.

When 
Kutuzov 
came 
out 
of 
the 
study 
and 
with 
lowered 
head 
was 
crossing
the 
ballroom 
with 
his 
heavy 
waddling 
gait, 
he 
was 
arrested 
by 
someone's
voice 
saying:

"Your 
Serene<p>
Highness!"

Kutuzov 
raised 
his 
head 
and 
looked 
for 
a 
long 
while 
into 
the 
eyes 
of
Count 
Tolstoy, 
who 
stood 
before 
him 
holding 
a 
silver 
salver 
on 
which 
lay
a 
small 
object. 
Kutuzov 
seemed 
not 
to 
understand 
what 
was 
expected 
of
him.

Suddenly 
he 
seemed 
to 
remember; 
a 
scarcely 
perceptible 
smile 
flashed
across 
his 
puffy 
face, 
and 
bowing 
low 
and 
respectfully 
he 
took 
the
object 
that 
lay 
on 
the 
salver. 
It 
was 
the 
Order 
of 
St. 
George 
of 
the
First 
Class.





CHAPTER 
XI

Next 
day 
the 
field 
marshal 
gave 
a 
dinner 
and 
ball 
which 
the 
Emperor
honored 
by<p>
his 
presence. 
Kutuzov 
had 
received 
the 
Order 
of 
St. 
George
of 
the 
First 
Class 
and 
the 
Emperor 
showed 
him 
the 
highest 
honors, 
but
everyone 
knew 
of 
the 
imperial 
dissatisfaction 
with 
him. 
The 
proprieties
were 
observed 
and 
the 
Emperor 
was 
the 
first 
to 
set 
that 
example,
but 
everybody 
understood 
that 
the 
old 
man 
was 
blameworthy 
and
good-for-nothing. 
When 
Kutuzov, 
conforming 
to 
a 
custom 
of 
Catherine's
day, 
ordered 
the 
standards<p>
that 
had 
been 
captured 
to 
be 
lowered 
at 
the
Emperor's 
feet 
on 
his 
entering 
the 
ballroom, 
the 
Emperor 
made 
a 
wry 
face
and 
muttered 
something 
in 
which 
some 
people 
caught 
the<p>
words, 
"the 
old
comedian."

The 
Emperor's 
displeasure 
with 
Kutuzov 
was 
specially 
increased 
at 
Vilna
by 
the 
fact 
that 
Kutuzov 
evidently 
could 
not 
or 
would 
not 
understand 
the
importance 
of 
the 
coming 
campaign.

When 
on 
the 
following 
morning 
the 
Emperor 
said 
to 
the 
officers 
assembled
about 
him: 
"You 
have 
not 
only 
saved 
Russia, 
you 
have 
saved 
Europe!" 
they
all 
understood 
that 
the 
war 
was 
not 
ended.

Kutuzov 
alone 
would 
not 
see 
this 
and 
openly 
expressed 
his 
opinion 
that
no 
fresh 
war 
could
