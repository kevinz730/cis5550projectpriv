gave 
orders
to 
find 
and 
execute 
the 
incendiaries. 
And 
the 
scoundrel 
Rostopchin

punished 
by 
an 
order

his 
houses.

With 
regard 
to 
administrative 
matters, 
Moscow 
was 
granted 
a
constitution. 
A 
municipality 
was 
established 
and 
the 
following
announcement 
issued:


INHABITANTS 
OF 
MOSCOW!

Your 
misfortunes 
are 
cruel, 
but 
His 
Majesty 
the 
Emperor 
and 
King
desires 
to 
arrest 
their 
course. 
Terrible 
examples 
have 
taught 
you 
how 
he
punishes 
disobedience 
and 
crime. 
Strict 
measures 
have 
been 
taken 
to
put 
an 
end 
to 
disorder 
and 
to 
re-establish 
public 
security. 
A
paternal 
administration, 
chosen 
from 
among 
yourselves, 
will 
form 
your
municipality 
or 
city 
government. 
It 
will 
take 
care 
of 
you, 
of 
your
needs, 
and 
of 
your 
welfare. 
Its 
members 
will 
be 
distinguished 
by 
a 
red
ribbon 
worn 
across 
the 
shoulder, 
and 
the 
mayor 
of 
<a href="/cZl/mr5byQW9EbhW2vxtj.html">the</a> 
city 
will 
wear
a 
white 
belt 
as<p>
well. 
But 
when<p>
not 
on 
duty 
they 
will 
only 
wear 
a 
red
ribbon 
round 
the 
left 
arm.

The 
city 
<a href="/aVzUge/lX3eplAZ1Im2mGGRm.html">police</a> 
is 
established 
on 
its 
former 
footing, 
and 
better 
order
already 
prevails 
in 
consequence 
of 
its 
activity. 
The 
government 
has
appointed 
two 
commissaries 
general, 
or 
chiefs 
of 
police, 
and 
twenty
commissaries 
or 
captains 
of 
wards 
have 
been 
appointed 
to 
the 
different
wards 
of 
the 
city. 
You 
will 
recognize 
them 
by 
the 
white 
ribbon 
they 
will
wear 
on 
the 
left 
arm. 
Several 
churches 
of 
different 
denominations 
are
open, 
and 
divine 
service 
is 
performed 
in 
them 
unhindered. 
Your 
fellow
citizens 
are 
returning 
every 
day 
to 
their 
<a href="/aVzUge/UQ9sGG5O4Pm.html">homes</a> 
and 
orders 
have 
been
given 
that 
they 
should 
find 
in 
them 
the 
help 
and 
protection 
due 
to
their 
misfortunes. 
These 
are 
the 
measures 
the 
government 
has 
adopted 
to
re-establish 
order 
and 
relieve 
your 
condition. 
But 
to 
achieve 
this
aim 
it 
is 
necessary 
that 
you 
should 
add 
your 
efforts 
and 
should, 
if
possible, 
forget 
the 
misfortunes 
<a href="/cZl/UT5bWUL3We9GBhrH.html">you</a> 
have 
suffered, 
should 
entertain
the 
hope 
of 
a 
less 
cruel 
fate, 
should 
be 
certain 
that 
inevitable 
and
ignominious 
death 
awaits 
those 
who 
make 
any 
attempt 
on 
your 
persons 
or
on 
what 
remains 
of 
your 
property, 
and 
finally 
that 
you 
should 
not 
doubt
that 
these 
will 
be 
safeguarded, 
since 
such 
is 
the 
will 
of 
the 
greatest
and 
most 
just 
of 
monarchs. 
Soldiers 
and 
citizens, 
of 
whatever 
nation 
you
may 
be, 
re-establish 
public 
confidence, 
the 
source 
of 
the 
welfare 
of
a 
state, 
live 
like 
brothers, 
render 
mutual 
aid 
and 
protection 
one 
to
another, 
unite 
to 
defeat 
the 
intentions 
of 
the 
evil-minded, 
obey 
the
military 
and 
civil 
authorities, 
and 
your 
tears 
will 
soon 
cease 
to 
flow!
