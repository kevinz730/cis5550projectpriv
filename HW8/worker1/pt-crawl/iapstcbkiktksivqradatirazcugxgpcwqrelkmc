me,"
said 
he,</h1>standing 
before 
Princess 
Mary 
and 
turning 
red, 
but 
not 
taking
his 
departure.

Natasha 
gave 
him 
her 
hand 
and 
went 
out. 
Princess 
Mary 
on 
the 
other 
hand
instead 
of 
going 
away 
sank 
into 
an 
armchair, 
and 
looked 
sternly 
and
intently 
at 
him 
with 
her 
deep, 
radiant 
eyes. 
The 
weariness 
she
had 
plainly 
shown 
before 
had 
now 
quite 
passed 
off. 
With 
a 
deep 
and
long-drawn 
sigh 
she 
seemed 
to 
be 
prepared 
for 
a 
lengthy 
talk.

When 
Natasha 
left 
the 
room 
Pierre's 
confusion 
and 
awkwardness
immediately 
vanished 
and 
were 
replaced 
by 
eager 
excitement. 
He 
quickly
moved 
an 
armchair 
toward 
Princess 
Mary.

"Yes, 
I 
wanted 
to 
tell 
you," 
said 
he, 
answering 
her 
look 
as 
if 
she 
had
spoken. 
"Princess, 
help 
me! 
What 
am 
I 
to 
do? 
Can 
I 
hope? 
Princess, 
my
dear 
friend, 
listen! 
I 
know 
it 
all. 
I 
know 
I<p>
am 
not 
worthy 
of 
her, 
I
know 
it's 
impossible 
to 
speak 
of 
it 
now. 
But 
I 
want 
to 
be 
a 
brother 
to
her. 
No, 
not 
that, 
I 
don't, 
I 
can't..."

He 
paused 
and 
rubbed 
his 
face 
and 
eyes 
with 
his 
hands.

"Well," 
he 
went 
on 
with 
an 
evident 
effort 
at 
self-control 
and 
coherence.
"I 
don't 
know 
when 
I 
began 
to 
love 
her, 
but 
I 
have 
loved 
her 
and 
her
alone 
all 
my 
life, 
and 
I 
love 
her 
so 
that 
I 
cannot 
imagine 
life 
without
her. 
I 
cannot 
propose 
to 
her 
at 
present, 
but 
the 
thought 
that
perhaps 
she 
might 
someday 
be 
my 
wife 
and 
that 
I 
may 
be 
missing 
that
possibility... 
that 
possibility... 
is 
terrible. 
Tell 
me, 
can 
I 
hope?
Tell 
me 
what 
I 
am 
to 
do, 
dear 
princess!" 
he 
added 
after 
a 
pause, 
and
touched 
her 
hand 
as 
she 
did 
not 
reply.

"I 
am 
thinking 
of 
what 
you 
have 
told 
me," 
answered 
Princess 
Mary.
"This 
is 
what 
I 
will 
say. 
You 
are 
right 
that 
to 
speak 
to 
her 
of<p>
love 
at
present..."

Princess 
Mary 
stopped. 
She 
was 
going 
to 
say 
that 
to 
speak 
of 
love 
was
impossible, 
but 
she 
stopped 
because 
she 
had 
seen 
by 
the 
sudden 
change
in 
Natasha 
two 
days 
before 
that 
she 
would<p>
not 
only 
not 
be 
hurt 
if 
Pierre
spoke 
of 
his 
love, 
but 
that 
it 
was 
the 
very 
thing 
she 
wished 
for.

"To 
speak 
to 
her 
now 
wouldn't 
do," 
said 
the 
princess 
all 
the 
same.

"But 
what 
am 
I 
to 
do?"

"Leave 
it 
to 
me," 
said 
Princess 
Mary. 
"I 
know..."

Pierre 
was 
looking 
into 
Princess 
Mary's 
eyes.

"Well?... 
Well?..." 
he 
said.

"I 
know 
that 
she 
loves... 
will 
love 
you," 
Princess 
Mary 
corrected
herself.

Before 
her 
words 
were 
out, 
Pierre 
had 
sprung 
up 
and 
with 
a 
frightened
expression 
seized 
Princess 
Mary's 
hand.

"What 
makes 
you 
think 
so? 
You 
think 
I 
may 
hope? 
You
