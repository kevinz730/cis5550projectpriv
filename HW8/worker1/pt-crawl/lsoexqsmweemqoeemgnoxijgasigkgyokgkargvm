sadly 
and</h1>seriously. 
This 
news
grieved 
him 
and 
yet 
he 
was 
pleased.

As 
soon 
as 
he 
learned 
that 
the 
Russian 
army 
was 
in 
such 
a 
hopeless
situation 
it 
occurred 
to 
him 
that 
it 
was 
he 
who 
was 
destined 
to 
lead 
it
out 
of 
this 
position; 
that 
here 
was 
the 
Toulon 
that 
would 
lift 
him<p>
from
the 
ranks 
of 
obscure 
officers 
and 
offer 
him 
the 
first 
step 
to 
fame!
Listening 
to 
Bilibin 
he 
was 
already 
imagining 
how 
on 
reaching 
the 
army
he 
would 
give 
an 
opinion 
at 
the 
war 
council 
which 
would 
be 
the 
only 
one
that 
could 
save 
the 
army, 
and 
how 
he 
alone 
would 
be 
entrusted 
with 
the
executing 
of 
the 
plan.

"Stop 
this 
<a href="/aVzUge/PC6XKBx6fnq.html">jesting,"</a> 
he 
said.

"I 
am 
not 
jesting," 
Bilibin 
went 
on. 
"Nothing 
is 
truer 
or 
sadder.
These 
gentlemen 
ride 
onto 
the 
bridge 
alone 
and 
wave 
white 
handkerchiefs;
they 
assure 
the 
officer 
on 
duty 
that 
they, 
the 
marshals, 
are 
on
their 
way 
to 
negotiate 
with 
Prince 
Auersperg. 
He 
lets<p>
them 
enter 
the
tete-de-pont. 
* 
They 
spin 
him 
a 
thousand 
gasconades, 
saying 
that
the 
war 
is 
over, 
that 
the 
Emperor 
Francis 
is 
arranging 
a 
meeting 
with
Bonaparte, 
that 
they 
desire 
to 
see 
Prince 
Auersperg, 
and 
so 
on. 
The
officer 
sends 
for 
Auersperg; 
these 
gentlemen 
embrace 
the 
officers, 
crack
jokes, 
sit 
on 
the 
cannon, 
and 
meanwhile 
a 
French 
battalion 
gets 
to
the 
bridge 
unobserved, 
flings 
the 
bags 
of 
incendiary 
material 
into
the 
water, 
and 
approaches 
the 
tete-de-pont. 
At 
length 
appears 
the
lieutenant 
general, 
our 
dear 
Prince 
Auersperg 
von 
Mautern 
himself.
'Dearest 
foe! 
Flower 
of 
the 
Austrian 
army, 
hero 
of 
the 
Turkish 
wars!
Hostilities 
are 
ended, 
we 
can 
shake 
one 
another's 
hand.... 
The
Emperor
