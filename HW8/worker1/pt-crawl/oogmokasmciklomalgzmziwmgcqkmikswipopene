very 
fat 
girl 
in</h1>a 
white 
silk 
dress 
sat
apart 
on 
a 
low 
bench, 
to 
the 
back 
of 
which 
a 
piece 
of 
green 
cardboard
was 
glued. 
They 
all 
sang 
something. 
When 
they 
had 
finished 
their 
song
the 
girl 
in 
white 
went 
up 
to 
the 
prompter's 
box 
and 
a 
man 
with 
tight
silk 
trousers 
over 
his 
stout 
<a href="/cZl/Gt84qEo4.html">legs,</a> 
and 
holding 
a 
plume 
<a href="/aVzUge/oP1JdRQ2jTVGx4.html">and</a> 
a 
dagger,
went 
up 
to 
her 
and 
began 
singing, 
waving 
<a href="/cZl/Of2bWUL8.html">his</a> 
arms 
about.

First 
the 
man 
in 
the 
tight 
trousers 
sang 
alone, 
then 
she 
sang, 
then 
they
both 
paused 
while 
the 
orchestra 
played 
and 
the 
man 
fingered 
the 
hand
of 
the 
girl 
in 
white, 
obviously 
awaiting 
the 
beat 
to 
start 
singing 
with
her. 
They 
sang 
together 
and 
everyone 
in 
the 
theater 
began 
clapping
and 
shouting, 
while 
the 
man 
and 
woman 
on 
the 
stage-who 
represented
lovers-began 
smiling, 
spreading 
out 
their 
arms, 
and 
bowing.

After 
her 
life 
in 
the 
country, 
and 
in 
her 
present 
serious 
mood, 
all 
this
seemed 
grotesque 
and 
amazing 
to 
Natasha. 
She 
could 
not 
follow 
the 
opera
nor 
even 
listen 
to 
the 
music; 
she 
saw 
only 
the 
painted 
cardboard 
and 
the
queerly 
dressed 
men 
and 
women 
who 
moved, 
spoke, 
and 
sang 
so 
strangely 
in
that 
brilliant 
light. 
She 
knew 
what 
it 
was 
all 
meant 
to 
represent, 
but
it 
was 
<a href="/cZl/CK3YIp8qRU2.html">so</a> 
pretentiously 
false 
and 
unnatural 
that 
she 
first 
felt 
ashamed
for 
the 
actors 
and 
then 
amused 
at 
them. 
She 
<a href="/cZl/iF1Xiis9P8C.html">looked</a> 
at 
the 
faces 
of 
the
audience, 
seeking 
in 
them 
the 
same 
sense 
of 
ridicule 
and 
perplexity 
she
herself 
experienced, 
but 
they 
all 
seemed 
attentive 
to 
what 
was 
happening
on 
the 
stage, 
and 
expressed 
delight 
which 
to 
Natasha 
seemed 
feigned.
"I 
suppose 
it 
has 
to 
be 
like 
this!" 
she 
thought. 
She 
kept 
looking
round 
in 
turn 
at 
the 
rows 
of 
pomaded 
heads 
in 
the 
stalls 
and 
then 
at
the 
seminude 
women 
in 
the 
boxes, 
especially 
at 
Helene 
in 
the 
next 
box,
who-apparently 
quite 
unclothed-sat 
with 
a 
quiet 
tranquil 
smile, 
not
taking 
her 
eyes 
off
