to 
him
to 
stop. 
The</h1>lunatic's 
solemn, 
gloomy 
face 
was 
thin 
and 
yellow, 
with
its 
beard 
growing 
in 
uneven 
tufts. 
His 
black, 
agate 
pupils 
with
saffron-yellow 
whites 
moved 
restlessly 
near 
the 
lower 
eyelids.

"Stop! 
Pull 
up, 
I 
tell 
you!" 
he 
cried 
in 
a 
piercing 
voice, 
and 
again
shouted 
something 
breathlessly 
with 
emphatic 
intonations 
and 
gestures.

Coming 
abreast 
of 
the 
caleche 
he 
ran 
beside 
it.

"Thrice 
have 
they 
slain 
me, 
thrice 
have 
I 
risen 
from 
the 
dead. 
They
stoned 
me, 
crucified 
me... 
I 
shall 
<a href="/cZl/aK9AgW7Uo9.html">rise...</a> 
shall 
rise... 
shall 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UMG3t5uq4VWVhi.html">rise.
They</a> 
have 
torn 
my 
body. 
The 
kingdom 
of 
God 
will 
be 
overthrown... 
Thrice
will 
I 
overthrow 
it 
and 
thrice 
re-establish 
it!" 
he 
cried, 
raising 
his
voice 
higher 
and 
higher.

Count 
Rostopchin 
suddenly 
grew 
pale 
as 
he 
had 
done 
when 
the 
crowd 
closed
in 
on 
Vereshchagin. 
He 
turned 
away. 
"Go 
fas... 
faster!" 
<a href="/aVzUge/YE7mbEd9f4tHLaX.html">he</a> 
cried 
in 
a
trembling 
voice 
to 
his 
coachman. 
The 
caleche 
flew 
over 
the 
ground 
as
fast 
as 
the 
horses 
could 
draw 
it, 
but 
for 
a 
long 
time 
<a href="/cZl/Ix423w.html">Count</a> 
Rostopchin
still 
heard 
the 
insane 
despairing 
screams 
growing 
fainter 
in 
the
distance, 
while 
his 
eyes 
saw 
nothing 
but 
the 
astonished, 
frightened,
bloodstained 
face 
of 
"the 
traitor" 
in 
the 
fur-lined 
coat.

Recent 
as 
that 
mental 
picture 
was, 
Rostopchin 
already 
felt 
that 
it 
<a href="/aVzUge/WD9fOHvf2Wu9.html">had
cut</a> 
deep 
into 
his 
heart 
and 
drawn 
blood. 
Even 
now 
he 
felt 
clearly 
that
the 
gory 
trace 
of 
that 
recollection 
would 
not 
pass 
with 
time, 
but 
that
the 
terrible 
memory 
would, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
dwell 
in 
his 
heart 
ever 
more
cruelly 
and 
painfully 
to 
the 
end 
of 
his 
life. 
He 
seemed 
still 
to 
hear
the 
sound 
of 
his 
own 
words: 
"Cut 
him 
down!
