Pierre 
had 
noticed</h1>in 
his
friend's 
look 
was 
now 
still 
more 
clearly 
expressed 
in 
the 
smile
with 
which 
he 
listened 
to 
Pierre, 
especially 
when 
he 
spoke 
with 
joyful
animation 
of 
the 
past 
or 
the 
future. 
It 
was 
as 
if 
Prince 
Andrew 
would
have 
liked 
to 
sympathize 
with 
what 
Pierre 
was 
saying, 
but 
could 
not.
The 
latter 
began 
to 
feel 
that 
it 
was 
in 
bad 
taste 
to 
speak 
of 
his
enthusiasms, 
dreams, 
and 
hopes 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/uFR4NuySF7U7.html">happiness</a> 
or 
goodness, 
in 
Prince
Andrew's 
presence. 
He 
was<p>
ashamed 
to 
express 
his 
new 
Masonic 
views,
which 
had 
been 
particularly 
revived 
and 
strengthened 
by 
his 
late 
tour.
He 
checked 
himself, 
fearing 
to 
seem 
naive, 
yet 
he 
felt 
an 
irresistible
desire 
to 
show 
his 
friend 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
that 
he 
was 
now 
a 
quite
different, 
and 
better, 
Pierre 
than 
he 
had 
been 
in 
Petersburg.

"I 
can't 
tell 
you 
how 
much 
I 
have 
lived 
through 
since 
then. 
I 
hardly
know 
myself 
again."

"Yes, 
we 
have 
altered 
much, 
very 
much, 
since 
then," 
said 
Prince
Andrew.

"Well, 
and 
you? 
What 
are 
your 
plans?"

"Plans!" 
repeated 
Prince 
Andrew 
ironically. 
"My 
plans?" 
he 
said,
as 
if 
astonished 
at 
the 
word. 
"Well, 
you 
see, 
I'm 
building.
