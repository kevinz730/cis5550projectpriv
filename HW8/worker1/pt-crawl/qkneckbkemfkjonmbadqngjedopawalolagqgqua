and 
fear 
he 
had 
betrayed 
before 
his
subordinates. 
"The 
mob 
is 
terrible-disgusting," 
he 
said 
to 
himself
in 
French. 
"They 
are 
like 
wolves 
whom 
nothing 
but 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/LN9MCK1WorqI.html">flesh</a> 
can 
appease."
"Count! 
One 
God 
is 
above 
us 
both!"-Vereshchagin's 
words 
suddenly
recurred 
to 
him, 
and 
a 
disagreeable 
shiver 
ran 
down 
his 
back. 
But 
this
was 
only 
a 
momentary 
feeling 
and 
Count 
Rostopchin<p>
smiled 
disdainfully
at 
himself. 
"I<p>
had 
other 
duties," 
thought 
he. 
"The 
people 
had 
to 
be
appeased. 
Many 
other 
victims 
have 
perished 
and 
are 
perishing 
for 
the
public 
good"-and 
he 
began 
thinking 
of 
his 
social 
duties 
to 
his<p>
family
and 
to 
the 
city 
entrusted 
to 
him, 
and 
of 
himself-not 
himself 
as 
Theodore
Vasilyevich 
Rostopchin 
(he 
fancied 
that 
Theodore 
Vasilyevich 
Rostopchin
was 
sacrificing 
himself 
for 
the 
public 
good) 
but 
himself 
as 
governor,
the 
representative 
of 
authority 
and 
of 
the 
Tsar. 
"Had 
I 
been 
simply
Theodore 
Vasilyevich 
my 
course 
of 
<a href="/cZl/YF1n5xhd4CKY.html">action</a> 
would 
have 
been 
quite
different, 
but 
it 
was 
my 
duty 
to 
safeguard 
my 
life 
and 
dignity 
as
commander 
in 
chief."

Lightly 
swaying 
on 
the 
flexible 
springs 
of 
his 
carriage 
and 
no 
longer
hearing 
the 
terrible 
sounds 
of 
the 
crowd, 
Rostopchin 
grew 
physically
calm 
and, 
as 
always 
happens, 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
became 
physically 
tranquil
his 
mind 
devised 
reasons 
why 
he 
should 
be 
mentally 
tranquil 
too. 
The
thought 
which 
tranquillized 
Rostopchin 
was 
not 
a 
new 
one. 
Since 
the
world 
began 
and 
men 
have 
killed 
one 
another 
no 
one 
has 
ever 
committed
such 
a 
crime 
against 
his 
<a href="/cZl/cw2Ptam8tUD0iPTJ.html">fellow</a> 
man 
without 
comforting 
himself 
with
this 
same 
idea. 
This 
idea 
is 
le 
bien 
public, 
the 
hypothetical 
welfare 
of
other 
people.

To 
a 
man 
not 
swayed 
by 
passion 
that 
welfare 
is 
never 
certain, 
but 
he
who 
commits 
such 
a 
crime 
always 
knows 
just 
where 
that 
welfare 
lies. 
And
Rostopchin 
now 
knew 
it.

Not 
only 
did 
his 
reason 
not 
reproach 
him 
for 
what 
he 
had 
done, 
but
he 
even 
found 
cause 
for 
self-satisfaction 
in 
having 
so 
successfully
contrived 
to 
avail 
himself 
of 
a 
convenient 
opportunity 
to 
punish 
a
criminal 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
pacify 
the 
mob.

"Vereshchagin 
was<p>
tried 
and 
condemned<p>
to 
death," 
thought 
Rostopchin
(though 
the 
Senate 
had 
only 
condemned 
Vereshchagin 
to 
hard 
labor), 
"he
was 
a 
traitor 
and 
a 
spy. 
I 
could 
not 
let 
him 
go 
unpunished 
and 
so 
I 
have
killed 
two 
birds 
with 
one 
stone: 
to 
appease 
the 
mob 
I 
gave 
them 
a 
victim
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
punished
