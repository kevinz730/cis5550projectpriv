We 
must
live, 
we 
must 
love, 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Wj6ohMq99Ix.html">we</a> 
must 
believe 
that 
we

not 
only 
today 
on

forever, 
there, 
in
the 
Whole," 
said 
Pierre, 
and 
he 
pointed 
to 
the 
sky.

Prince 
Andrew 
stood 
leaning 
on 
the 
railing 
of 
the 
raft 
listening 
to
Pierre, 
and 
he 
gazed 
with 
his 
eyes 
<a href="/cZl/dA2tQI5SC4.html">fixed</a> 
on 
the 
red 
reflection 
of 
the
sun 
gleaming 
on 
the 
blue 
waters. 
There 
was 
perfect 
stillness. 
Pierre
became 
silent. 
The<p>
raft 
had 
long 
since 
stopped 
and 
only 
the 
waves 
of 
the
current<p>
beat 
softly 
against 
it 
below. 
Prince 
Andrew 
felt 
as 
if 
the 
sound
of 
the 
waves 
kept 
up 
a 
refrain 
to 
Pierre's 
words, 
whispering:

"It 
is 
true, 
believe 
it."

He 
sighed, 
and 
glanced 
with 
a 
radiant, 
childlike, 
tender 
look 
at
Pierre's 
face, 
flushed 
and 
rapturous, 
but 
yet 
<a href="/cZl/Je29s0aAcKW.html">shy</a> 
before 
his 
superior
friend.

"Yes, 
if 
it 
only 
were 
so!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew. 
"However, 
it 
is
time 
to 
get 
on," 
he 
added, 
and, 
stepping 
off 
the 
raft, 
he 
looked 
up
at 
the 
sky 
to 
which 
Pierre 
had 
pointed, 
and 
for 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/HK3WVP4FWU2At.html">first</a> 
time 
since
Austerlitz 
saw 
that 
high, 
everlasting 
sky 
he 
had 
seen 
while 
lying 
on
that 
battlefield; 
and 
something 
that 
had 
long 
been 
slumbering, 
something
that 
was 
best 
within 
him, 
suddenly<p>
awoke, 
joyful 
and 
youthful, 
in 
his
soul. 
It 
vanished 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
returned 
to 
the 
customary 
conditions
of 
his 
life, 
but 
he 
knew 
that 
this 
feeling 
which 
he 
did 
not 
know 
how 
to
develop 
existed 
within 
him. 
His 
meeting 
with 
Pierre 
formed 
an 
epoch 
in
Prince 
Andrew's 
life. 
Though 
outwardly 
he 
continued 
to 
live 
in 
the
same 
old 
way, 
inwardly 
he 
began 
a 
new 
life.





CHAPTER 
XIII

It 
was 
getting 
dusk 
when 
Prince 
Andrew 
and 
Pierre 
drove 
up 
to 
the 
front
entrance 
of 
the 
house 
at 
Bald<p>
Hills. 
As 
they 
approached 
the 
house,
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
a 
smile 
drew 
Pierre's 
attention 
to 
a 
commotion
going 
on 
at 
the 
back 
porch. 
A 
woman, 
bent 
with 
age, 
with 
a 
wallet 
on 
her
back, 
and 
a 
short, 
long-haired, 
young 
man
