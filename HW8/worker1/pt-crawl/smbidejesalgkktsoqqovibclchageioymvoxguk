all 
Prince 
Andrew 
said.</h1>But 
that 
one 
word 
expressed
an 
entreaty, 
a 
threat, 
and 
above 
all 
conviction 
that 
she 
would 
herself
regret 
her 
words. 
But 
she 
went 
on 
hurriedly:

"You 
treat 
me 
like 
an 
invalid 
or 
a 
child. 
I 
see 
it 
all! 
Did 
you 
behave
like 
that 
six 
months 
ago?"

"Lise, 
I 
beg 
you 
to 
desist," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
still 
more
emphatically.

Pierre, 
who 
had 
been 
growing 
more 
and 
more 
agitated 
as 
he 
listened 
to
all 
this, 
rose 
and 
approached 
the 
princess. 
He 
seemed 
unable 
to 
bear 
the
sight 
of 
tears 
and 
was 
ready 
to 
cry 
himself.

"Calm 
yourself, 
Princess! 
It 
seems 
so 
to 
you 
because.... 
I<p>
assure<p>
you
I 
myself 
have 
experienced 
... 
and 
so 
... 
because 
... 
No, 
excuse 
me!
An 
outsider 
is 
out 
of 
place 
here.... 
No, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/yFQ4tvJE6IgdEd6zT.html">don't</a> 
distress 
yourself....
Good-by!"

Prince 
Andrew 
caught 
him 
by 
the 
hand.

"No, 
wait, 
Pierre! 
The 
princess 
is 
too 
kind 
to 
wish 
to 
deprive 
me 
of
the<p>
pleasure 
of 
spending 
the 
evening 
with 
you."

"No, 
he 
thinks 
only 
of 
himself," 
muttered 
the 
princess 
without
restraining 
her 
angry 
tears.

"Lise!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
dryly, 
raising 
his 
voice 
to 
the 
pitch
which 
indicates 
that 
patience 
is 
exhausted.

Suddenly 
the 
angry, 
squirrel-like 
expression 
of 
the 
princess' 
pretty
face 
changed 
into 
a 
winning 
and 
piteous 
look 
of 
fear. 
Her 
<a href="/aVzUge/LQ8pDix3OpC0cmeax.html">beautiful</a> 
eyes
glanced 
askance 
at 
her 
husband's 
face, 
and 
her 
own 
assumed 
the<p>
timid,
deprecating 
expression 
of 
a 
dog 
when 
it 
rapidly 
but 
feebly 
wags 
its
drooping 
tail.

"Mon 
Dieu, 
mon 
Dieu!" 
she 
muttered, 
and 
lifting 
her 
dress 
with 
one
hand 
she 
went 
up 
to 
her 
husband 
and 
kissed 
him 
on 
the 
forehead.

"Good 
night, 
Lise," 
said 
he, 
rising 
and 
courteously 
kissing 
her 
hand
as 
he 
would 
have 
done 
to 
a 
stranger.





CHAPTER 
VIII

The 
friends 
were 
silent. 
Neither 
cared 
to 
begin 
talking. 
Pierre
continually 
glanced 
at 
Prince 
Andrew; 
Prince 
Andrew 
rubbed 
his 
forehead
with 
his 
small 
hand.

"Let 
us 
go 
and 
have 
supper," 
he 
said 
with 
a 
sigh, 
going 
to 
the 
door.

They<p>
entered 
the 
elegant, 
newly 
decorated, 
and 
luxurious 
dining 
room.
Everything 
from 
the 
table 
napkins 
to 
the 
silver, 
china, 
and 
glass 
bore
that 
imprint 
of 
newness 
found 
in 
the 
households 
of 
the 
newly 
married.
Halfway 
through 
supper 
Prince 
Andrew 
leaned 
his 
elbows 
on 
the 
table 
and,
with 
a 
look 
of 
nervous 
agitation 
such 
as 
Pierre 
had 
never 
before 
seen 
on
his 
face, 
began 
to 
talk-as 
one 
who 
has 
long<p>
had 
something 
on 
his 
mind
and 
suddenly 
determines 
to 
speak 
out.

"Never, 
never 
marry, 
my 
dear 
fellow! 
That's 
my 
advice: 
never 
marry
till 
you 
can 
say 
to 
yourself 
that 
you 
have 
done 
all 
you 
are 
capable 
of,
and 
until 
you 
have 
ceased 
to 
love 
the 
woman 
of 
your 
choice 
and 
have 
seen
her 
plainly 
as 
she 
is, 
or 
else 
you 
will 
make 
a 
cruel 
and 
irrevocable
mistake. 
Marry 
when 
you 
are 
old 
and 
good 
for
