slightly
thrown 
back. 
His 
whole 
short 
corpulent 
figure 
with 
broad 
thick
shoulders, 
and 
chest 
and 
stomach 
involuntarily 
protruding, 
had 
that
imposing 
and 
stately 
appearance 
one 
sees 
in 
men 
<a href="/aVzUge/iO7a8G9LgATt.html">of</a> 
forty 
who 
<a href="/cZl/KD5oL5uq7hyP.html">live</a> 
in
comfort. 
It 
was 
evident, 
too, 
that 
he 
was 
in 
the 
best 
of 
spirits 
that
day.

He 
nodded 
in 
answer 
to 
Balashev's 
low 
and<p>
respectful 
bow, 
and 
coming 
up
to 
him 
at 
once 
began 
speaking 
like 
a 
man 
who 
values 
every 
moment 
of 
his
time 
and 
does 
not 
condescend 
to 
prepare 
what 
he 
has 
to 
say 
but 
is 
sure
he 
will 
always 
say 
the 
right 
thing 
and 
say 
it 
well.

"Good 
day, 
General!" 
said 
he. 
"I 
have 
received 
the 
letter 
you 
brought
from 
the 
Emperor 
Alexander 
and 
am 
very 
glad 
to 
see 
you." 
He 
glanced 
with
his 
large 
eyes 
into 
Balashev's 
face 
and 
immediately 
looked 
past 
him.

It 
was 
plain 
that 
Balashev's 
personality 
did 
not 
interest 
him 
at 
all.
Evidently 
only 
what 
took 
place 
within 
his 
own 
mind 
interested 
him.
Nothing 
outside 
himself 
had 
any 
significance 
for 
him, 
because 
everything
in 
the 
world, 
it 
seemed 
to 
him, 
depended 
entirely 
on 
his 
will.

"I 
do 
not, 
and 
did 
not, 
desire 
war," 
he 
continued, 
"but 
it 
has 
been
forced 
on 
me. 
Even 
now" 
(he 
emphasized 
the 
word) 
"I 
am 
ready 
to 
receive
any 
explanations 
you 
can 
give 
me."

And 
he 
began 
clearly 
and 
concisely 
to 
explain 
his 
reasons 
for
dissatisfaction
