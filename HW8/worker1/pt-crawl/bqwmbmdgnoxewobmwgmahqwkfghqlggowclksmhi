that 
Bonaparte 
was 
an 
insignificant
little 
Frenchy, 
successful 
only 
because 
there 
were 
no 
longer 
any
Potemkins 
or 
Suvorovs 
left 
to 
oppose 
him; 
but 
he 
was 
also 
convinced
that 
there 
were 
no 
political 
difficulties

Europe 
and 
no 
real 
war,

only 
a

puppet 
show 
at 
which 
the 
men 
of 
the 
day 
were 
playing,
pretending 
to 
do 
something 
real. 
Prince 
Andrew 
gaily 
bore 
with 
his
father's 
ridicule 
of 
the 
new 
men, 
and 
drew 
him 
on 
and 
listened 
to 
him
with 
evident 
pleasure.

"The 
past 
always 
seems 
good," 
said 
he, 
"but 
did 
not 
Suvorov
himself 
fall 
into 
a 
trap 
Moreau 
set 
him, 
and 
from 
which 
he 
did 
not 
know
how 
to 
escape?"

"Who 
told 
you 
that? 
Who?" 
cried 
the 
prince. 
"Suvorov!" 
And 
he
jerked 
away 
his 
plate, 
which 
Tikhon 
briskly 
caught. 
"Suvorov!...
Consider, 
Prince 
Andrew. 
Two... 
Frederick 
and 
Suvorov; 
Moreau!...
Moreau 
would 
have 
been 
a 
prisoner 
if 
Suvorov 
had 
had 
a 
free 
hand; 
but
he 
had 
the 
Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath 
on 
his 
hands.
