The</a> 
French, 
who 
had 
ceased 
firing 
at 
this 
field 
strewn 
with 
dead 
and
wounded 
where 
there 
was 
no 
one 
left 
to 
fire 
at, 
on 
seeing 
an 
adjutant
riding 
over 
it 
trained 
a 
gun 
on 
him 
and 
fired 
several 
shots. 
The
sensation 
of 
those 
terrible 
whistling 
sounds 
and 
of 
the 
corpses<p>
around
him 
merged 
in 
Rostov's 
mind 
into 
a 
single 
feeling 
of 
terror 
and 
pity
for 
himself. 
He 
remembered 
his 
mother's 
last 
letter. 
"What 
would 
she
feel," 
thought 
he, 
"if 
she 
saw 
me 
here 
now 
on 
this 
field 
with 
the
cannon 
aimed 
at 
me?"

In 
the 
village<p>
of 
Hosjeradek 
there 
were 
Russian 
troops 
retiring 
from
the 
field 
of 
battle, 
who 
though 
still 
in 
some 
confusion 
were 
less
disordered. 
The 
French 
cannon 
did 
not 
reach 
there 
and 
the 
musketry 
fire
sounded 
far 
away. 
Here 
everyone 
clearly 
saw 
and 
said 
that 
the 
battle
was 
lost. 
No 
one 
whom 
Rostov 
asked 
could 
tell 
him 
where 
the 
Emperor
or 
Kutuzov 
was. 
Some 
said 
the 
report 
that 
the 
Emperor 
was 
wounded 
was
correct, 
others 
that 
it 
was 
not, 
and 
explained 
the 
false 
rumor 
that 
had
spread 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Emperor's 
carriage 
had 
really 
galloped
from 
the 
field 
of 
battle 
with 
the 
pale 
and 
terrified 
Ober-Hofmarschal
Count 
Tolstoy, 
who 
had 
ridden 
out 
to 
the 
battlefield 
with 
others 
in
the 
Emperor's 
suite.
