the
greater 
part 
of 
the 
enemy's 
opened 
out 
from 
this 
battery. 
Just 
facing
it, 
on 
the 
crest 
of 
the 
opposite 
hill,<p>
the 
village 
of 
Schoen 
Grabern
could 
be 
seen, 
<a href="/cZl/xp64rJpLp5.html">and</a> 
in<p>
three 
places 
to 
left 
and 
right 
the 
French 
troops
amid 
the 
smoke 
of 
their 
campfires, 
the 
greater 
part 
of 
whom 
were
evidently 
in 
the 
village 
itself 
and 
behind 
the 
hill. 
To 
the 
left 
from
that 
village, 
amid 
the 
smoke, 
was 
something 
resembling 
a 
battery, 
but 
<a href="/cZl/Uy6yuV92tQp.html">it
was</a> 
impossible 
to 
see 
it 
clearly 
with 
the 
naked

Our 
right 
flank 
was
posted 
<a href="/cZl/PK5ZUI0EXJo9ON.html">on</a> 
a 
rather 
steep 
incline 
which 
dominated 
the 
French 
position.
Our 
infantry 
were 
stationed 
there, 
and 
at 
the 
farthest 
point 
the
dragoons. 
In 
the 
center, 
where 
Tushin's 
battery 
stood 
and 
from 
which
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
surveying 
the 
position, 
was 
the 
easiest 
and 
most
direct 
descent 
and 
ascent 
to 
the 
brook 
separating 
us 
from 
Schoen
Grabern. 
On 
the<p>
left 
our 
troops 
were 
close 
to 
a 
copse, 
in 
which 
smoked
the 
bonfires 
of 
our 
infantry 
who 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hH2LZ1ahj0Ikp.html">were</a> 
felling 
wood. 
The 
French 
line 
was
wider 
than 
ours, 
and 
it 
was 
plain 
that 
they 
could 
easily 
outflank 
us
on 
both 
sides. 
Behind 
our 
position 
was 
a 
steep 
and 
deep 
dip, 
making 
it
difficult 
for 
artillery 
and 
cavalry 
to 
retire. 
Prince 
Andrew 
took
out 
his 
notebook
