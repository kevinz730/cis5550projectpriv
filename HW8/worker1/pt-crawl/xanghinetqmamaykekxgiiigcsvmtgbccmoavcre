to 
the
idea.

Little 
Nicholas 
and 
his 
education, 
her 
brother 
Andrew, 
and 
religion
were 
Princess 
Mary's 
joys 
and 
consolations; 
but 
besides 
that, 
since
everyone 
must 
have 
personal 
hopes, 
Princess 
Mary 
in 
the 
profoundest
depths 
of 
her 
heart 
had 
a 
hidden 
dream 
and 
hope 
that 
supplied 
the 
chief
consolation 
of 
her 
life. 
This 
comforting 
dream 
and 
hope 
were 
given 
her
by 
God's 
folk-the 
half-witted<p>
and 
other 
pilgrims 
who 
visited
her 
without 
the 
prince's 
knowledge. 
The 
longer 
she 
lived, 
the 
more
experience 
and 
observation 
she 
had 
of 
life, 
the 
greater 
was 
her 
wonder
at 
the 
short-sightedness 
of 
men 
who 
seek 
enjoyment 
and 
happiness 
here
on 
earth: 
toiling, 
suffering, 
struggling, 
and 
harming 
one 
another, 
to
obtain 
that 
impossible, 
visionary, 
sinful 
happiness. 
Prince 
Andrew 
had
loved 
his 
wife, 
she 
died, 
but 
that 
was 
not 
enough: 
he 
wanted 
to 
bind
his 
happiness 
to 
another 
woman. 
Her 
father 
objected 
to 
this 
because 
he
wanted 
a 
more 
distinguished 
and 
wealthier 
match 
for 
Andrew. 
And 
they
all 
struggled 
and 
suffered 
and 
tormented 
one 
another 
and 
injured 
their
souls, 
their 
eternal 
souls, 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
benefits 
which 
endure
but 
for<p>
an 
instant. 
Not 
only 
do 
we 
know 
this 
ourselves, 
but 
Christ, 
the
Son 
of 
God, 
came 
down 
to 
earth 
and 
told 
us 
that 
this 
life 
is 
but 
for
a 
moment 
and 
is 
a 
probation; 
yet 
we 
cling 
to 
it 
and 
think 
to 
find
happiness 
in 
it. 
"How 
is 
it 
that 
no 
one 
realizes 
this?" 
thought
Princess 
Mary. 
"No 
one 
except 
these 
despised 
God's 
folk 
who, 
wallet
on 
back, 
come 
to 
me 
by 
the 
back 
door, 
afraid 
of 
being 
seen 
by 
the
prince, 
not 
for 
fear 
of 
ill-usage 
by<p>
him 
but 
for 
fear 
of 
causing 
him
to 
sin. 
To 
leave 
family, 
home, 
and 
all 
the 
cares 
of 
worldly 
welfare, 
in
order 
without 
clinging 
to 
anything 
to 
wander 
in 
hempen 
rags 
from 
place
to 
place 
under 
an 
assumed 
name, 
doing 
no 
one 
any 
harm 
but 
praying 
for
all-for 
those 
who 
drive 
one 
away 
as 
well 
as 
for 
those 
who 
protect 
one:
higher 
than 
that<p>
life 
and 
truth 
there 
is 
no 
life 
or 
truth!"
