of 
the</h1>forest 
into 
the
bright 
firelight 
stepped 
two 
strangely 
clad<p>
human 
figures 
clinging 
to
one 
another.

These 
were 
two 
Frenchmen 
who 
had 
been 
hiding 
in 
the 
forest. 
They 
came 
up
to 
the 
fire, 
hoarsely 
uttering 
something 
in 
a 
language 
our 
soldiers 
did
not 
understand. 
One 
was 
taller 
than 
the 
other; 
he 
wore 
an 
officer's 
hat
and 
seemed 
quite 
exhausted. 
On 
approaching 
the 
fire 
he 
had 
been 
going 
to
sit 
down, 
but 
fell. 
The 
other, 
a 
short 
sturdy 
soldier 
with 
a 
shawl
tied 
round 
his 
head, 
was 
stronger. 
He 
raised 
his<p>
companion<p>
and 
said
something, 
pointing 
to 
his 
mouth. 
The 
soldiers 
surrounded 
the 
Frenchmen,
spread 
a 
greatcoat 
on 
the 
ground 
for 
the 
sick 
man, 
and 
brought 
some
buckwheat 
porridge 
and 
vodka 
for 
both 
of 
them.

The 
exhausted 
French 
officer 
was 
Ramballe 
and 
the 
man 
with 
his 
head
wrapped 
in 
the 
shawl 
was 
Morel, 
his 
orderly.

When 
Morel 
had 
drunk 
some 
vodka 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/gJL2AgW2UGRY0uIRD.html">finished</a> 
his 
bowl 
of 
porridge 
he
suddenly 
became 
unnaturally 
merry 
and 
chattered 
incessantly 
to 
the
soldiers, 
who 
could 
not 
understand 
him. 
Ramballe 
refused 
food 
<a href="/cZl/PK8tHLaX8sfA3mTUVM.html">and
resting</a> 
his 
head 
on 
his 
elbow 
lay 
silent 
beside 
the 
campfire, 
looking<p>
at
the 
Russian 
soldiers 
with 
red 
and 
vacant 
eyes. 
Occasionally 
he 
emitted
a 
long-drawn 
groan 
and 
then 
again 
became 
silent. 
Morel, 
pointing 
to 
his
shoulders, 
tried 
to 
impress 
on 
the 
soldiers 
the 
fact 
that 
Ramballe 
was
an 
officer 
and 
ought 
to 
be 
warmed. 
A 
Russian 
officer 
who 
had 
come 
up
to 
the 
fire 
sent 
to 
ask 
his 
colonel 
whether 
he 
would 
not 
take 
a 
French
officer 
into 
his 
hut 
to 
warm 
him, 
and 
when 
the 
messenger 
returned 
and
said 
that 
the 
colonel 
wished 
the 
officer 
to 
be 
brought 
to 
him, 
Ramballe
was 
told 
to 
go. 
He 
rose 
and 
tried 
to 
walk, 
but 
staggered 
and 
would 
have
fallen 
had 
not 
a 
soldier 
standing 
by 
held 
him 
up.

"You 
won't 
do 
it 
again, 
eh?" 
said 
one 
of 
the 
soldiers, 
winking 
and
turning 
mockingly 
to 
Ramballe.

"Oh, 
you 
fool! 
Why 
talk 
rubbish, 
lout 
that 
you 
are-a 
real 
peasant!" 
came
rebukes 
from 
all 
sides 
addressed 
to 
the 
jesting 
soldier.

They 
surrounded 
Ramballe, 
lifted 
him 
on 
the 
crossed 
arms 
of 
two
soldiers, 
and 
carried 
him 
to 
the 
hut. 
Ramballe 
put 
his 
arms 
around 
their
necks 
while 
they 
carried 
him 
and 
began 
wailing 
plaintively:

"Oh, 
you<p>
fine 
fellows, 
my 
kind, 
kind 
friends! 
These 
are 
men! 
Oh, 
my
brave, 
kind 
friends," 
and 
he 
leaned 
his 
head 
against 
the 
shoulder 
of 
one
of 
the 
men 
like 
a 
child.

Meanwhile 
Morel 
was 
sitting 
in 
the 
best 
place 
by 
the 
fire, 
surrounded 
by
the 
soldiers.

Morel, 
a 
short 
sturdy 
Frenchman 
with 
inflamed 
and 
streaming 
eyes, 
was
wearing 
a 
woman's 
cloak 
and 
had 
a 
shawl 
tied 
woman<p>
fashion 
round 
his
head 
over 
his 
cap. 
He 
was 
evidently 
tipsy, 
and 
was 
singing 
a 
French 
song
in 
a 
hoarse 
broken 
voice, 
with 
an 
arm 
thrown 
round 
the 
nearest 
soldier.
The 
soldiers 
simply 
held 
their 
sides 
as 
they 
watched 
him.

"Now 
then, 
now 
then, 
teach 
us 
how 
it 
goes! 
I'll 
soon 
pick 
it 
up. 
How 
is
it?" 
said 
the 
man-a 
singer 
and 
a 
wag-whom 
Morel 
was 
embracing.

"Vive 
Henri 
Quatre! 
Vive 
ce 
roi 
valiant!" 
sang 
Morel, 
winking. 
"Ce
diable 
a 
quatre..." 
*

 
 
 
 
 
* 
"Long 
live 
Henry 
the 
Fourth, 
that 
valiant 
king! 
That 
rowdy
 
 
 
 
 
devil."


"Vivarika! 
Vif-seruvaru! 
Sedyablyaka!" 
repeated 
the 
soldier, 
flourishing
his 
arm 
and 
really 
catching 
the 
tune.

"Bravo! 
Ha, 
ha, 
ha!" 
rose 
their 
rough, 
joyous 
laughter 
from 
all
