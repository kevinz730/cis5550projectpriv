The 
hunt 
servants
fell 
into 
line. 
The 
masters 
rode 
together. 
"Uncle," 
Rostov, 
and
Ilagin 
kept 
stealthily 
glancing 
at 
one 
another's 
dogs, 
trying 
not
to 
be 
observed 
by 
their 
companions 
and 
searching 
uneasily 
for 
rivals 
to
their 
own 
borzois.

Rostov 
was 
particularly 
struck 
by 
the 
beauty 
of 
a<p>
small, 
pure-bred,
red-spotted 
bitch 
on 
Ilagin's 
leash, 
slender 
but 
with 
muscles 
like
steel, 
a 
delicate 
muzzle, 
and 
prominent 
black 
eyes. 
He 
had 
heard 
of
the<p>
swiftness 
of 
Ilagin's 
borzois, 
and 
in 
that 
beautiful 
bitch 
saw 
a
rival 
to 
his 
own 
Milka.

In 
the 
middle 
of 
a 
sober 
conversation 
begun 
by 
Ilagin 
about 
the
year's 
harvest, 
Nicholas 
pointed 
to 
the 
red-spotted 
bitch.

"A 
fine 
little 
bitch, 
that!" 
said 
he 
in 
a 
careless 
tone. 
"Is 
she
swift?"

"That 
one? 
Yes, 
she's 
a 
good 
dog, 
gets 
what 
she's 
after,"
answered 
Ilagin 
indifferently, 
of 
the 
red-spotted 
bitch 
Erza, 
for
which, 
a 
year 
before, 
he 
had 
given 
a 
neighbor 
three 
families 
of 
house
serfs. 
"So 
in 
your 
parts, 
too, 
the 
harvest 
is 
nothing 
to 
boast 
of,
Count?" 
he 
went 
on, 
continuing 
the 
conversation 
they 
had 
begun. 
And
considering 
it 
polite 
to 
return 
the 
young 
count's 
compliment, 
Ilagin
looked 
at 
his 
borzois 
and 
picked 
out 
Milka 
who 
attracted 
his 
attention
by 
her 
breadth. 
"That 
black-spotted 
one 
of 
yours 
is 
fine-well
shaped!" 
said 
he.

"Yes, 
she's 
fast 
enough," 
replied 
Nicholas, 
and 
thought: 
"If
only 
a 
full-grown 
hare 
would 
cross 
the 
field 
now 
I'd 
show 
you 
what
sort 
of 
borzoi 
she 
is," 
and 
turning 
to 
his 
groom, 
he 
said 
he 
would
give 
a 
ruble 
to 
anyone 
who 
found 
a 
hare.

"I 
don't 
understand," 
continued 
Ilagin, 
"how 
some 
sportsmen 
can
be 
so 
jealous 
about 
game 
and 
dogs. 
For 
myself, 
I 
can 
tell 
you, 
Count,
I<p>
enjoy 
riding 
in 
company 
such 
as 
this... 
what 
could 
be 
better?" 
(he
again 
raised 
his 
cap 
to 
Natasha) 
"but 
as 
for 
counting 
skins 
and 
what
one 
takes, 
I 
don't 
care 
about 
that."

"Of 
course 
not!"

"Or 
being 
upset 
because 
someone 
else's 
borzoi 
and 
not 
mine 
catches
something. 
All 
I 
care 
about 
is 
to 
enjoy 
seeing 
the 
chase, 
is 
it 
not 
so,
Count? 
For 
I 
consider 
that..."

"A-tu!" 
came 
the 
long-drawn 
cry 
of 
one 
of 
the 
borzoi 
whippers-in,
who 
had 
halted. 
He 
stood 
on 
a 
knoll 
in 
the 
stubble, 
holding 
his 
whip
aloft, 
and 
again 
repeated 
his 
long-drawn 
cry, 
"A-tu!" 
(This 
call 
and
the 
uplifted 
whip 
meant 
that 
he 
saw 
a 
sitting 
hare.)

"Ah, 
he 
has 
found 
one, 
I 
think," 
said 
Ilagin 
carelessly. 
"Yes, 
we
must 
ride 
up.... 
Shall 
we 
both 
course 
it?" 
answered 
Nicholas, 
seeing
in 
Erza 
and 
"Uncle's" 
red 
Rugay 
two 
rivals 
<a href="/aVzUge/Uy7tHdfO66kZt.html">he</a> 
had 
never 
yet 
had
a 
chance 
of 
pitting 
against<p>
his 
own 
borzois. 
"And 
suppose 
they 
outdo
my 
Milka 
at 
once!" 
he 
thought 
as 
he 
rode 
with 
"Uncle" 
and 
Ilagin
toward 
the 
hare.

"A 
full-grown 
one?"<p>
asked 
Ilagin 
as 
he 
approached 
the 
whip 
who
had 
sighted 
the 
hare-and 
not 
without 
agitation 
he 
looked 
round 
and
whistled 
to 
Erza.

"And 
you, 
Michael 
Nikanorovich?" 
he 
said, 
addressing 
"Uncle."

The 
latter 
was 
riding 
with 
a 
sullen 
expression 
on 
his 
face.

"How 
can 
I 
join 
in? 
Why, 
you've 
given 
a 
village 
for 
each 
of 
your
borzois! 
That's 
it, 
come 
on! 
Yours 
are 
worth 
thousands. 
Try 
yours
against 
one 
another, 
you 
two, 
and 
I'll 
look 
on!"

"Rugay, 
hey, 
hey!" 
he 
shouted. 
"Rugayushka!" 
he 
added,
involuntarily 
by 
this 
diminutive 
expressing 
his 
affection 
and 
the 
hopes
he 
placed 
on 
this 
red 
borzoi. 
Natasha 
saw 
and 
felt 
the 
agitation 
the
two 
elderly 
men 
and 
her 
brother 
were 
trying 
to 
conceal, 
and 
was 
herself
excited 
by 
it.

The 
huntsman 
stood 
halfway 
up 
the 
knoll 
holding 
up 
his 
whip 
and 
the
gentlefolk 
rode
