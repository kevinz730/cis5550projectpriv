him, 
trying 
not 
to</h1>be 
overheard, 
and 
that 
all 
through
dinner 
she 
was 
more 
agitated 
than 
ever. 
When 
they 
got 
home 
Natasha 
was
the 
first 
to 
begin 
the 
explanation 
Sonya 
expected.

"There, 
Sonya, 
you 
were 
talking 
all 
sorts 
of 
nonsense 
about 
him,"
Natasha 
began 
in 
a 
mild 
voice 
such 
as 
children 
use 
when 
they 
wish 
to 
be
praised. 
"We 
have 
had 
an 
explanation 
today."

"Well, 
what 
happened? 
What 
did 
he 
say? 
Natasha, 
how 
glad 
I 
am
you're 
not 
angry 
with 
me! 
Tell 
me 
everything-the 
whole 
truth. 
What
did 
he 
say?"

Natasha 
became 
thoughtful.

"Oh, 
Sonya, 
if 
you 
knew 
him 
as 
I 
do! 
He 
said... 
He 
asked 
me 
what 
I
had 
promised 
Bolkonski. 
He 
was 
glad 
I 
was 
free 
to 
refuse 
him."

Sonya 
sighed 
sorrowfully.

"But 
you 
haven't 
refused 
Bolkonski?" 
said 
she.

"Perhaps 
I 
have. 
Perhaps 
all 
is 
over 
between 
me 
and 
Bolkonski. 
Why 
do
you 
think 
so 
badly 
of 
me?"

"I 
don't 
think 
anything, 
only 
I 
don't 
understand 
this..."

"Wait 
a 
bit, 
Sonya, 
you'll 
understand 
<a href="/aVzUge/zl7Dj1WG1yxat.html">everything.</a> 
You'll 
see 
what
a 
man 
he 
is! 
Now 
don't 
think 
badly 
of 
me 
or 
of 
him. 
I 
don't 
think
badly 
of 
anyone: 
I 
love 
and 
pity 
everybody. 
But 
what 
am 
I 
to 
do?"

Sonya 
did 
not 
succumb 
to 
the 
tender 
tone 
Natasha 
used 
toward 
her.
The 
more 
emotional 
and 
ingratiating 
the 
expression 
of 
Natasha's 
face
became, 
the 
more 
serious 
and 
stern 
grew 
Sonya's.

"Natasha," 
said 
she, 
"you 
asked 
me 
not 
to 
speak 
to 
you, 
and 
I
haven't 
spoken, 
but 
now 
you 
yourself 
have 
begun. 
I 
don't 
trust 
him,
Natasha. 
Why 
this 
secrecy?"

"Again, 
again!" 
interrupted 
Natasha.

"Natasha, 
I 
am 
afraid 
for 
you!"

"Afraid 
of 
what?"

"I 
am 
afraid 
you're 
going 
to 
your 
ruin," 
said 
Sonya 
resolutely,
and 
was 
herself 
horrified 
at 
what 
she 
had 
said.

Anger 
again 
showed 
in 
Natasha's 
face.

"And 
I'll 
go 
to 
my 
ruin, 
I 
will, 
as 
soon 
as 
possible! 
It's 
not
your 
business! 
It 
won't 
be 
you, 
but 
I, 
who'll 
suffer. 
Leave 
me
alone, 
leave 
me 
alone! 
I 
hate 
you!"

"Natasha!" 
moaned 
Sonya, 
aghast.

"I 
hate 
you, 
I 
hate 
you! 
You're 
my 
enemy 
forever!" 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ox4Nec7rqw2XZEHJ.html">And</a> 
Natasha
ran 
out 
of 
the 
room.

Natasha 
did 
not 
speak 
to 
Sonya 
again 
and 
avoided 
her. 
With 
the 
same
expression 
of 
agitated 
surprise 
and 
guilt 
she 
went 
about 
the 
house,
taking 
up 
now 
one 
occupation, 
now 
another, 
and 
at 
once 
abandoning 
them.

Hard 
as 
it 
was 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EP5v7XHd9mfcn.html">for</a> 
Sonya, 
she 
watched 
her 
friend 
and 
did 
not 
let 
her
out 
of 
her 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bKM43alHv0.html">sight.

The</a> 
day 
before 
the 
count 
was 
to 
return, 
Sonya 
noticed 
that 
Natasha 
sat
by 
the 
drawing 
room 
window 
all 
the 
morning 
as 
if 
expecting 
something 
and
that 
she 
made 
a 
sign 
to 
an 
officer 
who 
drove 
past, 
whom 
Sonya 
took 
to
be 
Anatole.

Sonya 
began 
watching 
her 
friend 
still 
more 
attentively 
and 
noticed 
that
at 
dinner 
and 
all 
that 
evening 
Natasha 
was 
in 
a 
strange 
and<p>
unnatural
state. 
She 
answered 
questions 
at 
random, 
began 
sentences 
she 
did 
not
finish, 
and 
laughed 
at
