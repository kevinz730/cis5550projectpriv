with 
him, 
but 
in 
1811 
they 
again 
quarreled 
and 
again 
began 
killing 
many
people. 
Napoleon 
led 
six 
hundred 
thousand 
men 
into 
Russia<p>
and 
captured
Moscow; 
then 
he 
suddenly 
ran 
away 
from 
Moscow, 
and 
the 
Emperor
Alexander, 
helped 
by 
the 
advice 
of 
Stein 
and 
others, 
united 
Europe 
to
arm 
against 
the 
disturber 
of 
its 
peace. 
All 
Napoleon's 
allies 
suddenly
became 
his 
enemies 
and 
their 
forces 
advanced 
against 
the 
fresh 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/HB95NtgpO1Xs.html">forces</a> 
he
raised. 
The 
Allies 
defeated 
Napoleon, 
entered 
<a href="/cZl/mN8FX5mN2.html">Paris,</a> 
forced 
Napoleon 
to
abdicate, 
and 
sent 
him 
to 
the 
island 
of 
Elba, 
not 
depriving 
him 
of 
the
title 
of 
Emperor 
and 
showing 
him 
every 
respect, 
though 
five 
years<p>
before
and 
one 
year 
later 
they 
all 
regarded 
him 
as 
an 
outlaw 
and 
a 
brigand.
Then 
Louis 
XVIII, 
who 
till 
then 
had 
been 
the 
laughingstock 
both 
of 
the
French 
and 
the 
Allies, 
began 
to 
reign. 
And 
Napoleon, 
shedding 
tears
before 
his 
Old 
Guards, 
renounced 
the 
throne 
and 
went 
into 
exile. 
Then
the 
skillful 
statesmen 
and 
diplomatists 
(especially 
Talleyrand, 
who
managed 
to 
sit 
down 
in 
a 
particular 
chair 
before 
anyone 
else 
and
thereby 
extended 
the 
frontiers 
of 
France) 
talked 
in 
Vienna 
and 
by
these 
conversations 
made 
the 
nations 
happy 
or 
unhappy. 
Suddenly 
the
diplomatists 
and 
monarchs 
nearly 
quarreled 
and 
were 
on 
the 
point 
of
again 
ordering 
their 
armies 
to 
kill 
one 
another, 
but 
just 
then 
Napoleon
arrived 
in 
France 
with 
a 
battalion, 
and 
the 
French, 
who 
had 
been 
hating
him, 
immediately 
all 
submitted 
to 
him. 
But 
the 
Allied 
monarchs 
were
angry 
at 
this 
and 
went 
to 
fight 
the 
French 
once 
more. 
And 
they 
defeated
the 
genius 
Napoleon 
and, 
suddenly 
recognizing 
him 
as 
a 
brigand, 
sent 
him
to 
the 
island 
of 
St. 
Helena.
