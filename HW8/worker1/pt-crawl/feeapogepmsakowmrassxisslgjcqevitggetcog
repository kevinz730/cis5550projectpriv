seething 
in 
its 
depths. 
Historic 
figures 
were 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ze3mAz2gcFtr.html">not
borne</a> 
by 
the 
waves 
from 
one 
shore 
to 
another 
as 
before. 
They 
now 
seemed
to 
rotate 
on 
one 
spot. 
The 
historical 
figures 
at 
the 
head 
of 
armies,
who 
formerly 
reflected 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
masses 
by 
ordering 
wars,
campaigns, 
and 
battles, 
now 
reflected 
the 
restless 
movement 
by 
political
and 
diplomatic 
combinations, 
laws, 
and 
treaties.

The 
historians 
call 
this 
activity 
of 
the 
historical 
figures 
"the
reaction."

In 
dealing 
with 
this 
period 
they 
sternly 
condemn 
the 
historical
personages 
who, 
in 
their 
opinion, 
caused 
what 
they 
describe 
as 
the
reaction. 
All 
the 
well-known 
people 
of<p>
that 
period, 
from 
Alexander 
and
Napoleon 
to 
Madame 
de 
Stael, 
Photius, 
Schelling, 
Fichte, 
Chateaubriand,
and 
the 
rest, 
pass 
before 
their 
stern 
judgment 
seat 
and 
are 
acquitted 
or
condemned 
according 
to 
whether 
they 
conduced 
to 
progress 
or 
to 
reaction.

According 
to 
their 
accounts 
a 
reaction 
took 
place 
at 
that 
time 
in 
Russia
also, 
and 
the 
chief 
culprit 
was 
Alexander 
I, 
the 
same 
man 
who 
according
to 
them 
was 
the 
chief 
cause 
of 
the 
liberal 
movement 
at 
the 
commencement
of 
his 
reign, 
being 
the 
savior 
of 
Russia.

There 
is 
no 
one 
in 
Russian 
literature 
now, 
from 
schoolboy 
essayist 
to
learned 
historian, 
who 
does 
not 
throw 
his 
little 
stone 
at 
Alexander 
for
things 
he 
did 
wrong 
at 
this 
period 
of 
his 
reign.

"He 
ought 
to 
have 
acted 
in 
this 
way 
and 
in 
that 
way. 
In 
this 
case 
he 
did
well 
and 
in 
that 
case 
badly. 
He 
behaved 
admirably 
at 
the 
beginning 
of
his 
reign 
and 
during 
1812, 
but 
acted 
badly 
by 
giving 
a 
constitution
to 
Poland, 
forming 
the 
Holy 
Alliance, 
entrusting 
power 
to 
Arakcheev,
favoring 
Golitsyn 
and 
mysticism, 
and 
afterwards 
<a href="/aVzUge/LE260zSr.html">Shishkov</a> 
and 
Photius.
He 
also 
acted 
badly 
by 
concerning 
himself 
with 
the 
active 
army 
and
disbanding 
the 
Semenov 
regiment."
