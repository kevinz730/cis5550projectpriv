are

Andrew 
did 
not 
tell 
his 
father 
that 
he 
would 
no 
doubt<p>
live 
a 
long 
time
yet. 
He 
felt 
that 
he 
must 
not 
say 
it.

"I 
will 
do 
it 
all, 
Father," 
he 
said.

"Well, 
now, 
good-by!" 
He 
gave 
his 
son 
his 
hand 
to 
kiss, 
and 
embraced
him. 
"Remember 
this, 
Prince 
Andrew, 
if 
they 
kill 
you 
it 
will 
hurt 
me,
your 
old 
father..." 
he 
paused 
unexpectedly, 
and 
then 
in 
a 
querulous
voice 
suddenly 
shrieked: 
"but 
if 
I 
hear 
that 
you 
have 
not 
behaved 
like
a 
son 
of 
Nicholas 
Bolkonski, 
I 
shall 
be 
ashamed!"

"You 
need 
not 
have 
said 
that 
to 
me, 
Father," 
said 
the 
son 
with 
a
smile.

The 
old 
man 
was 
silent.

"I 
also 
wanted 
to 
ask 
you," 
continued 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"if 
I'm
killed 
and 
if 
I 
have 
a 
son, 
do 
not 
let 
him 
be 
taken 
away 
from 
you-as 
I
said 
yesterday... 
let 
him 
grow 
up 
with 
you.... 
Please."

"Not 
let 
the 
wife 
have<p>
him?" 
said 
the 
old 
man, 
and 
laughed.

They 
stood 
silent, 
facing 
one 
another. 
The 
old 
man's 
sharp 
eyes 
were
fixed 
straight 
on 
his 
son's. 
Something 
twitched 
in 
the 
lower 
part 
of
the 
old 
prince's 
face.

"We've 
said 
good-by. 
Go!" 
he 
suddenly 
shouted 
in 
a 
loud, 
angry
voice, 
opening 
his 
door.

"What 
is 
it? 
What?" 
asked 
both 
princesses 
when 
they 
saw 
for 
a 
moment
at 
the 
door 
Prince 
Andrew 
and 
the 
figure 
of 
the 
old 
man 
in 
a 
white
dressing 
gown, 
spectacled 
and 
wigless, 
shouting 
in 
an 
angry 
voice.

Prince 
Andrew 
sighed 
and 
made 
no 
reply.

"Well!" 
he<p>
said, 
turning 
to 
his 
wife.

And 
this 
"Well!" 
sounded<p>
coldly 
ironic, 
as 
if 
he 
were 
saying: 
"Now
go 
through 
your 
performance."

"Andrew, 
already!" 
said 
the 
little 
princess, 
turning 
pale 
and
looking 
with 
dismay 
at 
her 
husband.

He 
embraced 
her. 
She 
screamed 
and 
fell 
unconscious 
on 
his 
shoulder.

He 
cautiously 
released 
the 
shoulder 
she 
leaned 
on, 
looked 
into 
her 
face,
and 
carefully 
placed 
her 
in 
an 
easy 
chair.

"Adieu, 
Mary," 
said 
he 
gently 
to 
his 
sister, 
taking 
her 
by 
the 
hand
and 
kissing 
her, 
and 
then 
he 
left 
the 
room 
with 
rapid 
steps.

The 
little 
princess 
lay 
in 
the 
armchair, 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
chafing
her 
temples. 
Princess 
Mary, 
supporting 
her 
sister-in-law, 
still 
looked
with 
her 
beautiful 
eyes 
full 
of 
tears 
at 
the 
door 
through 
which 
Prince
Andrew 
had 
gone 
and 
made 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
cross 
in 
his 
direction. 
From
the 
study, 
like 
pistol 
shots, 
came 
the 
frequent 
sound 
of 
the 
old 
man
angrily 
blowing 
his 
nose. 
Hardly 
had 
Prince 
Andrew 
gone 
when 
the 
study
door 
opened 
quickly 
and 
the 
stern 
figure 
of 
the 
old 
man 
in 
the 
white
dressing 
gown 
looked 
out.

"Gone? 
That's 
all 
right!" 
said 
he; 
and 
looking 
angrily 
at 
the
unconscious 
little 
princess, 
he 
shook 
his 
head 
reprovingly 
and 
slammed
the 
door.





BOOK 
TWO: 
1805





CHAPTER 
I

In 
October, 
1805, 
a 
Russian 
army 
was 
occupying 
the 
villages 
and 
towns 
of
the 
Archduchy 
of 
Austria, 
and 
yet 
other 
regiments 
freshly 
arriving 
from
Russia 
were 
settling 
near 
the 
fortress 
of 
Braunau 
and 
burdening 
the
inhabitants 
on 
whom 
they 
were 
quartered. 
Braunau 
was 
the 
headquarters 
of
the 
commander 
in 
chief, 
Kutuzov.

On 
October 
11, 
1805, 
one 
of 
the 
infantry 
regiments 
that 
had 
just 
reached
Braunau 
had 
halted 
half 
a 
mile 
from 
the 
town, 
waiting 
to 
be 
inspected
by 
the 
commander 
in 
chief. 
Despite 
the 
un-Russian 
appearance 
of 
the
locality 
and 
surroundings-fruit 
gardens, 
stone 
fences, 
tiled 
roofs,
and 
hills 
in 
the 
distance-and 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
inhabitants
(who 
gazed 
with 
curiosity 
at 
the 
soldiers) 
were 
not 
Russians, 
<a href="/cZl/Of2bWUL8.html">the
regiment</a> 
had 
just 
the 
appearance 
of 
any 
Russian 
regiment 
preparing 
for
an 
inspection 
anywhere 
in 
the 
heart 
of 
Russia.

On 
the 
evening 
of 
the 
last 
day's 
march 
an 
order 
had 
been 
received 
that
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
would 
inspect 
the 
regiment 
on 
the 
march. 
Though
the 
words 
of 
the 
order 
were 
not 
clear 
to 
the 
regimental 
commander, 
and
the 
question 
arose 
whether 
the 
troops 
were 
to 
be
