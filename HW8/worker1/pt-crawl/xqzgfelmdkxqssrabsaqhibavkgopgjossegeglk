his 
slippers 
and 
his</h1>arms 
into 
the<p>
sleeves 
of 
his 
dressing
gown, 
he 
went 
to 
the 
couch 
on 
which 
he 
slept.

Though 
no 
words 
had 
passed 
between 
Anatole 
and 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne,
they 
quite 
understood 
one 
another 
as 
to 
the 
first 
part 
of 
their 
romance,
up 
to 
the<p>
appearance 
of 
the 
pauvre 
mere; 
they 
understood 
that 
they 
had
much 
to 
say 
to 
one 
another 
in 
private 
and 
so 
they 
had 
been 
seeking 
an
opportunity 
since 
morning 
to 
meet 
one 
another<p>
alone. 
When 
Princess 
Mary
went 
to 
her 
father's 
room 
at 
the 
usual 
hour, 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne
and 
Anatole 
met 
in 
the 
conservatory.

Princess 
Mary 
went 
to 
the 
door 
of 
the 
study 
with 
special 
trepidation.
It 
seemed 
to 
her 
that<p>
not 
only 
did 
everybody 
know 
that 
her 
fate 
would 
be
decided 
that 
day, 
but 
that 
they 
also 
knew 
what 
she 
thought 
about 
it. 
She
read 
this 
in 
Tikhon's 
face 
and 
in 
that 
of 
Prince 
Vasili's 
valet,
who 
made 
her 
a 
low 
bow 
when 
she 
met 
him 
<a href="/cZl/qi6zvJ6ej1tsa.html">in</a> 
the 
corridor 
carrying 
hot
water.

The 
old 
prince 
was 
very<p>
affectionate 
and 
careful 
in 
his 
treatment 
of
his 
daughter 
that 
morning. 
Princess 
Mary 
well 
knew 
this 
painstaking
expression 
of 
her 
father's. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/JM10WMYlo2A.html">His</a> 
face 
wore 
that 
expression 
when 
his
dry 
hands 
clenched 
with 
vexation 
at 
her 
not 
understanding 
a 
sum 
in
arithmetic, 
when 
rising 
from 
his 
chair 
he 
would 
walk 
away 
from 
her,
repeating 
in 
a 
low 
voice 
the 
same 
words 
several 
times 
over.

He 
came 
to 
the 
point 
at<p>
once, 
treating 
her 
ceremoniously.

"I 
have 
had 
a 
proposition 
made 
me 
concerning 
you," 
he 
said 
with 
an
unnatural 
smile. 
"I 
expect 
you 
have 
guessed 
that 
Prince 
Vasili 
has
not 
come 
and 
brought 
his 
pupil 
with 
him" 
(for 
some 
reason 
Prince
Bolkonski 
referred 
to 
Anatole 
as 
a 
"pupil") 
"for 
the 
sake 
of 
my
beautiful 
eyes. 
Last 
night 
a 
proposition 
was 
made 
me 
on 
your 
account
and, 
as 
you 
know 
my 
principles, 
I 
refer 
it 
to 
you."

"How 
am 
I 
to 
understand 
you,
