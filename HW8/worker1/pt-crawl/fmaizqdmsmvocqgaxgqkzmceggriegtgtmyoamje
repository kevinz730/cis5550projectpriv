he 
was</h1>pale 
and 
that 
his 
jaw 
quivered 
and 
shook 
as 
if 
in 
an
ague.

"Ah, 
my 
friend!" 
said 
he, 
taking 
Pierre 
by 
the 
elbow; 
and 
there 
was
in 
his 
voice 
a 
sincerity 
and 
weakness 
Pierre 
had 
never 
observed 
in 
it
before. 
"How 
often 
we 
sin, 
how 
much 
we 
deceive, 
and 
all 
for 
what? 
I 
am
near 
sixty,<p>
dear 
friend... 
I 
too... 
All 
will 
end 
in 
death, 
all! 
Death 
is
awful..." 
and 
he 
burst 
into 
tears.

Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
came 
out 
last. 
She 
approached 
Pierre 
with 
slow, 
quiet
steps.

"Pierre!" 
she 
said.

Pierre 
gave 
her 
an 
inquiring 
look. 
She<p>
kissed 
the<p>
young 
man 
on 
his
forehead, 
wetting 
him 
with 
her 
tears. 
Then 
after 
a 
pause 
she 
said:

"He 
is 
no 
more...."

Pierre 
looked 
at 
her 
over 
his 
spectacles.

"Come, 
I 
will 
go 
with 
you. 
Try 
to 
weep, 
nothing 
gives 
such 
relief 
as
tears."

She 
led 
him 
into 
the 
dark 
drawing 
room 
and 
Pierre 
was 
glad 
no 
one 
could
see 
his 
face. 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
left 
him, 
and 
when 
she 
returned 
he 
was
fast 
asleep 
with 
his 
head 
on 
his 
arm.

In 
the 
morning 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
said 
to 
Pierre:

"Yes, 
my 
dear, 
this 
is 
a 
great 
loss 
for 
us 
all, 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
you.
But 
God 
will 
support 
you: 
you 
are 
young,<p>
and 
are 
now, 
I 
hope, 
in 
command
of 
an 
immense 
fortune. 
The 
will 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
opened. 
I 
know 
you
well 
enough 
to 
be 
sure 
that 
this 
will 
not 
turn 
your 
head, 
but 
it 
imposes
duties 
on 
you, 
and 
you 
must 
be 
a 
man."

Pierre 
was 
silent.

"Perhaps 
later 
on 
I 
may 
tell 
you, 
my 
dear 
boy, 
that 
if 
I 
had 
not 
been
there, 
God 
only 
knows 
what 
would 
have 
happened! 
You 
know, 
Uncle 
promised
me 
only 
the 
day 
before 
yesterday 
not 
to 
forget 
Boris. 
But 
he 
had
no 
time. 
I 
hope, 
my 
dear 
friend, 
you 
will 
carry 
out 
your 
father's
wish?"

Pierre 
understood 
nothing 
of 
all 
this 
and 
coloring 
shyly 
looked 
in
silence 
at 
Princess 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna. 
After 
her 
talk 
with 
Pierre, 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
returned 
to 
the<p>
Rostovs' 
and 
went 
to 
bed. 
On 
waking 
in
the 
morning 
she 
told 
the 
Rostovs 
and 
all 
her 
acquaintances 
the 
details
of 
Count<p>
Bezukhov's 
death. 
She 
said 
the 
count 
had 
died 
as 
she 
would
herself 
wish 
to 
die, 
that 
his 
end 
was 
not 
only 
touching 
but 
edifying. 
As
to 
the 
last 
meeting 
between 
father 
and 
son, 
it 
was 
so 
touching 
that 
she
could 
not 
think 
of 
it 
without 
tears, 
and 
did 
not 
know 
which 
had 
behaved
better 
during 
those 
awful 
moments-the 
father 
who 
so 
remembered
everything 
and 
everybody 
at 
last 
and 
had 
spoken 
such 
pathetic 
words 
to
the 
son, 
or<p>
Pierre, 
whom 
it 
had 
been 
pitiful 
to 
see, 
so 
stricken 
was 
he
with 
grief, 
though 
he 
tried
