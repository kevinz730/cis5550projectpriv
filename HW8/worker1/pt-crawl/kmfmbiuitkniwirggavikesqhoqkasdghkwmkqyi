chased

along. 
Looking 
on 
<a href="/cZl/hU7NY4DduKC0zvJ.html">the</a> 
bridge 
he 
saw 
equally
uniform 
living 
waves 
of 
soldiers, 
shoulder 
straps, 
covered 
shakos,
knapsacks, 
bayonets, 
long 
muskets, 
and, 
under 
the 
shakos, 
faces 
with
broad 
cheekbones, 
sunken 
cheeks, 
and 
listless 
tired 
expressions, 
and
feet 
that 
moved 
through 
the 
sticky 
mud 
that 
covered 
the 
planks 
of 
the
bridge. 
Sometimes 
through 
the 
monotonous 
waves 
of 
men, 
like 
a<p>
fleck 
of
white 
foam 
on 
the 
waves 
of 
the 
Enns, 
an 
officer, 
in 
a 
cloak 
and 
with
a 
type 
of 
face 
different 
from 
that 
of 
the 
men, 
squeezed 
his 
way 
along;
sometimes 
like 
a 
chip 
of 
wood 
whirling 
in 
the 
river, 
an 
hussar 
on 
foot,
an 
orderly, 
or 
a 
townsman 
was 
carried 
through 
the 
waves 
of 
infantry;
and 
sometimes 
like 
a 
log 
floating 
down 
the 
river, 
an 
officers' 
or
company's 
baggage 
wagon, 
piled 
high, 
leather 
covered, 
and 
hemmed 
in 
on
all 
sides, 
moved 
across 
the 
bridge.

"It's 
as 
if 
a 
dam 
had 
burst," 
said 
the 
Cossack 
hopelessly. 
"Are
there 
many 
more 
of 
you 
to 
come?"

"A 
million 
all 
but 
one!" 
replied 
a 
waggish 
soldier 
in 
a 
torn 
coat,
with 
a 
wink, 
and 
passed 
on 
followed 
by 
another, 
an 
old 
man.

"If 
he" 
(he 
meant 
the 
enemy) 
"begins 
popping 
at 
the 
bridge 
now,"
said 
the 
old 
<a href="/cZl/rR4N5kNHe.html">soldier</a> 
dismally 
to 
a 
comrade, 
"you'll 
forget 
to
scratch 
yourself."

That 
soldier 
passed 
on, 
and 
after 
him 
came 
another 
sitting 
on 
a 
cart.

"Where 
the 
devil 
have 
the 
leg 
bands 
been 
shoved 
to?" 
said 
an
orderly, 
running 
behind 
the 
cart 
and 
fumbling 
in 
the 
back 
of 
it.

And 
he 
also 
passed 
on 
with 
the 
wagon. 
Then 
came 
some 
merry 
soldiers 
who
had 
evidently 
been 
drinking.

"And 
then, 
old 
fellow, 
he 
gives 
him 
one 
in 
the 
teeth 
with 
the 
butt
end 
of 
his 
gun..." 
a 
soldier 
whose<p>
greatcoat 
was 
well 
tucked 
up 
said
gaily, 
with 
a 
wide 
swing 
of 
his 
arm.

"Yes, 
the 
ham 
was 
just 
delicious..."
