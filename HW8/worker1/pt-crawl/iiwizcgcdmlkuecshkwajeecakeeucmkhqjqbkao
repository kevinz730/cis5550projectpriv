little 
princess 
curiously 
noting 
the</h1>impression
"Marie" 
produced 
on 
the 
visitors. 
And 
she 
saw 
Mademoiselle
Bourienne, 
with 
her 
ribbon 
and 
pretty 
face, 
and 
her 
unusually 
animated
look 
which 
was 
fixed 
on 
him, 
but 
him 
she 
could 
not 
see, 
she 
only 
saw
something 
large, 
brilliant, 
and 
handsome 
moving 
toward 
her 
as 
she
entered 
the 
room. 
Prince 
Vasili 
approached 
first, 
and 
she 
kissed 
the
bold 
forehead 
that 
bent 
over 
her 
hand 
and 
answered 
his 
question 
by
saying 
that, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/iP7IgdEd78g.html">on</a> 
the 
contrary, 
she 
remembered 
him 
quite 
well. 
Then
Anatole 
came 
up 
to 
her. 
She 
still 
could 
not 
see 
him. 
She 
only 
felt 
a
soft 
hand 
taking 
hers 
firmly, 
and 
she 
<a href="/aVzUge/fY9UHdX4tiRgR9gdRt.html">touched</a> 
with 
her 
lips 
a 
white
forehead, 
over 
which 
was 
beautiful 
light-brown 
hair 
smelling 
of 
pomade.
When 
she 
looked 
up 
at 
him 
she 
was 
struck 
by 
his 
beauty. 
Anatole 
stood
with 
his 
right 
<a href="/cZl/gAh6wKMFq6G5NtgpO.html">thumb</a> 
under 
a 
button 
of 
his 
uniform, 
his 
chest 
expanded
and 
his 
back 
drawn 
in, 
slightly 
swinging 
one 
foot, 
and, 
with 
his 
head 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vnk3Ro61BYyw.html">a
little</a> 
bent, 
looked<p>
with 
beaming 
face 
at 
the 
princess 
without
speaking 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Gw7YmejJ1rRC6eI.html">and</a> 
evidently 
not 
thinking 
about 
her 
at<p>
all. 
Anatole 
was 
not
quick-witted, 
nor 
ready 
or 
eloquent 
in 
conversation, 
but 
he 
had 
the
faculty, 
so 
invaluable 
in 
society, 
of 
composure 
and 
imperturbable
self-possession. 
If 
a 
man 
lacking 
in 
self-confidence 
remains 
dumb 
on
a 
first 
introduction 
and 
betrays 
a 
consciousness 
of 
the 
impropriety 
of
such 
silence 
and 
an 
anxiety 
to 
find 
something 
to 
say, 
the 
effect 
is
bad. 
But 
Anatole 
was 
dumb, 
swung 
his 
foot, 
and 
smilingly 
examined 
the
princess' 
hair. 
It 
was 
evident 
that 
he 
could 
be 
silent 
in 
this 
way 
for
a 
very<p>
long 
time. 
"If 
anyone 
finds 
this 
silence 
inconvenient, 
let 
him
talk, 
but 
I 
don't 
want 
to," 
he 
seemed 
to 
say. 
Besides 
this, 
in 
his
behavior 
to 
women 
Anatole 
had 
a 
manner 
which 
particularly 
inspires 
in
them 
curiosity, 
awe, 
and 
even 
love-a 
supercilious 
consciousness 
of
his 
own 
superiority. 
It 
was 
as 
if 
he 
said 
to 
them: 
"I 
know 
you, 
I 
know
you, 
but 
why 
should 
I 
bother 
about 
you? 
You'd 
be 
only 
too 
glad, 
of
course." 
Perhaps 
he 
did 
not 
really 
think 
this 
when 
he 
met 
women-even
probably 
he 
did 
not, 
for 
in 
general 
he 
thought 
very 
little-but 
his
looks 
and 
manner 
gave 
that 
impression. 
The 
princess 
felt 
this, 
and 
as 
if
wishing 
to 
show 
him 
that 
she 
did 
not 
even 
dare 
expect 
to 
interest 
him,
she 
turned 
to 
his 
father. 
The 
conversation 
was 
general 
and 
animated,
thanks 
to 
Princess 
Lise's 
voice 
and 
little 
downy 
lip 
that 
lifted
