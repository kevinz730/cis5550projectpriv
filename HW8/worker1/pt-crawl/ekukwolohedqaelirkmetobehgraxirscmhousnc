the</h1>countess. 
"But 
I 
am 
in 
great 
need 
of 
this 
sum."

"You, 
my 
little 
countess, 
are 
a 
notorious 
spendthrift," 
said 
the
count, 
and 
having 
kissed 
his 
wife's 
hand 
he 
went 
back 
to 
his 
study.

When 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
returned 
from 
Count 
Bezukhov's 
the 
money, 
all
in 
clean 
notes, 
was 
lying 
ready<p>
under 
a 
handkerchief 
on 
the 
countess'
little<p>
table, 
and 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
noticed 
that 
something 
was 
agitating
her.

"Well, 
my 
dear?" 
asked 
the 
countess.

"Oh, 
what 
a 
terrible 
state 
he 
is 
in! 
One 
would 
not 
know 
him, 
he 
is 
so
ill! 
I 
was 
only 
there 
a 
few 
moments 
and 
hardly 
said 
a 
word..."

"Annette, 
for 
heaven's 
sake 
don't 
refuse 
me," 
the 
countess
began, 
with 
a 
blush 
that 
looked 
very 
strange 
on 
her 
thin, 
dignified,
elderly 
face, 
and 
she 
took 
<a href="/aVzUge/vx3A2XKBx5CX.html">the</a> 
money 
from 
under 
the 
handkerchief.

Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
instantly 
guessed 
her 
intention 
and 
stooped 
to 
be
ready 
to 
embrace 
the 
countess 
at 
the<p>
appropriate 
moment.

"This 
is 
for 
Boris 
from 
me, 
for 
his 
outfit."

Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
was 
already 
embracing 
her 
and 
weeping. 
The 
countess
wept 
too. 
They 
wept 
because 
they 
were 
friends, 
and 
because 
they 
were
kindhearted, 
and 
because 
they-friends 
from 
childhood-had 
to 
think
about 
such 
a 
base 
thing 
as 
money, 
and 
because 
their 
youth 
was 
over....
But 
those 
tears 
were 
pleasant 
to 
them 
both.





CHAPTER 
XVIII

Countess 
Rostova, 
with 
her 
daughters 
and 
a 
large 
number 
of 
guests, 
was
already 
seated 
in 
the 
drawing 
room. 
The 
count 
took 
the 
gentlemen 
into
his 
study 
and 
showed 
them 
his 
choice 
collection 
of 
Turkish 
pipes. 
From
time 
to 
time 
he 
went 
out 
to 
ask: 
"Hasn't 
she 
come 
yet?" 
They
were 
expecting 
Marya<p>
Dmitrievna 
Akhrosimova, 
known 
in 
society 
as 
le
terrible 
dragon, 
a 
lady 
distinguished 
not 
for 
wealth 
or 
rank, 
but 
for
common 
sense 
and 
frank 
plainness 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/iV7QSsE26xhd.html">speech.</a> 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
was 
known
to 
the 
Imperial 
family 
as 
well 
as 
to 
all 
Moscow 
and 
Petersburg, 
and 
both
cities 
wondered 
at 
her,<p>
laughed 
privately 
at 
her 
rudenesses, 
and 
told
good 
stories 
about 
her, 
while 
none 
the 
less 
all 
without 
exception
respected 
and 
feared 
her.

In 
the 
count's 
room, 
which 
was<p>
full 
of 
tobacco 
smoke, 
they 
talked
of 
the 
war 
that 
had 
been 
announced 
in 
a 
manifesto, 
and 
about 
the
recruiting. 
None 
of 
them 
had 
yet 
seen 
the 
manifesto, 
but 
they 
all 
knew
it 
had 
appeared. 
The 
count 
sat 
on 
the 
sofa 
between 
two 
guests<p>
who 
were
smoking 
and 
talking. 
He 
neither 
smoked 
nor<p>
talked, 
but 
bending 
his 
head
first 
to 
one 
side 
and 
then 
to 
the 
other 
watched 
the 
smokers 
with 
evident
pleasure 
and 
listened 
to 
the 
conversation 
of 
his 
two 
neighbors, 
whom 
he
egged 
on 
against 
each 
other.

One 
of 
them 
was 
a 
sallow, 
clean-shaven 
civilian 
with 
a 
thin 
and 
wrinkled
face, 
already 
growing 
old, 
though 
he 
was 
dressed 
like 
a 
most 
fashionable
young 
man. 
He 
sat 
with 
his 
legs 
up 
on 
the 
sofa 
as 
if 
quite 
at 
home 
and,
having 
stuck 
an 
amber 
mouthpiece 
far 
into 
his 
mouth, 
was 
inhaling 
the
smoke 
spasmodically 
and 
screwing 
up 
his 
eyes. 
This 
was 
an 
old 
bachelor,
Shinshin, 
a 
cousin 
of 
the 
countess', 
a 
man 
with 
"a 
sharp 
tongue"
as 
they 
said 
in 
Moscow 
society.<p>
He 
seemed 
to 
be 
condescending 
to
his 
companion. 
The 
latter, 
a 
fresh, 
rosy 
officer 
of 
the 
Guards,
irreproachably 
washed, 
brushed, 
and 
buttoned, 
held 
his 
pipe 
in 
the
middle 
of 
his 
mouth 
and 
with 
red 
lips 
gently 
inhaled 
the 
smoke, 
letting
it 
escape 
from 
his 
handsome 
mouth 
in 
rings. 
This 
was 
Lieutenant 
Berg, 
an
officer 
in 
the 
Semenov 
regiment 
with 
whom 
Boris 
was 
to 
travel 
to 
join
the 
army, 
and 
about 
whom 
Natasha 
had 
teased 
her 
elder 
sister 
Vera,
speaking 
of 
Berg 
as 
her 
"intended." 
The 
count 
sat 
between 
them 
and
listened 
attentively. 
His 
favorite 
occupation 
when 
not 
playing 
boston, 
a
card 
game 
he 
was 
very 
fond 
of, 
was 
that 
of 
listener, 
especially 
when 
he
succeeded
