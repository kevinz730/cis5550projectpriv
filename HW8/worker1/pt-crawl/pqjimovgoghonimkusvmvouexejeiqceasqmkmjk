he 
has 
nothing 
to 
forgive....</h1>If 
I
were 
in 
his 
place..."

By 
association 
of 
ideas, 
Pierre 
was 
at 
once 
carried 
back 
to 
the 
day
when, 
trying 
to 
comfort 
her, 
he 
had 
said 
that 
if 
he 
were 
not 
himself 
but
the 
best 
man 
in 
the 
world 
and 
free, 
he 
would 
ask 
on 
his 
knees 
for 
her
hand; 
and 
the 
same 
feeling 
of 
pity, 
tenderness, 
and 
love 
took 
possession
of 
him 
and 
the 
same 
words 
rose 
to 
his 
<a href="/cZl/Of2bWUL8.html">lips.</a> 
But 
she 
did 
not 
give 
him
time 
to<p>
say 
them.

"Yes, 
you... 
you..." 
she 
said, 
uttering 
the 
word 
you 
rapturously-"that's
a 
different 
thing. 
I 
know 
no 
one 
kinder, 
more 
generous, 
or 
better 
than
you; 
nobody 
could 
be!<p>
Had 
you 
not 
been 
there 
then, 
and 
now 
too, 
I 
don't
know 
what 
would 
have 
become 
of 
me, 
because..."

Tears 
suddenly 
rose 
in 
her 
eyes, 
she 
turned 
away, 
lifted 
her 
music
before 
her 
eyes, 
began 
singing 
again, 
and 
again 
began 
walking 
up 
and
down 
the 
room.

Just 
then 
Petya 
came 
running 
in 
from 
the 
drawing 
room.

Petya<p>
was 
now 
a 
handsome 
rosy 
lad 
of 
fifteen 
with 
full 
red 
lips 
and
resembled 
Natasha. 
He 
was 
preparing 
to 
enter 
the 
university, 
but 
he 
and
his 
friend 
Obolenski 
had 
lately, 
in 
<a href="/cZl/nHL3COCd3hQrxS2omA.html">secret,</a> 
agreed 
to 
join 
the 
hussars.

Petya 
had 
come 
rushing 
out 
to 
talk 
to 
his 
namesake 
about 
this 
affair.
He 
had 
asked 
Pierre 
to 
find 
out 
whether 
he 
would 
be 
accepted 
in 
the
hussars.

Pierre 
walked 
up 
and 
down 
the 
drawing 
room, 
not 
listening 
to 
what 
Petya
was 
saying.

Petya 
pulled 
him 
by 
the 
arm 
to 
attract 
his 
attention.

"Well, 
what 
about 
my 
plan? 
Peter 
Kirilych, 
for 
heaven's<p>
sake! 
You 
are 
my
only 
hope," 
said 
Petya.

"Oh 
yes, 
your 
plan. 
To 
join 
the 
hussars? 
I'll 
mention 
it, 
I'll 
bring<p>
it
all 
up 
today."

"Well, 
mon 
cher, 
have 
you 
got 
the 
manifesto?" 
asked 
the 
old 
count. 
"The
countess 
has 
been 
to 
Mass 
at 
the 
Razumovskis' 
and 
heard 
the 
new 
prayer.
She 
says 
it's 
very 
fine."

"Yes, 
I've 
got 
it," 
said 
Pierre. 
"The 
Emperor 
is 
to 
be 
here 
tomorrow...
there's 
to 
be 
an 
Extraordinary 
Meeting 
of 
the 
nobility, 
and 
they 
are
talking 
of 
a 
levy 
of 
ten 
men 
per 
thousand. 
Oh 
yes, 
let 
me 
congratulate
you!"

"Yes, 
yes, 
thank 
God! 
Well, 
and 
what 
news 
from 
the 
army?"

"We 
are 
again 
retreating. 
They 
say 
we're 
already 
near 
Smolensk," 
replied
Pierre.

"O 
Lord, 
O 
Lord!" 
exclaimed 
the 
count. 
"Where 
is 
the 
manifesto?"

"The 
Emperor's 
appeal? 
Oh 
yes!"

Pierre 
began 
feeling 
in 
his 
pockets 
for 
the 
papers, 
but 
could 
not 
find
them. 
Still 
slapping 
his 
pockets, 
he 
kissed 
the 
hand 
of 
the<p>
countess
who 
entered 
the 
room 
and 
glanced 
uneasily 
around, 
evidently 
expecting
Natasha, 
who 
had 
left 
off 
singing 
but 
had 
not<p>
yet 
come 
into 
the 
drawing
room.

"On 
my 
<a href="/cZl/eI3e7.html">word,</a> 
I 
don't 
know 
what 
I've 
done 
with 
it," 
he 
said.

"There 
he 
is, 
always 
losing 
everything!" 
remarked 
the 
countess.

Natasha 
entered 
with 
a 
softened 
and 
agitated 
expression 
of 
face 
and
sat 
down<p>
looking 
silently 
at 
Pierre. 
As 
soon 
as 
she 
entered, 
Pierre's
features, 
which 
had 
been 
gloomy, 
suddenly 
lighted 
up, 
and 
while 
still
searching 
for 
the 
papers 
he 
glanced 
at 
her 
several 
times.

"No, 
really! 
I'll 
drive 
home, 
I 
must 
have 
left 
them 
there. 
I'll
certainly..."

"But 
you'll 
be 
late 
for 
dinner."

"Oh! 
And 
my 
coachman 
has 
gone."

But 
Sonya, 
who 
had 
gone 
to 
look 
for 
the 
papers 
in 
the 
anteroom, 
had
found 
them 
in 
Pierre's 
hat, 
where 
he 
had 
carefully 
tucked 
them 
under 
the
lining. 
Pierre 
was 
about 
to 
begin 
reading.

"No, 
after 
dinner," 
said 
the 
old 
count, 
evidently 
expecting 
much
enjoyment 
from 
that 
reading.

At 
dinner, 
at 
which 
champagne 
was 
drunk 
to 
the 
health 
of 
the 
new
chevalier 
of 
St. 
George, 
Shinshin 
told 
them 
the 
town 
news, 
of 
the
illness 
of 
the 
old 
Georgian 
princess, 
of 
Metivier's 
disappearance 
from
Moscow, 
and 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mS2fY5hQrxS8OgAj.html">how</a> 
some 
German 
fellow 
had 
been 
brought 
to 
Rostopchin
and 
accused 
of 
being 
a 
French 
"spyer" 
(so 
Count 
Rostopchin 
had 
told 
the
story), 
and 
how 
Rostopchin 
let 
him 
go
