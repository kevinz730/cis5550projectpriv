tender
voice:

"I 
cannot 
come 
to 
visit 
you 
but 
is 
it 
possible 
that 
I 
shall 
never 
see
you? 
I 
love 
you 
madly. 
Can 
I 
never...?" 
and, 
blocking 
her 
path, 
he
brought 
his 
face 
close 
to 
hers.

His 
large, 
glittering, 
masculine 
eyes 
were 
so 
close 
to 
hers 
that 
she 
saw
nothing 
but 
them.

"Natalie?" 
he 
whispered 
inquiringly 
while 
she 
felt 
her 
hands 
being
painfully 
pressed. 
"Natalie?"

"I 
don't 
understand. 
I 
have 
nothing 
to 
say," 
her 
eyes<p>
replied.

Burning 
lips 
were<p>
pressed 
to 
hers, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
instant 
she 
felt
herself 
released, 
and 
Helene's 
footsteps 
and 
the 
rustle 
of 
her 
dress
were 
heard 
in 
the 
room. 
Natasha 
looked 
round 
at 
her, 
and 
then, 
red
and 
trembling, 
threw 
a 
frightened 
look 
of 
inquiry 
at 
Anatole 
and 
moved
toward 
the 
door.

"One 
word, 
just 
one, 
for 
God's 
sake!" 
cried 
Anatole.

She 
paused. 
She 
so 
wanted 
a 
word 
from 
him 
that 
would 
explain 
to 
her 
what
had 
happened 
and 
to 
which 
she 
could 
find 
no 
answer.

"Natalie, 
just 
a 
word, 
only 
one!" 
he 
kept 
repeating, 
evidently 
not
knowing 
what 
to 
say 
and 
he 
repeated 
it 
till 
Helene 
came 
up 
to 
them.

Helene 
returned 
with 
Natasha 
to 
the 
drawing 
room. 
The 
Rostovs 
went
away 
without 
staying 
for 
supper.

After 
reaching 
home 
Natasha 
did 
not 
sleep 
all 
night. 
She 
was 
tormented
by 
the 
insoluble 
question 
whether 
she 
loved 
Anatole 
or 
Prince 
Andrew.
She 
loved 
Prince 
Andrew-she 
remembered 
distinctly 
how 
deeply 
she 
loved
him. 
But 
she 
also 
loved 
Anatole, 
of 
that 
there 
was 
no 
doubt. 
"Else 
how
could 
all 
this 
have 
happened?" 
thought 
she. 
"If, 
after 
that, 
I 
could
return 
his 
smile 
when 
saying 
good-by, 
if 
I 
was 
able 
to 
let 
it 
come<p>
to
that, 
it 
means 
that 
I 
loved 
him 
from 
the 
first. 
It 
means 
that 
he 
is
kind, 
noble, 
and 
splendid, 
and 
I<p>
could 
not 
help 
loving 
him. 
What 
am 
I 
to
do 
if 
I 
love 
him 
and 
the 
other 
one 
too?" 
she 
asked 
herself, 
unable 
to
find 
an 
answer 
to 
these 
terrible 
questions.





CHAPTER 
XIV

Morning 
came 
with 
its 
cares 
and 
bustle. 
Everyone 
got 
up 
and 
began
to 
move 
about 
and 
talk, 
dressmakers 
came 
again. 
Marya 
Dmitrievna
appeared, 
and 
they 
were 
called 
to 
breakfast. 
Natasha 
kept 
looking
uneasily 
<a href="/cZl/tK7pufMC.html">at</a> 
everybody 
with 
wide-open 
eyes, 
as 
if 
wishing 
to 
intercept
every 
glance 
directed 
toward 
her, 
and 
tried 
to 
appear 
the 
same 
as
