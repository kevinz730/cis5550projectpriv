He 
could 
not 
weep. 
The
old 
man 
too 
came 
up 
and 
kissed 
the 
waxen 
little 
hands 
that 
lay 
quietly
crossed 
one 
on 
the 
other 
on 
her 
breast, 
and 
to 
him, 
too, 
her 
face 
seemed
to 
say: 
"Ah, 
what 
have 
you 
done 
to 
me, 
and 
why?" 
And 
at 
the 
sight
the 
old 
man 
turned 
angrily 
away.


Another 
five 
days 
passed, 
and 
then 
the 
young 
Prince 
Nicholas 
Andreevich
was 
baptized. 
The 
wet 
nurse 
supported 
the 
coverlet 
with<p>
her 
chin, 
while
the 
priest 
with 
a 
goose 
feather 
anointed 
the 
boy's 
little 
red 
and
wrinkled 
soles 
and 
palms.

His 
grandfather, 
who 
was 
his 
godfather, 
trembling 
and 
afraid 
of 
dropping
him, 
carried 
the 
infant 
round 
the 
battered 
tin 
font 
and 
handed 
him 
over
to 
the 
godmother, 
Princess 
Mary. 
Prince 
Andrew 
sat 
in 
another 
room,
faint 
with 
fear 
lest 
the 
baby 
should 
be 
drowned 
in 
the 
font, 
and 
awaited
the 
termination 
of 
the 
ceremony. 
He 
looked 
up 
joyfully 
at 
the 
baby 
when
the 
nurse 
brought 
<a href="/aVzUge/iG6on6f4RPq.html">it</a> 
to 
him 
and 
nodded 
approval 
when 
she 
told 
him 
that
the 
wax 
with 
the 
baby's 
hair 
had 
not 
sunk 
in 
the 
font 
but 
had 
floated.





CHAPTER 
X

Rostov's 
share 
in 
Dolokhov's 
duel 
with 
Bezukhov 
was 
hushed 
up 
by
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
old 
count, 
and 
instead 
of 
being 
degraded 
to 
the 
ranks
as 
he 
expected 
he 
was 
appointed 
an<p>
adjutant 
to 
the 
governor 
general 
of
Moscow. 
As 
a 
result 
he 
could 
not 
go 
to 
the 
country 
with 
the 
rest 
of 
the
family,<p>
but 
was 
kept 
all 
summer 
in 
Moscow 
by 
his 
new 
duties. 
Dolokhov
recovered, 
and 
Rostov 
became 
very 
friendly 
with 
him 
during 
his
convalescence. 
Dolokhov 
lay 
ill 
at 
his 
mother's 
who 
loved 
him
passionately 
and 
tenderly, 
and 
old 
Mary 
Ivanovna, 
who 
had 
grown 
fond 
of
Rostov 
for 
his 
friendship 
to 
her 
Fedya, 
often 
talked 
to 
him 
about 
her
son.

"Yes, 
Count," 
she 
would 
say, 
"he 
is 
too 
noble 
and 
pure-souled 
for
our 
present, 
depraved 
world. 
No 
one 
now 
loves 
virtue; 
it 
seems 
like
a 
reproach 
to 
everyone. 
Now 
tell 
me, 
Count, 
was 
it 
right, 
was 
it
honorable, 
of 
Bezukhov? 
And 
Fedya, 
with 
his<p>
noble 
spirit,<p>
loved 
him
and 
even 
now 
never 
says 
a 
word 
against 
him. 
Those 
pranks 
in 
Petersburg
when 
they 
played 
some 
tricks 
on 
a 
policeman, 
didn't 
they 
do 
it
together? 
And 
there!
