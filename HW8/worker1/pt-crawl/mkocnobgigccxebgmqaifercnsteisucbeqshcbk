and 
what</h1>is 
his 
life 
worth? 
It's 
a
burden 
to 
him, 
and 
Bory's 
life 
is 
only 
just 
beginning...."

"Surely 
he 
will 
leave 
something 
to 
Boris," 
said 
the 
countess.

"Heaven 
only 
knows, 
my 
dear! 
These 
rich 
grandees 
are 
so 
selfish.
Still, 
I 
will 
take 
Boris 
and 
go 
to 
see 
him 
at 
once, 
and 
I 
shall 
speak
to 
him 
straight 
out. 
Let 
people 
think 
what 
they 
will 
of 
me, 
it's
really 
all 
the 
same 
to 
me 
when 
my 
son's 
fate 
is 
at 
stake." 
The
princess 
rose. 
"It's 
now 
two 
o'clock 
and 
you 
dine 
at 
four. 
There
will 
just 
be 
time."

And 
like 
a 
practical 
Petersburg<p>
lady 
who 
knows 
how 
to 
make 
the 
most 
of
time, 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
sent 
someone 
to 
call 
her 
son, 
and 
went 
into 
the
anteroom 
with 
him.

"Good-by, 
my 
dear," 
said 
she 
to 
the 
countess 
who 
saw 
her 
to 
the
door, 
and 
added 
in 
a 
whisper 
so 
that 
her 
son 
should 
not 
hear, 
"Wish 
me
good 
luck."

"Are 
you 
going 
to 
Count 
Cyril 
Vladimirovich, 
my 
dear?" 
said 
the
count 
coming 
out 
from 
the 
dining 
hall 
into 
the 
anteroom, 
and 
he 
added:
"If 
he 
is 
better, 
ask 
Pierre 
to 
dine 
with 
us. 
He 
has 
been 
to 
the
house, 
you 
know, 
and 
danced 
with 
the 
children. 
Be 
sure 
to 
invite 
him, 
my
dear. 
We 
will 
see 
how 
Taras 
distinguishes 
himself 
today. 
He 
says 
Count
Orlov 
never 
gave 
such 
a 
dinner 
as 
ours 
will 
be!"





CHAPTER 
XV

"My 
dear 
Boris," 
said 
Princess 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
to 
her 
son 
as
Countess 
Rostova's 
carriage 
in 
which 
they 
were 
seated 
drove 
over 
the
straw 
covered 
street 
and 
turned 
into 
the 
wide 
courtyard 
of 
Count 
Cyril
Vladimirovich 
Bezukhov's 
house. 
"My 
dear 
Boris," 
said 
the
mother, 
drawing 
her 
hand 
from 
beneath 
her 
old 
mantle 
and 
laying
it 
timidly 
and 
tenderly 
on 
her 
son's 
arm, 
"be 
affectionate 
and
attentive 
to 
him. 
Count 
Cyril 
Vladimirovich 
is 
your 
godfather 
after
all, 
and 
your 
future 
depends 
on 
him. 
Remember 
that, 
my 
dear, 
and 
be 
nice
to 
him, 
as 
you 
so 
well 
know 
how 
to 
be."

"If 
only 
I 
knew 
that 
anything 
besides 
humiliation 
would 
come 
of
it..." 
answered 
her 
son 
coldly. 
"But 
I 
have 
promised 
and 
will 
do 
it
for 
your 
sake."

Although 
the 
hall 
porter 
saw 
someone's 
carriage 
standing 
at 
the
entrance, 
after 
scrutinizing 
the 
mother 
and 
son 
(who 
without 
asking 
to
be 
announced 
had 
passed 
straight 
through 
the 
glass 
porch 
between 
the
rows 
of 
statues 
in 
niches) 
and 
looking 
significantly 
at 
the 
lady's 
old
cloak, 
he 
asked 
whether 
they 
wanted 
the 
count 
or 
the 
princesses, 
and,
hearing 
that 
they 
wished 
to 
see 
the 
count, 
said 
his 
excellency 
was 
worse
today, 
and 
that 
his 
excellency 
was 
not 
receiving 
anyone.

"We 
may 
as 
well 
go 
back," 
said 
the 
son 
in 
French.

"My 
dear!" 
exclaimed 
his 
mother 
imploringly, 
again 
laying 
her
