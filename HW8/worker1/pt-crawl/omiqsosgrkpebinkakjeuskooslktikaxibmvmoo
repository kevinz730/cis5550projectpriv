realm 
of 
beauty
and 
love 
which 
it 
was 
worth 
living 
for. 
Whatever 
worldly 
baseness
presented 
itself 
to 
him, 
he 
said 
to 
himself:

"Well, 
supposing 
N. 
N. 
has 
swindled 
the 
country 
and 
the 
Tsar, 
and 
the
country 
and 
the 
Tsar 
confer 
honors 
upon 
him, 
what 
does 
that 
matter? 
She
smiled 
at 
me 
yesterday 
and 
asked 
me 
to 
come 
again, 
and 
I 
love 
her, 
and
no 
one<p>
will 
ever 
know 
it." 
And 
his 
soul 
felt 
calm 
and 
peaceful.

Pierre 
still 
went 
into 
society, 
drank 
as 
much 
and 
led 
the 
same 
idle
and 
dissipated 
life, 
because 
besides 
the 
hours 
he 
spent 
at 
the 
Rostovs'
there 
were 
other 
hours 
he 
had 
to 
spend 
somehow, 
and 
the 
habits 
and
acquaintances 
he 
had 
made 
in 
Moscow 
formed 
a 
current 
that 
bore 
him 
along
irresistibly. 
But 
latterly, 
when 
more 
and 
more 
disquieting 
reports 
came
from 
the 
seat 
of 
war 
and 
Natasha's 
health 
began 
to 
improve 
and 
she
no 
longer 
aroused 
in 
him 
the 
former 
feeling 
of 
careful 
pity, 
an
ever-increasing 
restlessness, 
which 
he 
could 
not 
explain, 
took
possession 
of 
him. 
He 
felt 
that 
the 
condition 
he 
was 
in 
could 
not
continue 
long, 
that 
a 
catastrophe 
was 
coming 
which 
would 
change 
his
whole 
life, 
and 
he 
impatiently 
sought 
everywhere 
for 
signs 
of 
that
approaching 
catastrophe. 
One 
of 
his 
brother 
Masons 
had 
revealed 
to
Pierre 
the 
following 
prophecy 
concerning 
Napoleon, 
drawn 
from 
the
Revelation 
of 
St. 
John.

In 
chapter 
13, 
verse 
18, 
of 
the 
Apocalypse, 
it 
is 
said:

Here 
is 
wisdom. 
Let 
him 
that 
hath 
understanding 
count 
the 
number 
of
the 
beast: 
for<p>
it 
is 
the 
number 
of 
a 
man; 
and 
his 
number 
is 
Six 
hundred
threescore 
and 
six.

And 
in 
the<p>
fifth 
verse 
of 
the 
same 
chapter:

And 
there 
was 
given 
unto 
him 
a 
mouth 
speaking 
great 
things 
and
blasphemies; 
and 
power 
was 
given 
unto 
him 
to 
continue 
forty 
and 
two
months.
