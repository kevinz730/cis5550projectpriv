home 
from</h1>Vorontsovo, 
as 
he 
was 
passing 
the 
Bolotnoe 
Place
Pierre, 
seeing 
a 
large 
crowd 
round 
the 
Lobnoe 
Place, 
stopped 
and 
got 
out
of 
his 
trap. 
A 
French 
cook 
accused 
of 
being 
a 
spy 
was 
being 
flogged. 
The
flogging 
<a href="/aVzUge/wd8YyaBP8mTUVM0.html">was</a><p>
only 
just 
over, 
and 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/ce5sbb6XKBx4bKMVG.html">executioner</a> 
was 
releasing 
from 
the
flogging 
bench 
a 
stout 
man 
with 
red 
whiskers, 
in 
blue 
stockings 
and
a 
green 
jacket, 
who 
was 
moaning 
<a href="/nocrawl/c8Rhi6R/Crl64tEu3mJ.html">piteously.</a> 
Another 
criminal, 
thin 
<a href="/aVzUge/aq7oJSwZ6sCi9cLYU.html">and
pale,</a> 
stood 
near. 
Judging 
by 
their 
faces 
they 
were 
both 
Frenchmen. 
With
a 
frightened 
and 
suffering 
look 
resembling 
that 
on 
the 
thin
