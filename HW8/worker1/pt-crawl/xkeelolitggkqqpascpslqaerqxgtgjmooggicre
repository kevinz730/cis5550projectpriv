and 
received 
from 
the 
footman 
by 
bare 
girlish 
arms 
from
behind 
the 
door. 
Ten 
minutes 
later, 
all 
the 
young 
Melyukovs 
joined 
the
mummers.

Pelageya 
Danilovna, 
having 
given 
orders 
to 
clear 
the 
rooms 
for 
the
visitors 
and 
arranged 
about 
refreshments 
for 
the 
gentry 
and 
the 
serfs,
went 
about 
among 
the 
mummers 
without 
removing 
her 
spectacles, 
peering
into 
their 
faces 
with 
a 
suppressed 
smile 
<a href="/aVzUge/CBh70Wtx0nQqE.html">and</a> 
failing 
to 
recognize 
any
of 
them. 
It 
was 
not 
merely 
Dimmler 
and 
the 
Rostovs 
she 
failed 
to
recognize, 
she 
did 
not 
even 
recognize 
her 
own 
daughters, 
or 
her 
late
husband's, 
dressing 
<a href="/aVzUge/hfW4o2vtfU0.html">gowns</a> 
and 
uniforms, 
which 
they 
had 
put 
on.

"And 
who 
is 
this?" 
she 
asked 
her 
governess, 
peering 
into 
the 
face 
of
her 
own 
daughter 
dressed 
up 
as 
a 
Kazan-Tartar. 
"I 
suppose 
it 
is 
one
of 
the 
Rostovs! 
Well, 
Mr. 
Hussar, 
and 
what 
regiment 
do 
you 
serve 
in?"
she 
asked 
Natasha. 
"Here, 
hand 
some 
fruit 
jelly 
to 
the 
Turk!"
she 
ordered 
the 
butler 
who 
was 
handing 
things 
round.<p>
"That's 
not
forbidden 
by 
his 
law."

Sometimes, 
as 
she 
looked 
at 
the 
strange 
but 
amusing 
capers 
cut 
by 
the
dancers, 
who-having 
decided 
once 
for 
<a href="/cZl/ka8KXJ0iU9aAcKW.html">all</a> 
that 
being 
disguised, 
no 
one
would 
recognize 
them-were 
not 
at 
all 
shy, 
Pelageya 
Danilovna 
hid
her 
face 
in 
her 
handkerchief, 
and 
her 
whole 
stout 
body 
shook 
with
irrepressible, 
kindly, 
elderly 
laughter.

"My 
little 
Sasha!<p>
Look 
at 
Sasha!" 
she 
said.

After 
Russian 
country 
dances 
and 
chorus 
dances, 
Pelageya 
Danilovna
made 
the 
serfs 
and 
gentry 
join 
in 
one 
large 
circle: 
a 
ring, 
a 
string,
and 
a 
silver 
ruble
