ryefield 
and</h1>away 
from 
Nicholas.

He 
saw 
the 
whips 
in 
their 
red 
caps 
galloping 
along 
the 
edge 
of 
the
ravine, 
he 
even 
saw 
the 
hounds, 
and 
was 
expecting 
a 
fox 
to 
show 
itself
at 
any 
moment 
on 
the 
ryefield 
opposite.

The<p>
huntsman 
standing 
in 
the 
hollow 
moved 
and 
loosed 
his 
borzois, 
and
Nicholas 
saw 
a 
queer, 
short-legged 
red 
fox 
with 
a 
fine 
brush 
going 
hard
across 
the 
field. 
The 
borzois 
bore 
down 
on 
it.... 
Now 
they 
drew 
close
to 
the 
fox 
which 
began 
to 
dodge 
between 
the 
field 
in 
sharper 
and 
sharper
curves, 
trailing 
its 
brush, 
when 
suddenly 
a 
strange 
white 
borzoi 
dashed
in 
followed 
by 
a 
black 
one, 
and 
everything 
was 
in 
confusion; 
the 
borzois
formed 
a 
star-shaped 
figure, 
scarcely 
swaying 
their 
bodies 
and 
with
tails 
turned 
away 
from 
the 
center 
of 
the 
group. 
Two 
huntsmen 
galloped 
up
to 
the 
dogs; 
one 
in 
<a href="/aVzUge/TL80r3HV.html">a</a> 
red 
cap, 
the 
other, 
a 
stranger, 
in 
a 
green 
coat.

"What's 
this?" 
thought 
Nicholas. 
"Where's 
that 
huntsman 
from?
He 
is 
not 
'Uncle's' 
man."

The 
huntsmen 
got 
the 
fox, 
but 
stayed 
there 
a 
long 
time 
without 
strapping
it 
to 
the 
saddle. 
Their 
horses, 
bridled 
and 
with 
high 
saddles, 
stood
near 
them 
and 
there 
too 
the 
dogs 
were 
lying. 
The 
huntsmen 
waved 
their
arms 
and 
did 
something 
to 
the 
fox. 
Then 
from 
that 
spot 
came 
the 
sound 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/qQ2UKBi8LEWO8IZ.html">of
a</a> 
horn, 
with 
the 
signal 
agreed 
on 
in 
case 
of 
a 
fight.
