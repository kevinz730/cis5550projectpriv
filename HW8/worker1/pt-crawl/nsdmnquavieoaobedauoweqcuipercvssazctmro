his 
elbows 
on 
the 
table 
in 
a
pensive 
attitude.

"Yes, 
my 
dear 
friend," 
he 
began, 
"such 
is 
fortune's 
caprice. 
Who 
would
have 
said 
that 
I 
should 
be 
a 
soldier 
and 
a 
captain 
of 
dragoons 
in 
the
service 
of 
Bonaparte, 
as 
we 
used 
to 
call 
him? 
Yet 
here 
I 
am 
in 
Moscow
with 
him. 
I 
must 
tell 
<a href="/aVzUge/BG5fvg4bzE0S.html">you,</a> 
mon 
cher," 
he 
continued 
in 
the 
sad 
and
measured 
tones 
of 
a 
man 
who 
intends 
to 
tell 
a 
long 
story, 
"that 
our 
name
is 
one 
of 
the 
most 
ancient 
in 
France."

And 
with 
a 
Frenchman's 
easy 
and 
naive 
frankness 
the 
captain 
told 
Pierre
the 
story 
of 
his 
ancestors, 
his 
childhood, 
youth, 
and 
manhood, 
and 
all
about 
his 
relations 
and 
his 
financial 
and 
family 
affairs, 
"ma 
pauvre
mere" 
playing 
of 
course 
an 
important 
part 
in 
the 
story.

"But 
all 
that 
is 
only 
life's 
setting, 
the 
real 
thing 
is 
love-love! 
Am 
I
not 
right, 
Monsieur 
Pierre?" 
said 
he, 
growing 
animated. 
"Another 
glass?"

Pierre 
<a href="/cZl/pM8O1Xs.html">again</a> 
emptied 
his 
glass 
and 
poured 
himself 
out 
a 
third.

"Oh, 
women, 
women!" 
and 
the 
captain, 
looking 
with 
glistening 
eyes 
at
Pierre, 
began 
talking 
of 
love 
and 
of 
his 
love 
affairs.

There 
were 
very 
many 
of 
these, 
as 
<a href="/cZl/mD6YysHj7DbPtL9cw.html">one</a> 
could 
easily 
believe, 
looking
at 
the 
officer's 
handsome, 
self-satisfied 
face, 
and 
noting 
the 
eager
enthusiasm 
with 
which 
he 
spoke 
of 
women. 
Though 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/RZ4R0suxK1vf.html">all</a> 
Ramballe's 
love
stories 
had 
the 
sensual 
character 
which 
Frenchmen 
regard 
as 
the 
special
charm 
and 
poetry 
of 
love, 
yet 
he 
told 
his 
story 
with 
such 
sincere
conviction 
that 
he
