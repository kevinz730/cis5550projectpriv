thinking 
that 
Prince 
Andrew</h1>was 
unhappy, 
had 
gone 
astray, 
did 
not
see 
the 
true 
light, 
and 
that 
he, 
Pierre, 
ought 
to 
aid, 
enlighten, 
and
raise 
him. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
thought 
of 
what 
he 
should 
say, 
he 
felt 
that
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
one 
word, 
one 
argument, 
would 
upset 
all 
his 
teaching,
and 
he 
shrank 
from<p>
beginning, 
afraid 
of 
exposing 
to 
possible 
ridicule
what 
to 
him 
was 
precious 
and 
sacred.

"No, 
but 
why 
do 
you 
think 
so?" 
Pierre<p>
suddenly 
began, 
lowering 
his
head 
and 
looking 
like 
a 
bull 
about 
to 
charge, 
"why 
do 
you 
think 
so?
You 
should 
not 
think 
so."

"Think? 
What 
about?" 
asked 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
surprise.

"About 
life, 
about 
man's 
destiny. 
It 
can't 
be 
so. 
I 
myself 
thought
like 
that, 
and 
do 
you 
know 
what 
saved 
me? 
Freemasonry! 
No, 
don't
smile. 
Freemasonry 
is 
not 
a 
religious 
ceremonial 
sect, 
as 
I 
thought
it 
was: 
Freemasonry 
is 
the 
best 
expression 
of 
the 
best, 
the 
eternal,
aspects 
of 
humanity."

And 
he 
began 
to 
explain 
Freemasonry 
as 
he 
understood 
it 
to 
Prince
Andrew. 
He<p>
said 
that 
Freemasonry 
is 
the 
teaching 
of 
Christianity 
freed
from 
the 
bonds 
of 
State 
and 
Church, 
a 
teaching 
of 
equality, 
brotherhood,
and 
love.

"Only 
our 
holy 
brotherhood 
has 
the 
real 
meaning 
of 
life, 
all 
the 
rest
is 
a 
dream," 
said 
Pierre. 
"Understand, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
that 
outside
this 
union 
all 
is 
filled 
with 
deceit 
and 
falsehood 
and 
I 
agree 
with 
you
that 
nothing 
is 
left 
for 
an 
intelligent 
and 
good 
man 
but 
to 
live 
out
his 
life, 
like 
you, 
merely 
trying 
not 
to 
harm 
others. 
But 
make 
our
fundamental 
convictions 
your 
own, 
join 
our 
brotherhood, 
give 
yourself 
up
to 
us, 
let 
yourself 
be 
guided, 
and 
you 
will 
at 
once 
feel 
yourself, 
as 
I
have 
felt 
myself, 
a 
part 
of 
that 
vast 
invisible 
chain 
the 
beginning 
of
which 
is 
hidden<p>
in 
heaven," 
said 
Pierre.

Prince 
Andrew, 
looking 
straight 
in 
front 
of 
him, 
listened 
in 
silence 
to
Pierre's 
words. 
More 
than 
once, 
when 
the 
noise 
of 
the 
wheels 
prevented
his 
catching 
what 
Pierre 
said, 
he 
asked 
him 
to 
repeat 
it, 
and 
by 
the
peculiar<p>
glow 
that 
came 
into 
Prince 
Andrew's 
eyes 
and 
by 
his 
silence,
Pierre 
saw 
that 
his 
words 
were 
not 
in 
vain 
and 
that 
Prince 
Andrew 
would
not 
interrupt 
him 
or 
laugh 
at 
what 
he 
said.

They 
reached 
a 
river 
that 
had 
overflowed 
its 
banks 
and 
which 
they 
had 
to
cross
