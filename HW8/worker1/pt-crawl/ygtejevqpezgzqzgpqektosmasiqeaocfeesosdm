in

popular 
defense 
of 
Moscow 
which 
he 
knew 
was 
projected. 
And
with 
that 
object 
he 
had 
asked 
Gerasim 
to 
get 
him 
a 
peasant's 
coat 
and
a 
pistol, 
confiding 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ayy3vZzpo4i7MdWa.html">to</a> 
him 
his 
intentions 
of 
remaining 
in 
Joseph
Alexeevich's 
house 
and 
keeping 
his 
name 
secret. 
Then 
during 
the 
first
day 
spent 
in 
inaction 
and 
solitude 
(he 
tried 
several 
times 
to 
fix 
his
attention

the

the 
idea 
that 
he, 
L'russe 
Besuhof, 
was 
destined 
to 
set 
a
limit 
to 
the

only 
one 
of 
the 
fancies

often 
passed 
through 
his 
mind 
and 
left 
no 
trace

When, 
having 
bought 
the 
coat 
merely 
with 
the 
object 
of 
taking 
part 
among
the 
people 
in 
the 
defense 
of 
Moscow, 
Pierre 
had 
met 
the 
Rostovs 
and
Natasha 
had 
said 
to 
him:

Moscow?...
