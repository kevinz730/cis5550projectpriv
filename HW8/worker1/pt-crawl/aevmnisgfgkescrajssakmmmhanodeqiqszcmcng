my 
wife's</h1>absence. 
At 
the 
time 
I
gave 
him 
no 
answer.<p>
Now 
I 
recalled 
every 
detail 
of 
that 
meeting 
and 
in
my 
mind 
gave 
him 
the 
most 
malevolent 
and 
bitter 
replies. 
I 
recollected
myself 
and 
drove 
away 
that 
thought 
only 
when 
I 
found 
myself 
glowing 
with
anger, 
but 
I 
did 
not 
sufficiently 
repent. 
Afterwards 
Boris 
Drubetskoy
came 
and 
began 
relating 
various 
adventures. 
His 
coming 
vexed 
me 
from 
the
first, 
and 
I 
said 
something 
disagreeable 
to 
him. 
He 
replied. 
I 
flared
up 
and 
said 
much 
that 
was 
unpleasant 
and<p>
even 
rude 
to 
him. 
He 
became
silent, 
and 
I 
recollected 
myself 
only 
when 
it 
was 
too 
late. 
My 
God, 
I
cannot 
get 
on 
with 
him 
at 
all. 
The 
cause 
of 
this 
is 
my 
egotism. 
I 
set
myself 
above 
him 
and 
so 
become<p>
much 
worse 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/kZ4fOHvf2WG6GdRBS.html">than</a> 
he, 
for 
he 
is 
lenient
to 
my 
rudeness 
<a href="/aVzUge/iw8N8xt8Nw.html">while</a> 
I 
on 
the 
contrary 
nourish 
contempt 
for 
him. 
O 
God,
grant 
that 
in 
his 
presence 
I 
may 
rather 
see 
my 
own 
vileness, 
and 
behave
so 
that 
he 
too 
may 
benefit. 
After 
dinner 
I 
fell 
asleep 
and 
as 
I 
was
drowsing 
off 
I 
clearly 
heard 
a 
voice 
saying 
in 
my 
left 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/iG2oJSwZ6rqw6.html">ear,</a> 
"Thy
day!"

I 
dreamed 
that 
I 
was 
walking 
in 
the 
dark 
and 
was 
suddenly 
surrounded 
by
dogs, 
but 
I 
went 
on 
undismayed. 
Suddenly 
a 
smallish 
dog 
seized 
my 
left
thigh<p>
with 
its 
teeth 
and 
would 
not 
let 
go. 
I 
began 
to 
throttle 
it 
with
my 
hands. 
Scarcely 
had 
I 
torn 
it 
off 
before 
another, 
a 
bigger 
one, 
began
biting 
me. 
I 
lifted 
it 
up, 
but 
the 
higher 
I 
lifted 
it 
the 
bigger 
and
heavier 
it 
grew. 
And<p>
suddenly 
Brother 
A. 
came 
and, 
taking 
my 
arm, 
led
me 
to 
a 
building 
to 
enter 
which 
we 
had 
to 
pass 
along 
a 
narrow 
plank.
I 
stepped 
on 
it, 
but 
it 
bent 
and 
gave 
way 
and 
I 
began 
to 
clamber 
up 
a
fence 
which 
I 
could 
scarcely 
reach 
with 
my 
hands. 
After 
much 
effort 
I
dragged 
myself 
up, 
so 
that 
my 
leg 
hung 
down 
on 
one 
side 
and 
my 
body 
on
the 
other. 
I 
looked 
round 
and 
saw 
Brother 
A. 
standing 
on 
the 
fence 
and
pointing 
me 
to 
a 
broad 
avenue 
and 
garden, 
and 
in 
the 
garden 
was 
a 
large
and 
beautiful 
building. 
I 
woke 
up. 
O 
Lord, 
great 
Architect 
of 
Nature,
help 
me 
to 
tear 
from 
myself 
these 
dogs-my 
passions 
especially 
the
last, 
which 
unites 
in 
itself 
the 
strength 
of 
all 
the 
former 
ones, 
and
aid 
me 
to 
enter 
that 
temple 
of 
virtue 
to 
a 
vision 
of 
which 
I 
attained 
in
my 
dream.


7th 
December

I 
dreamed 
that 
Joseph 
Alexeevich 
was 
sitting 
in 
my 
house, 
and 
that 
I
was 
very 
glad 
and 
wished 
to 
entertain 
him.<p>
It 
seemed 
as 
if 
I 
chattered
incessantly 
with 
other 
people 
and 
suddenly 
remembered 
that 
this 
could
not 
please 
him, 
and 
I 
wished 
to 
come<p>
close 
to 
him 
and 
embrace<p>
him. 
But
as 
soon 
as 
I 
drew 
near 
I 
saw 
that 
his 
face 
had 
changed 
and 
grown 
young,
and 
he 
was 
quietly 
telling 
me 
something 
about 
the 
teaching 
of 
our 
order,
but 
so 
softly 
that 
I 
could 
not 
hear 
it.
