three-year-old 
girl 
in 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/SX7b6Cr5a.html">pink</a></h1>dress 
was 
lying 
under 
a 
seat.

"There 
is 
your 
child! 
Oh, 
a 
girl, 
so 
much 
the 
better!" 
said 
the
Frenchman. 
"Good-by, 
Fatty. 
We 
must 
be 
human, 
we 
are 
all 
mortal 
you
know!" 
and 
the 
Frenchman 
with 
the 
spot 
on 
his 
cheek 
ran<p>
back 
to 
his
comrades.

Breathless 
with 
joy, 
Pierre 
ran 
to 
the 
little 
girl 
and 
was 
going 
to 
take
her 
in 
his 
arms. 
But 
seeing 
a 
stranger 
the 
sickly, 
scrofulous-looking
child, 
unattractively 
like 
her 
mother, 
began 
to 
yell 
and 
run 
away.
Pierre, 
however, 
seized 
her 
and 
lifted 
her 
in 
his 
arms. 
She 
screamed
desperately 
and 
angrily 
and 
tried 
with 
her 
little 
hands 
to 
pull 
Pierre's
hands 
away 
and 
to 
bite 
them 
with 
her 
slobbering 
mouth. 
Pierre 
was 
seized
by 
a 
sense 
of 
horror 
and 
repulsion 
such 
as 
he 
had 
experienced 
when
touching 
some 
nasty 
little 
animal. 
But 
he 
made 
an 
effort 
not 
to 
throw
the 
child 
down 
and 
ran 
with 
her 
to 
the 
large 
house. 
It 
was 
now, 
however,
impossible 
to 
get 
back 
the 
way 
he 
had 
come; 
the 
maid, 
Aniska, 
was 
no
longer 
there, 
and 
Pierre 
with 
a 
feeling 
of 
pity 
and 
disgust 
pressed 
the
wet, 
painfully 
sobbing 
child 
to 
himself 
as 
tenderly 
as 
he 
could 
and 
ran
with 
her 
through 
the 
garden 
seeking 
another 
way 
out.





CHAPTER 
XXXIV

Having 
run 
through 
different 
yards 
and 
side 
streets, 
Pierre 
got 
back
with 
his 
little 
burden 
to 
the 
Gruzinski 
garden 
at 
the 
corner 
of 
the
Povarskoy. 
He 
did 
not 
at 
first 
recognize 
the 
place 
from 
which 
he 
had 
set
out 
to 
look 
for 
the 
child, 
so 
crowded 
was 
it 
now 
with 
people 
and 
goods
that 
had 
been 
dragged 
out 
of 
the 
houses. 
Besides 
Russian 
families 
who
had 
taken 
refuge 
here 
from 
the 
fire
