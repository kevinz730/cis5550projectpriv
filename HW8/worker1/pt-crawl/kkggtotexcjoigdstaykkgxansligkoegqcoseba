disquieting 
reports</h1>about 
the 
war
began 
to 
spread 
in 
Moscow; 
people 
spoke 
of 
an 
appeal 
by 
the 
Emperor 
to
the 
people, 
and 
of 
his 
coming 
himself 
from 
the 
army 
to 
Moscow. 
And 
as
up 
to 
the 
eleventh 
of 
July 
no 
manifesto 
or 
appeal 
had 
been 
received,
exaggerated 
reports 
became 
current 
about 
them 
and 
about 
the 
position 
of
Russia. 
It 
was 
said<p>
that 
the 
Emperor 
was 
leaving 
the 
army 
because 
it 
was
in 
danger, 
it 
was 
said 
that 
Smolensk 
had 
surrendered, 
that 
Napoleon 
had
an 
army 
of 
a 
million 
and 
only 
a 
miracle 
could 
save 
Russia.

On 
the 
eleventh 
of 
July, 
which 
was 
<a href="/cZl/vCh9fCtXF7K4.html">Saturday,</a> 
the 
manifesto 
was 
received
but 
was 
not 
yet 
in 
print, 
and 
Pierre, 
who 
was 
at 
the 
Rostovs', 
promised
to 
come 
to 
dinner 
next<p>
day, 
Sunday, 
and 
bring 
a 
copy 
of 
the 
manifesto
and 
appeal, 
which 
he 
would 
obtain<p>
from 
Count 
Rostopchin.

That 
Sunday, 
the 
Rostovs 
went 
to 
Mass 
at 
the 
Razumovskis' 
private 
chapel
as 
usual. 
It 
was 
a 
hot 
July 
day. 
Even 
at 
ten 
o'clock, 
when 
the 
Rostovs
got 
out 
of 
their<p>
carriage 
at 
the 
chapel,<p>
the 
sultry 
air, 
the 
shouts 
of
hawkers, 
the 
light 
and 
gay 
summer 
clothes 
of 
the 
crowd, 
the 
dusty 
leaves
of 
the 
trees 
on 
the 
boulevard, 
the 
sounds 
of 
the 
band 
and 
the 
white
trousers 
of 
a 
battalion 
marching 
to 
parade, 
the 
rattling 
of 
wheels 
on
the 
cobblestones, 
and 
the 
brilliant, 
hot 
sunshine 
were 
all 
full 
of 
that
summer
