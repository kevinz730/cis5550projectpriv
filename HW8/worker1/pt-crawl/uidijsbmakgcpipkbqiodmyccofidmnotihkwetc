as 
a 
prisoner
to 
escape 
from 
all 
this 
horror 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/yu4qZ97a.html">and</a> 
misery; 
but 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
the 
force
of 
this 
common 
attraction 
to 
Smolensk, 
their 
goal, 
drew 
<a href="/aVzUge/vr3VEt0uq4gcnoA.html">each</a> 
of<p>
them 
in
the 
same 
direction; 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
an 
army 
corps 
could 
not 
surrender
to 
a 
company, 
and 
though 
the 
French 
availed 
themselves 
of 
every
convenient 
opportunity 
to 
detach 
themselves 
and 
to 
surrender 
on 
the
slightest 
decent 
pretext, 
such 
pretexts 
did 
not 
always 
occur. 
Their
very 
numbers<p>
and 
their 
crowded 
and 
swift 
movement 
deprived 
them 
of 
that
possibility 
and 
rendered 
<a href="/cZl/lg7mk5rqw7Yg.html">it</a> 
not 
only 
difficult 
but 
impossible 
for 
the
Russians 
to 
stop 
this 
movement, 
to 
which 
the 
French 
were 
directing 
all
their 
energies. 
Beyond 
a 
certain 
limit 
no 
mechanical 
disruption 
of 
the
body 
could 
hasten 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Nu5fnBp1NX3.html">process</a> 
of 
decomposition.

A 
lump 
of 
snow 
cannot 
be 
melted 
instantaneously. 
There 
is<p>
a 
certain
limit 
of 
time 
in 
less 
than 
which 
no 
amount 
of 
heat 
can 
melt 
the 
snow. 
On
the 
contrary 
the 
greater 
the 
heat 
the 
more 
solidified 
the 
remaining 
snow
becomes.

Of 
the 
Russian 
commanders 
Kutuzov 
alone 
understood 
this. 
When 
the 
flight
of 
the 
French 
army 
along 
the 
Smolensk 
road 
became 
well 
defined, 
what
Konovnitsyn 
had 
foreseen 
on 
the 
night 
of 
the 
eleventh 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NY9D9lLv5g.html">of</a> 
October 
began
to 
occur. 
The 
superior 
officers 
all 
wanted 
to 
distinguish 
themselves,
to 
cut 
off, 
to 
seize, 
to 
capture, 
and 
to 
overthrow 
the 
French, 
and 
all
clamored 
for 
action.

Kutuzov 
alone 
used 
all 
his 
power 
(and 
such 
power 
is 
very 
limited 
in 
the
case 
of 
any 
commander 
in 
chief) 
to 
prevent 
an 
attack.

He 
could 
not 
tell 
them 
what 
we 
say 
now:
