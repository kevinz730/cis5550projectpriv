as 
the 
resultant 
of 
a 
multiplicity 
of 
variously
directed 
forces. 
In 
describing 
a 
war 
or 
the 
subjugation 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UB3e1Gbiq7hBn.html">a</a> 
people, 
a
general 
historian 
looks 
for 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
event 
not 
in 
the 
power
of 
one 
man, 
but 
in 
the 
interaction 
of 
many 
persons 
connected 
with 
the
event.

According 
to 
this 
view 
the 
power 
of 
historical 
personages, 
represented
as 
the 
product 
of 
many 
forces, 
can 
no 
longer, 
it 
would 
seem, 
be 
regarded
as 
a 
force 
that 
itself 
produces 
events. 
Yet 
in 
most 
cases 
universal
historians 
still 
employ 
the 
conception 
of 
power 
as 
a 
force 
that 
itself
produces 
events, 
and 
treat 
it 
as 
their 
cause. 
In 
their 
exposition, 
an
historic 
character 
is 
first 
the 
product 
of 
his 
time, 
and 
his 
power 
only
the 
resultant 
of 
various 
forces, 
and 
then 
his 
power 
is 
itself 
a 
force
producing 
events.
