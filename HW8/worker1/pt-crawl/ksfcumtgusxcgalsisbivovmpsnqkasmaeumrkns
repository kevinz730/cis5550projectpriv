said 
Captain
Tushin<p>
smiling 
shyly 
in 
his 
uncomfortable 
position, 
evidently 
wishing
to 
adopt 
a 
jocular 
tone. 
But 
before 
he 
had 
finished 
he 
felt 
that 
his
jest 
was 
unacceptable 
and 
had 
not 
come 
off. 
He 
grew 
confused.

"Kindly 
return 
to 
your 
posts," 
said 
the 
staff 
officer 
trying 
to
preserve 
his 
gravity.

Prince 
Andrew 
glanced 
again 
at 
the 
artillery 
officer's 
small 
figure.
There 
was 
something 
peculiar 
about 
it, 
quite 
unsoldierly, 
rather 
comic,
but 
extremely 
attractive.

The 
staff 
officer 
and 
Prince 
Andrew 
mounted 
their 
horses 
and 
rode 
on.

Having 
ridden 
beyond 
the 
village, 
continually 
meeting 
and 
overtaking
soldiers 
and 
officers 
of 
various 
regiments, 
they 
saw 
on 
their 
left 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/pX5XZWkd6KpkPN5XZEHJ.html">some
entrenchments</a> 
being 
thrown 
up,<p>
the 
freshly 
dug 
clay 
of 
which 
showed 
up
red. 
Several 
battalions 
of 
soldiers, 
in 
their 
shirt 
sleeves 
despite
the 
cold 
wind, 
swarmed 
in 
these 
earthworks 
like 
a 
host 
of 
white 
ants;
spadefuls 
of 
red 
clay 
were 
continually 
being 
thrown 
up 
from 
behind 
the
bank 
by 
unseen 
hands. 
Prince 
Andrew 
and 
the 
officer 
rode 
up,<p>
looked 
at
the 
entrenchment, 
and 
went 
on 
again. 
Just 
behind 
it 
they 
came 
upon 
some
dozens 
of 
soldiers, 
continually 
replaced 
by 
others, 
who 
ran 
from 
the
entrenchment. 
They 
had 
to 
hold 
their 
noses 
and 
put 
their 
horses 
to 
a
trot 
to 
escape 
from 
the 
poisoned 
atmosphere 
of 
these 
latrines.

"Voila 
l'agrement 
des 
camps, 
monsieur 
le 
prince," 
* 
said 
the
staff 
officer.

 
 
 
 
* 
"This 
is 
a 
pleasure 
one 
gets 
in 
camp, 
Prince."


They 
rode 
up 
the 
opposite 
hill. 
From 
there 
the 
French 
could 
already 
be
seen. 
Prince 
Andrew 
stopped 
and 
began 
examining 
the 
position.

"That's 
our 
battery," 
said 
the 
staff 
officer 
indicating 
the
highest 
point. 
"It's 
<a href="/aVzUge/gJL2AgW2UGRY0uIRD.html">in</a> 
charge 
of 
the 
queer 
fellow 
we 
saw 
without
his 
boots. 
You 
can 
see 
everything 
from 
there; 
let's 
go 
there,
Prince."

"Thank 
you 
very 
much, 
I 
will 
go 
on 
alone," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew,
wishing 
to 
rid 
himself 
of 
this 
staff 
officer's 
company,<p>
"please
don't 
trouble 
yourself 
further."

The 
staff<p>
officer 
remained 
<a href="/cZl/Ig25jM2Ro.html">behind</a> 
and 
Prince 
Andrew 
rode 
on 
alone.

The 
farther 
forward 
and 
nearer 
the 
enemy 
he 
went, 
the 
more 
orderly 
and
cheerful 
were 
the 
troops. 
The 
greatest 
disorder 
and 
depression 
<a href="/cZl/jM2GLq7AjGP7ws.html">had</a> 
been
in 
the 
baggage 
train
