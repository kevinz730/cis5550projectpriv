Ivanovich," 
he 
suddenly 
went</h1>on, 
raising
his 
head 
and 
pointing 
to 
the 
plan 
of 
the 
building, 
"tell 
me 
how 
you 
mean
to 
alter 
it...."

Michael 
Ivanovich 
went 
up 
to 
the 
plan, 
and 
the 
prince 
after 
speaking 
to
him 
about 
the 
building 
looked 
angrily 
at 
Princess 
Mary 
and 
Dessalles 
and
went 
to 
his 
own 
room.

Princess 
Mary 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vQ29We6p.html">saw</a> 
Dessalles' 
embarrassed 
and 
astonished 
look 
fixed 
on
her<p>
father, 
noticed 
his 
silence, 
and 
was 
struck 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
her
father 
had 
forgotten 
his 
son's 
letter 
on 
the 
drawing 
room 
table; 
but 
she
was 
not 
only 
afraid 
to 
speak 
of 
it 
and 
ask 
Dessalles 
the 
reason 
of 
his
confusion 
and 
silence, 
but 
was 
afraid 
even 
to 
think 
about 
it.

In 
the 
evening 
Michael 
Ivanovich, 
sent 
by 
the 
prince, 
came 
to 
Princess
Mary<p>
for 
Prince 
Andrew's 
letter 
which 
had 
been 
forgotten 
in<p>
the 
drawing
room. 
She 
gave 
it 
to 
him 
and, 
unpleasant 
as 
it 
was 
to 
her 
to 
do 
so,
ventured 
to 
ask 
him 
what 
her 
father 
was 
doing.

"Always 
busy," 
replied 
Michael 
Ivanovich 
with 
a 
respectfully 
ironic
smile 
which 
caused 
Princess 
Mary 
to 
turn 
pale. 
"He's 
worrying 
very 
much
about 
the 
new 
building. 
He 
has 
been 
reading 
a 
little, 
but 
now"-Michael
Ivanovich 
went 
<a href="/cZl/omA43bOIDr7tjjJI.html">on,</a> 
lowering 
his 
voice-"now 
he's 
at 
his 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ta46MdWa0SwJMI.html">desk,</a> 
busy 
with
his 
will, 
I 
expect." 
(One 
of 
the 
prince's 
favorite 
occupations 
of 
late
had 
been 
the 
preparation 
of 
some 
papers 
he 
meant 
to 
leave 
at 
his 
death
and 
which 
he 
called 
his 
"will.")

"And 
Alpatych 
is 
being 
sent 
to 
Smolensk?" 
asked 
Princess 
<a href="/aVzUge/td26W1kQqNG.html">Mary.

"Oh,</a> 
yes, 
he 
has 
been 
waiting 
to 
start 
for 
some 
time."





CHAPTER 
III

When 
Michael 
Ivanovich 
returned 
to 
the 
study 
with 
the 
letter, 
the 
old
prince, 
with 
spectacles 
on<p>
and 
a 
shade 
over 
his 
eyes, 
was 
sitting 
at 
his
open 
bureau 
with 
screened 
candles, 
holding 
a 
paper 
in 
his 
outstretched
hand, 
and 
in 
a 
somewhat 
dramatic 
attitude 
was 
reading 
his 
manuscript-his
"Remarks" 
as 
he 
termed 
it-which 
was 
to 
be 
transmitted 
to 
the 
Emperor
after 
his 
death.

When 
Michael 
Ivanovich 
went 
in 
there 
were 
tears 
in 
the 
prince's 
eyes
evoked 
by 
the 
memory 
of 
the 
time 
when 
the 
paper 
he 
was 
now 
reading 
had
been 
written. 
He 
took 
the 
letter 
from 
Michael 
Ivanovich's 
hand, 
put 
it
in 
his 
pocket, 
folded 
up 
his 
papers, 
and 
called 
in 
Alpatych 
who 
had 
long
been 
waiting.

The 
prince 
had 
a 
list 
of 
things 
to 
be 
bought 
in 
Smolensk 
and, 
walking
up 
and 
down 
the 
room 
past 
Alpatych 
who 
stood 
by 
the 
door, 
he 
gave 
his
instructions.

"First, 
notepaper-do 
you 
hear? 
Eight 
quires, 
like 
this 
sample,
gilt-edged... 
it 
must 
be 
exactly 
like 
the 
sample.
