going 
to 
this 
terrible</h1>war, 
and 
he 
is 
so 
old? 
Mademoiselle
Bourienne 
says 
he 
has 
been 
asking 
about 
you...."

As 
soon 
as 
she 
began 
to 
speak 
of 
that, 
her 
lips 
trembled 
and 
her 
tears
began 
to<p>
fall. 
Prince 
Andrew 
turned 
away 
and 
began 
pacing 
the 
room.

"Ah, 
my 
God! 
my 
God! 
When 
one 
thinks 
who 
and 
what-what 
trash-can 
cause
people 
misery!" 
he 
said 
with 
a 
malignity 
that 
alarmed 
Princess 
Mary.

She 
understood 
that 
when 
speaking 
of 
"trash" 
he 
referred 
not 
only 
to
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
the 
cause 
of 
her 
misery, 
but 
also 
to 
the 
man 
who
had 
ruined 
his 
own 
happiness.

"Andrew! 
One 
thing 
I 
beg, 
I 
entreat 
of 
you!" 
she 
said, 
touching 
his
elbow 
and 
looking 
at 
him 
with 
eyes 
that 
shone 
through 
her 
tears. 
"I
understand 
you" 
(she 
looked 
down). 
"Don't 
imagine 
that 
sorrow 
is 
the
work 
of 
men. 
Men<p>
are 
His 
tools." 
She 
looked 
a 
little 
above 
Prince
Andrew's 
head 
with 
the 
confident, 
accustomed 
look 
with 
which 
one 
looks
at 
the 
place 
where 
a 
familiar 
portrait 
hangs. 
"Sorrow 
is 
sent 
by 
Him,
not 
by 
men. 
Men 
are 
His 
instruments, 
they 
are 
not 
to 
blame. 
If 
you 
think
someone 
has 
wronged 
you, 
forget 
it 
and 
forgive! 
We 
have 
no 
right 
to
punish. 
And 
then 
you 
will 
know 
the 
happiness 
of 
forgiving."

"If 
I 
were 
a 
woman 
I 
would 
do 
so, 
Mary. 
That 
is 
a 
woman's 
virtue. 
But
a 
man 
should 
not 
and 
cannot 
forgive 
and 
forget," 
he 
replied, 
and 
though
till 
that 
moment 
he 
had 
not 
been 
thinking 
of 
Kuragin, 
all 
his 
unexpended
anger 
suddenly 
swelled 
up 
in 
his 
heart.

"If 
Mary 
is 
already 
persuading 
me 
to 
forgive, 
it 
means 
that 
I 
ought 
long
ago 
to 
have 
punished 
him," 
he 
thought. 
And 
giving 
her 
no 
further 
reply,
he 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bfW1mbEd8npky.html">began</a> 
thinking 
of 
the 
glad 
vindictive 
moment 
when 
he 
would 
meet
Kuragin 
who 
he 
knew 
was 
now 
in 
the 
army.

Princess 
Mary 
begged 
him 
to 
stay 
one 
day 
more, 
saying 
that 
she 
knew 
how
unhappy 
her 
father 
would 
be 
if 
Andrew 
left 
without 
being 
reconciled 
to
him, 
but 
Prince 
Andrew 
replied 
that 
he 
would 
probably 
soon 
be 
back 
again
from 
the 
army 
and 
would 
certainly 
write 
to 
his 
father, 
but 
that 
the
longer 
he 
stayed 
now 
the 
more 
embittered 
their 
differences 
would 
become.

"Good-by, 
Andrew! 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Pe553SwJMI.html">Remember</a> 
that 
misfortunes 
come 
from 
God, 
and 
men 
are
never 
to 
blame," 
were 
the 
last 
words 
he 
heard 
from 
his 
sister 
when 
he
took 
leave 
of 
her.

"Then 
it 
must 
be 
so!" 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew 
as 
he 
drove 
out 
of 
the
avenue 
from 
the 
house 
at 
Bald 
Hills. 
"She, 
poor 
innocent 
creature,
