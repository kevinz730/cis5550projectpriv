imprisonment, 
but 
even 
grew 
in
strength 
as 
the 
hardships 
of 
his 
position 
increased.

That 
feeling 
of 
alertness 
and 
of 
readiness 
for 
anything 
was 
still
further 
strengthened 
in 
him 
by 
the 
high 
opinion 
his 
fellow 
prisoners
formed 
of 
him 
soon 
after 
his 
arrival 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jM5rhMF4uR8.html">at</a> 
the 
shed. 
With 
his 
knowledge
of 
languages, 
the 
respect 
shown 
him 
by 
the 
French, 
his 
simplicity, 
his
readiness 
to 
give 
anything 
asked 
of 
him 
(he 
received 
the 
allowance
of 
three 
rubles 
a 
week 
made 
to 
officers); 
with 
his 
strength, 
which 
he
showed 
to 
the 
soldiers 
by 
pressing 
nails 
into 
the 
walls 
of 
the 
hut; 
his
gentleness 
to 
his 
companions, 
and 
his 
capacity 
for 
sitting 
still 
and
thinking 
without 
doing 
anything 
(which 
seemed 
to 
them 
incomprehensible),
he 
appeared 
to 
them 
a 
rather 
mysterious 
and 
superior 
being. 
The 
very
qualities 
that 
had 
been 
a 
hindrance, 
if 
not 
actually 
harmful, 
to 
him 
in
the 
world 
he 
had 
lived 
in-his 
strength, 
his 
disdain 
for 
the 
comforts 
of
life, 
his 
absent-mindedness 
and 
simplicity-here 
among 
these 
people 
gave
him 
almost 
the 
status 
of 
a 
hero. 
And 
Pierre 
felt 
that 
their 
opinion
placed 
responsibilities 
upon 
him.





CHAPTER 
XIII

The 
French 
evacuation 
began 
on 
the 
night 
between 
the 
sixth 
and 
seventh
of 
October: 
kitchens 
and 
sheds<p>
were 
dismantled, 
carts 
loaded, 
and 
troops
and 
baggage 
trains 
started.

At 
seven 
in 
the 
morning 
a 
French 
convoy 
in 
marching 
trim, 
wearing 
shakos
and 
carrying 
muskets, 
knapsacks, 
and 
enormous 
sacks, 
stood 
in 
front
of 
the 
sheds, 
and 
animated 
French 
talk 
mingled 
with 
curses 
sounded 
all
along 
the 
lines.

In 
the 
shed 
everyone 
was 
ready, 
dressed, 
belted, 
shod, 
and 
only 
awaited
the 
order 
to 
start. 
The 
sick 
soldier, 
Sokolov, 
pale 
and 
thin 
with<p>
dark
shadows 
round 
his 
eyes, 
alone 
sat 
in<p>
his 
place<p>
barefoot 
and 
not 
dressed.
His 
eyes, 
prominent 
from 
the 
emaciation 
of 
his 
face, 
gazed 
inquiringly
at 
his 
comrades 
who 
were 
paying 
no 
attention 
to 
him, 
and 
he 
moaned
regularly 
and 
quietly. 
It 
was 
evidently 
not 
so 
much 
his 
sufferings 
that
caused 
him 
to 
moan 
(he 
had 
dysentery) 
as 
his 
fear 
and 
grief 
at 
being
left 
alone.

Pierre, 
girt<p>
with 
a 
rope 
round 
his 
waist 
and 
wearing 
shoes 
Karataev 
had
made 
for 
him 
from 
some 
leather 
a 
French 
soldier 
had 
torn 
off 
a 
tea 
chest
and 
brought 
to 
have 
his 
boots 
mended 
with, 
went 
up 
to 
the 
sick 
man 
and
squatted 
down 
beside 
him.

"You 
know, 
Sokolov, 
they 
are 
not 
all 
going 
away!<p>
They 
have 
a 
hospital
here. 
You 
may 
be<p>
better 
off 
than 
we 
others," 
said 
Pierre.

"O 
Lord! 
Oh, 
it 
will 
be 
the 
death 
of 
me! 
O 
Lord!" 
moaned 
the 
man 
in 
a
louder 
voice.

"I'll 
go 
and 
ask 
them 
again 
directly," 
said 
Pierre, 
rising 
and 
going 
to
the 
door 
of 
the 
shed.

Just 
as 
Pierre 
reached 
the 
door, 
the 
corporal 
who 
had 
offered 
him 
a
pipe 
the 
day 
before 
came 
up 
to 
it 
with 
two 
soldiers.

corporal
