rode 
by.

Prince 
Andrew, 
having 
reached 
the 
front 
line, 
rode 
along 
it. 
Our 
front
line 
and 
that 
of 
the 
enemy 
were 
far 
apart 
on 
the 
right 
and 
left 
flanks,
but 
in 
the 
center 
where 
the 
men 
with 
a 
flag 
of 
truce 
had 
passed 
that
morning, 
the 
lines 
were 
so 
near 
together 
that 
the 
men 
could 
see 
one
another's 
faces 
and 
speak 
to 
one 
another. 
Besides 
the 
soldiers 
who
formed 
the 
picket 
line 
on 
either 
side, 
there 
were 
many 
curious 
onlookers
who, 
jesting 
and 
laughing, 
stared<p>
at 
their 
strange 
foreign 
enemies.

Since 
early 
morning-despite 
an 
injunction 
not 
to 
approach 
the 
picket
line-the 
officers 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
keep 
sight-seers 
away. 
The
soldiers 
forming 
the 
picket 
line, 
like 
showmen 
exhibiting 
a 
curiosity,
no 
longer 
looked 
at 
the 
French 
but 
paid 
attention 
to 
the 
sight-seers 
and
grew 
weary 
waiting 
to 
be 
relieved. 
Prince 
Andrew 
halted 
to 
have 
a 
look
at 
the 
French.

"Look! 
Look 
there!" 
one 
soldier 
was 
saying 
to 
another, 
pointing 
to 
a
Russian 
musketeer 
who 
had 
gone 
up 
to 
the 
picket 
line 
with 
an 
officer 
and
was 
rapidly 
and 
excitedly 
talking 
to 
a 
French 
grenadier. 
"Hark 
to 
him
jabbering! 
Fine, 
isn't 
it? 
It's 
all 
the 
Frenchy 
can 
do 
to 
<a href="/aVzUge/bfW6Gj0w8.html">keep</a> 
up
with 
him. 
There 
now, 
Sidorov!"

"Wait 
a 
bit 
and 
listen. 
It's 
fine!" 
answered 
Sidorov, 
who 
was
considered 
an 
adept 
at 
French.

The 
soldier 
to 
whom 
the 
laughers 
referred 
was 
Dolokhov. 
Prince 
Andrew
recognized 
him 
and 
stopped 
to 
listen 
to 
what 
he 
was<p>
saying. 
Dolokhov
had 
come 
from 
the 
left 
flank 
where 
their 
regiment 
was 
stationed, 
with
his 
captain.

"Now 
then, 
go 
on, 
go 
on!" 
incited 
the 
officer, 
bending 
forward 
and
trying 
not 
to 
lose 
a 
word 
of 
the 
speech 
which 
was 
incomprehensible 
to
him. 
"More, 
please: 
more! 
What's 
he 
saying?"

Dolokhov 
did 
not 
answer 
the 
captain; 
he 
had 
been 
drawn 
into 
a 
hot
dispute 
with 
the 
French 
grenadier. 
They 
were 
naturally 
talking 
about 
the
campaign. 
The 
Frenchman, 
confusing 
the 
Austrians 
with 
the 
Russians, 
was
trying 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
Russians 
had 
surrendered 
and 
had 
fled 
all
the 
way 
from 
Ulm, 
while 
Dolokhov 
maintained 
that 
the 
Russians 
had 
not
surrendered 
but 
had 
beaten 
the 
French.

"We 
have 
orders 
to 
drive 
you 
off 
here, 
and 
we 
shall 
drive 
you 
off,"
said 
Dolokhov.

"Only 
take 
care 
you 
and 
your 
Cossacks 
are 
not 
all 
captured!" 
said
the 
French 
grenadier.

The 
French 
onlookers 
and 
listeners 
laughed.

"We'll 
make 
you 
dance 
as 
we 
did 
under 
Suvorov...," 
* 
said
Dolokhov.

 
 
 
 
* 
"On 
vous 
fera 
danser."


"Qu' 
est-ce 
qu'il 
chante?" 
* 
asked 
a 
Frenchman.

 
 
 
 
* 
"What's 
he 
singing 
about?"


"It's 
ancient 
history," 
said 
another, 
guessing 
that 
it 
referred 
<a href="/aVzUge/rw7m8bju5FWU.html">to
a</a> 
former 
war. 
"The 
Emperor<p>
will 
teach 
your 
Suvara 
as 
he 
has 
taught 
the
others..."

"Bonaparte..." 
began 
Dolokhov, 
but 
the 
Frenchman 
interrupted 
him.

"Not 
Bonaparte. 
He 
is 
the 
Emperor! 
Sacre 
nom...!" 
cried 
he 
angrily.

"The 
devil 
skin 
your 
Emperor."

And 
Dolokhov 
swore 
at 
him 
in 
coarse 
soldier's<p>
Russian 
and 
shouldering
his 
musket 
walked 
away.

"Let 
us 
go, 
Ivan 
Lukich," 
he 
said 
to<p>
the 
captain.

"Ah, 
that's 
the 
way 
to 
talk 
French," 
said 
the 
picket 
soldiers.
"Now, 
Sidorov, 
you 
have 
a 
try!"

Sidorov, 
turning 
to 
the 
French, 
winked, 
and 
began 
to 
jabber 
meaningless
sounds 
very 
fast: 
"Kari, 
mala, 
tafa, 
safi, 
muter, 
Kaska," 
he 
said,
trying 
to 
give 
an 
expressive 
intonation 
to 
his 
voice.

"Ho! 
ho! 
ho! 
Ha! 
ha! 
ha! 
ha! 
Ouh! 
ouh!" 
came 
peals 
of 
such 
healthy
and 
good-humored 
laughter 
from 
<a href="/aVzUge/lnA2Q68tvrb.html">the</a> 
soldiers 
that 
it 
infected 
the 
French
involuntarily, 
so 
much 
so 
that 
the 
only 
thing 
left 
to 
do 
seemed 
to 
be
to 
unload 
the 
muskets, 
explode 
the 
ammunition, 
and 
all 
return 
home 
as
quickly 
as 
possible.

But 
the 
guns 
remained 
loaded, 
the 
loopholes 
in 
blockhouses 
and
entrenchments 
looked 
out 
just 
as 
menacingly, 
and 
the 
unlimbered 
cannon
confronted 
one 
another 
as 
before.
