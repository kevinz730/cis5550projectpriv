the 
great 
balloon 
Leppich 
was 
constructing 
to 
destroy 
the 
foe,
and 
a 
trial 
balloon 
that 
was 
to 
go 
up 
next 
day. 
The 
balloon 
was 
not 
yet
ready, 
but 
Pierre 
learned 
that 
it 
was 
being 
constructed 
by 
the 
Emperor's
desire. 
The 
Emperor 
had 
written 
to 
Count 
Rostopchin 
as 
follows:

As 
soon 
as 
Leppich 
is 
ready, 
get 
together 
a 
crew 
of 
reliable 
and
intelligent 
men 
for 
his 
car 
and 
send 
a 
courier 
to 
General 
Kutuzov 
to 
let
him 
know. 
I 
have<p>
informed 
him 
of 
the 
matter.

Please 
impress 
upon 
Leppich 
to 
be 
very 
careful 
where 
he 
descends 
for
the 
first 
time, 
that 
he 
may 
not 
make 
a 
mistake 
and 
fall 
into 
the 
enemy's
hands. 
It 
is 
essential 
for 
him 
to 
combine 
his 
movements 
with 
those 
of
the 
commander 
in 
chief.


On 
his 
way<p>
home 
from 
Vorontsovo, 
as 
he 
was 
passing 
the 
Bolotnoe 
Place
Pierre, 
seeing 
a 
large 
crowd 
round 
the 
Lobnoe 
Place, 
stopped 
and 
got 
out
of 
his 
trap. 
A 
French 
cook 
accused 
of 
being 
a 
spy 
was 
being 
flogged. 
The
flogging 
was 
only 
just 
over, 
and 
the 
executioner 
was 
releasing 
from 
the
flogging 
bench 
a 
stout 
man 
with 
red 
whiskers, 
in 
blue 
stockings 
and
a 
green 
jacket, 
who 
was 
moaning 
piteously. 
Another 
criminal, 
thin 
and
pale, 
stood 
near. 
Judging 
by 
their 
faces 
they 
were 
both 
Frenchmen. 
With
a<p>
frightened 
and 
suffering 
look 
resembling 
that 
on 
the 
thin 
Frenchman's
face, 
Pierre 
pushed 
his 
way 
in 
through 
the 
crowd.

"What 
is 
it? 
Who 
is 
it? 
What 
is 
it 
for?" 
he 
kept 
asking.

But 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
crowd-officials, 
burghers, 
shopkeepers,
peasants, 
and 
women 
in 
cloaks 
and 
in 
pelisses-was 
so 
eagerly 
centered 
on
what 
was 
passing 
in 
Lobnoe 
Place 
that 
no 
one 
answered 
him. 
The 
stout 
man
rose, 
frowned, 
shrugged 
his 
shoulders, 
and 
evidently 
trying 
to 
appear
firm 
began 
to 
pull 
on 
his 
jacket 
without 
looking 
about 
him, 
but 
suddenly
his 
lips 
trembled 
and 
he 
began 
to 
cry, 
in 
the 
way 
full-blooded<p>
grown-up
men 
cry, 
though 
angry 
with 
himself 
for 
doing 
so. 
In 
the 
crowd
