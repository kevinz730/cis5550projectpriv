Nicholas 
and 
Natasha, 
arousing</h1>in 
them 
the 
same 
kind 
of
sober 
mirth 
as 
radiated<p>
from 
Anisya 
Fedorovna's 
whole<p>
being.<p>
Anisya
Fedorovna 
flushed, 
and 
drawing 
her 
kerchief 
over 
her 
face 
went 
laughing
out 
of 
the 
room. 
"Uncle" 
continued 
to 
play 
correctly, 
carefully,
with 
energetic 
firmness, 
<a href="/aVzUge/GZb4mEX0cLYU3mSaQt.html">looking</a> 
with 
a 
changed 
and 
inspired 
expression
at 
the 
spot 
where 
Anisya 
Fedorovna 
had 
just 
stood. 
Something 
seemed 
to
be 
laughing 
a 
little 
on 
one 
side 
of 
his 
face 
under 
his 
gray 
mustaches,
especially 
as 
the 
song 
grew 
brisker 
and 
the 
time 
quicker 
and 
when, 
here
and 
there, 
as 
he 
ran 
his 
fingers 
over 
the 
strings, 
something 
seemed 
to
snap.

"Lovely, 
lovely! 
Go 
on, 
Uncle, 
go 
on!" 
shouted 
Natasha 
as 
soon 
as
he 
had 
finished. 
She 
jumped 
up 
and 
hugged 
and 
kissed 
him. 
"Nicholas,
Nicholas!" 
she 
said, 
turning 
to 
her 
brother, 
as 
if 
asking 
him: 
"What
is 
it 
moves 
me 
so?"

Nicholas 
too 
was 
greatly 
pleased 
by 
"Uncle's" 
playing, 
and
"Uncle" 
played 
the 
piece 
over 
again. 
Anisya 
Fedorovna's 
smiling
face 
reappeared 
in 
the 
doorway 
and 
behind 
hers 
other 
faces...

 
 
 
 
Fetching 
water 
clear 
and<p>
sweet,
 
 
 
 
Stop, 
dear 
maiden, 
I 
entreat-

played 
"Uncle" 
once 
more, 
running 
his 
fingers 
skillfully 
<a href="/cZl/zc42jct.html">over</a> 
the
strings, 
and 
then 
he 
stopped 
short 
and 
jerked 
his 
shoulders.

"Go 
on, 
Uncle 
dear," 
Natasha 
wailed 
in 
an 
imploring 
tone 
as 
if 
her
life 
depended 
on 
it.

"Uncle" 
rose, 
and 
it 
was 
as 
if 
there 
were 
two<p>
men 
in 
him: 
one 
of
them 
smiled 
seriously 
at 
the 
merry 
fellow, 
while 
the 
merry 
fellow 
struck
a 
naive 
and 
precise 
attitude 
preparatory 
to 
a 
folk 
dance.
