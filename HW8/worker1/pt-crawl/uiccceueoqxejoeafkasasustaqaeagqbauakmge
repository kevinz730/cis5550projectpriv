abruptly.

"Quite 
beside 
themselves, 
Yakov 
Alpatych; 
they've 
fetched 
another
barrel."

"Well, 
then, 
listen! 
I'll 
go 
to 
the 
police 
officer, 
and 
you 
tell 
them
so, 
and 
that 
they 
must 
stop 
this 
and 
the 
carts 
must 
be 
got 
ready."

"I 
understand."

Alpatych 
did 
not 
insist 
further. 
He 
had 
managed 
people 
for 
a 
long 
time
and 
knew 
that 
the 
chief 
way 
to 
make 
them 
obey 
is 
to 
show 
no 
suspicion
that 
they 
can 
<a href="/cZl/mr5byQW9EbhW2vxtj.html">possibly</a> 
disobey. 
Having 
wrung 
a 
submissive 
"I 
understand"
from 
Dron, 
Alpatych 
contented 
himself 
with 
that, 
though 
he 
not 
only
doubted 
but 
felt 
almost 
certain 
that 
without 
the 
help 
of 
troops 
the
carts 
would 
not 
be 
forthcoming.

And 
so 
it 
was, 
for 
when 
evening 
came 
no 
carts 
had 
been 
provided. 
In 
the
village, 
outside 
the 
drink 
shop, 
another 
meeting 
was 
being 
held, 
which
decided 
that 
the 
horses 
should 
be 
driven 
out 
into 
the 
woods 
and 
the
carts 
should 
not 
be 
provided. 
<a href="/cZl/NP1U7mfcn2KSVyY.html">Without</a> 
saying 
anything 
of 
this 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/AXs4UJpiB1VEt9Im.html">to</a> 
the
princess, 
Alpatych 
had 
his 
own 
belongings 
taken 
out 
of 
the 
carts 
which
had 
arrived 
from 
Bald 
Hills 
<a href="/cZl/gAh6wKMFq6G5NtgpO.html">and</a> 
had 
those 
horses 
got

the

the 
police
authorities.





CHAPTER 
X

After 
her 
father's 
funeral 
Princess 
Mary 
shut 
herself 
up 
in<p>
her 
room 
and
did 
not 
admit 
anyone. 
A 
maid 
came 
to 
the 
door 
to 
say 
that 
Alpatych 
was
asking 
for 
orders 
about 
their 
departure. 
(This 
was 
before 
his 
talk 
with
Dron.) 
Princess 
Mary 
raised 
herself 
on 
the 
sofa 
on 
which 
she 
had 
been
lying 
and 
replied 
through 
the 
closed 
door 
that 
she 
did 
not 
mean 
to<p>
go
away 
and 
begged 
to 
be 
left 
in 
peace.

The 
windows 
of 
the 
room 
in 
which 
she 
was 
lying 
looked 
westward. 
She
lay 
on 
the 
sofa 
with 
her 
face 
to 
the 
wall, 
fingering 
the 
buttons<p>
of 
the
leather 
cushion 
and 
seeing 
nothing 
but 
that 
cushion, 
and 
her 
confused
thoughts 
were 
centered 
on 
one 
subject-the 
irrevocability 
of 
death 
and
her 
own 
spiritual 
baseness, 
which 
she 
had 
not 
suspected, 
but 
which 
had
shown 
itself 
during 
her 
father's 
illness. 
She 
wished 
to 
pray 
but 
did 
not
dare 
to, 
dared 
not 
in 
her 
present 
state 
of 
mind 
address 
herself 
to 
God.
She 
lay 
for 
a 
long 
time 
in 
that 
position.

The 
sun 
had 
reached 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
house, 
and 
its 
slanting 
rays
shone 
into 
the 
open 
window, 
lighting 
up 
the 
room 
and 
part<p>
of 
the 
morocco
cushion 
at 
which 
Princess 
Mary 
was 
looking. 
The 
flow 
of 
her 
thoughts
suddenly 
stopped. 
Unconsciously 
she
