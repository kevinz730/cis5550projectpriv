"The 
soul 
is
immortal-well 
then, 
if 
I 
shall 
always 
live 
I 
must 
have 
lived 
before,

remarked 
Dimmler,
who 
had 
joined 
the 
young 
folk 
with 
a 
mildly

smile 
but 
now
spoke 
as 
quietly 
and 
seriously

they.

"Why 
is

hard 
to 
imagine

Natasha. 
"It 
is

it 
will 
be 
tomorrow,

they 
heard 
the
countess 
say. 
"Why 
are 
you 
sitting 
there 
like 
conspirators?"

"Mamma, 
I 
don't

replied 
Natasha, 
but 
all 
the
same 
she 
rose.
