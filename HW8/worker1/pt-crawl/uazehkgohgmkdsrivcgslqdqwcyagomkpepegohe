from 
some 
leather</h1>a 
French 
soldier 
had 
torn 
off 
a 
tea 
chest
and 
brought 
to 
have 
his 
boots 
mended 
with, 
went 
up 
to 
the 
sick 
man 
and
squatted 
down 
beside 
him.

"You 
know, 
Sokolov, 
they 
are<p>
<a href="/cZl/SE5HI7VWVhi6iGjCy.html">not</a> 
all 
going 
away! 
They 
have 
a 
hospital
here. 
You 
may 
be 
better 
off<p>
than 
we 
others," 
said 
Pierre.

"O 
Lord! 
Oh, 
it 
will 
be 
the 
death 
of<p>
me! 
O 
Lord!" 
moaned 
the 
man 
in 
a
louder 
voice.

"I'll 
go 
and 
ask 
them 
again 
directly," 
said 
Pierre, 
rising 
and 
going 
to
the 
door 
of 
the 
shed.

Just 
as 
Pierre 
reached 
the 
door, 
the 
corporal 
who 
had 
offered 
him 
a
pipe 
the 
day 
before 
came 
up 
to 
it 
with 
two 
soldiers. 
The 
corporal 
and
soldiers 
were 
in 
marching 
kit 
with 
knapsacks 
and 
shakos 
that 
had 
metal
straps, 
and 
these 
changed 
their 
familiar 
faces.

The 
corporal 
came, 
according 
to 
orders, 
to 
shut 
the 
door. 
The 
prisoners
had 
to 
be 
counted 
before 
being 
let 
out.

"Corporal, 
what 
will 
they 
do 
with 
the 
sick 
man?..." 
Pierre 
began.

But 
even 
as 
he 
spoke 
he 
began 
to 
doubt 
whether 
this 
was 
the 
corporal
he 
knew 
or 
a 
stranger, 
so 
unlike 
himself 
did 
the 
corporal 
seem 
at 
that
moment. 
Moreover, 
just 
as 
Pierre 
was 
speaking 
a 
sharp 
rattle 
of 
drums
was 
suddenly 
heard 
from 
both 
sides. 
The 
corporal 
frowned 
at 
Pierre's
words 
and, 
uttering 
some 
meaningless 
oaths, 
slammed 
the 
door. 
The 
shed
became 
semidark, 
and 
the 
sharp 
rattle 
of 
the 
drums 
on 
two 
sides 
drowned
the 
sick 
man's 
groans.

"There 
it 
is!... 
It 
again!..." 
said 
Pierre 
to 
himself, 
and 
an
involuntary 
shudder 
ran 
down 
his 
spine. 
In 
the 
corporal's 
changed 
face,
in 
the 
sound 
of 
his 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Uc7hOZs5W6Mm.html">voice,</a> 
in 
the 
stirring 
and 
deafening 
noise 
of 
the
drums, 
he 
recognized 
that 
mysterious, 
callous 
force 
which 
compelled
people 
against 
their 
will 
to 
kill 
their 
fellow 
men-that 
force 
the 
effect
of 
which 
he 
had 
witnessed 
during 
the 
executions. 
To 
fear 
or<p>
to 
try 
to
escape 
that 
force, 
to 
address 
entreaties 
or 
exhortations 
to 
those 
who
served 
as 
its 
tools, 
was 
useless. 
Pierre 
knew 
this 
now. 
One 
had 
to 
wait
and 
endure. 
He 
did 
not 
again 
go 
to 
the 
sick 
man, 
nor 
turn 
to 
look 
at
him, 
but 
stood 
frowning 
by<p>
the 
door 
of 
the 
hut.

When 
that 
door 
was 
opened 
and 
the 
prisoners, 
crowding 
against 
one
another 
like 
a 
flock 
of 
sheep, 
squeezed 
into 
the 
exit, 
Pierre 
pushed
his 
way 
forward 
and 
approached 
that 
very 
captain 
who 
as<p>
the 
corporal 
had
assured 
him 
was 
ready 
to 
do 
anything 
for 
him. 
The 
captain 
was 
also 
in
marching 
kit, 
and 
on 
his 
cold 
face 
appeared 
that 
same 
it 
which 
Pierre
had 
recognized 
in 
the 
corporal's 
words 
and 
in 
the 
roll 
of 
the 
drums.

"Pass 
on, 
pass 
on!" 
the 
captain 
reiterated, 
frowning 
sternly, 
and
looking 
at 
the 
prisoners 
who 
thronged 
past 
him.

Pierre 
went 
up 
to 
him, 
though 
he 
knew 
his 
attempt 
would 
be 
vain.

"What 
now?" 
the 
officer 
asked 
with 
a 
cold 
look 
as 
if 
not 
recognizing
Pierre.

Pierre 
told 
him 
about 
the 
sick 
man.

"He'll 
manage 
to 
walk, 
devil 
take 
him!" 
said 
the 
captain. 
"Pass 
on, 
pass
on!" 
he 
continued 
without 
looking 
at 
Pierre.

"But 
he 
is 
dying," 
Pierre 
again 
began.

"Be 
so 
good..." 
shouted 
the 
captain, 
frowning 
angrily.

"Dram-da-da-dam, 
dam-dam..." 
rattled 
the 
drums, 
and 
Pierre 
understood
that 
this 
<a href="/aVzUge/Gd2ioN4Kzb7qLBzM.html">mysterious</a> 
force 
completely 
controlled 
these 
men 
and 
that 
it
was 
now 
useless 
to 
say 
any 
<a href="/cZl/XT9mDKi0HwD5ogArh.html">more.

The</a> 
officer 
prisoners 
were 
separated 
from 
the 
soldiers 
and 
told 
to 
march
in 
front. 
There 
were 
about 
thirty 
officers, 
with 
Pierre 
among 
them, 
and
about 
three 
hundred<p>
men.

The 
officers, 
who 
had 
come 
from 
the 
other 
sheds, 
were 
all<p>
strangers 
to
Pierre 
and 
much 
better
