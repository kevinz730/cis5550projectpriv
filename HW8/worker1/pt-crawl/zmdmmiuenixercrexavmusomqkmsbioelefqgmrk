CHAPTER 
XIV

Through 
the 
cross 
streets 
of 
the 
Khamovniki 
quarter 
the 
prisoners
marched, 
followed 
only 
by 
their 
escort 
and 
the 
vehicles 
and 
wagons
belonging 
to 
that 
escort, 
but 
when 
they 
reached 
the 
supply 
stores 
they
came 
among 
a 
huge 
and 
closely 
packed 
train 
of 
artillery 
mingled 
with
private 
vehicles.

At 
the 
bridge 
they 
all 
halted, 
waiting 
for 
those 
in 
front 
to 
get 
across.
From 
the 
bridge 
they 
had 
a 
view 
of 
endless 
lines 
of 
moving 
baggage
trains 
before 
and 
behind 
them. 
To 
the 
right, 
where 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
turns
near 
Neskuchny, 
endless 
rows 
of 
troops 
and 
carts 
stretched 
away 
into
the 
distance. 
These 
were 
troops 
of 
Beauharnais' 
corps 
which 
had 
started
before 
any 
of 
the 
others. 
Behind, 
along 
the 
riverside 
and 
across 
the
Stone 
Bridge, 
were 
Ney's 
troops 
and 
transport.

Davout's<p>
troops, 
in 
whose 
charge 
were 
the 
prisoners, 
were 
crossing 
the
Crimean 
bridge 
and 
some 
were 
already 
debouching 
into 
the 
Kaluga 
road.
But 
the 
baggage 
trains 
stretched 
out 
so 
that 
the 
last 
of 
Beauharnais'
train 
had 
not 
yet 
got 
out 
of 
Moscow 
and 
reached 
the<p>
Kaluga 
road 
when
the 
vanguard 
of 
Ney's 
army 
was 
already 
emerging 
from 
the 
Great 
Ordynka
Street.

When 
they 
had 
crossed 
the 
Crimean 
bridge 
the 
prisoners 
moved<p>
a 
few 
steps
forward, 
halted, 
and 
again 
moved 
on, 
and 
from 
all 
sides 
vehicles 
and
