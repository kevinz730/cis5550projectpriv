There 
were</h1>only 
thoughts 
clearly 
expressed 
in 
words, 
thoughts 
that
someone 
was 
uttering 
or 
that 
he 
himself 
was 
formulating.

Afterwards 
when 
he 
recalled 
those 
thoughts 
Pierre 
was 
convinced 
that
someone 
outside 
himself 
had 
spoken 
them, 
though 
the 
impressions 
of 
that
day 
had 
evoked 
them. 
He 
had 
never, 
it 
seemed 
to 
him, 
been 
able 
to 
think
and 
express 
his 
thoughts 
like 
that 
when 
awake.

"To 
endure 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/na1l2Eh2zNkID.html">war</a> 
is 
the 
most 
difficult 
subordination 
of 
man's 
freedom 
to
the 
law 
of 
God," 
the 
voice 
had 
said. 
"Simplicity 
is 
submission 
to 
the
will 
of 
God; 
you 
cannot 
escape 
from 
Him. 
And 
they 
are 
simple. 
They 
do
not 
talk, 
but 
act. 
The 
spoken 
word 
is 
silver 
but 
the 
unspoken 
is 
golden.
Man 
can 
be 
master 
of 
nothing 
while 
he 
fears 
death, 
but 
he 
who 
does 
not
fear 
it 
possesses 
all. 
If 
there 
were 
no 
suffering, 
man 
would 
not 
know
his 
limitations, 
would 
not 
know 
himself. 
The 
hardest 
thing 
(Pierre 
went
on 
thinking, 
or 
hearing, 
in 
his 
dream) 
is 
to 
be 
able 
in 
your 
soul 
to
unite 
the 
meaning 
of 
all. 
To 
unite 
all?" 
he 
asked 
himself. 
"No, 
not
to 
unite. 
Thoughts 
cannot 
be 
united, 
but 
to 
harness 
all 
these 
thoughts
together 
is 
what 
we 
need! 
Yes, 
one 
must 
harness 
them, 
must 
harness
them!" 
he 
repeated 
to 
himself 
with 
inward 
rapture, 
feeling 
that 
these
words 
and 
they 
alone 
expressed 
what 
he 
wanted 
to 
say 
and 
solved 
the
question 
that 
tormented 
him.

"Yes, 
one 
must<p>
harness, 
it 
is<p>
time 
to 
harness."

"Time 
to 
harness, 
time 
to 
harness, 
your 
excellency! 
Your 
excellency!"
some 
voice 
was 
repeating. 
"We 
must 
harness, 
it 
is 
time 
to 
harness...."

It 
was 
the 
voice 
of 
the 
groom, 
trying 
to 
wake 
him. 
The 
sun 
shone
straight 
into 
Pierre's 
face. 
He 
glanced 
at 
the 
dirty 
innyard 
in 
the
middle 
of 
which 
soldiers 
were 
watering 
their 
lean 
horses 
at 
the 
pump
while 
carts 
were 
passing 
out 
of 
the 
gate. 
Pierre 
turned 
away 
with
repugnance, 
and 
closing 
his 
eyes 
quickly 
fell 
back 
on 
the 
carriage 
seat.
"No, 
I 
don't 
want 
that, 
I 
don't 
want 
to 
see 
and 
understand 
that. 
I 
want
to 
understand 
what 
was 
revealing 
itself 
to 
me 
<a href="/aVzUge/bh1zNkID7Gmw.html">in</a> 
my 
dream. 
One 
second
more 
and 
I 
should 
have 
understood 
it 
all! 
But 
what 
am 
I 
to 
do? 
Harness,
but 
how 
can 
I 
harness 
everything?" 
and 
Pierre 
felt 
with 
horror 
that 
the
meaning 
of 
all 
he 
had 
seen 
and 
thought 
in 
the 
dream 
had 
been 
destroyed.

The 
groom,<p>
the 
coachman, 
and 
the 
innkeeper 
told 
Pierre 
that 
an 
officer
had 
come 
with 
news 
that 
the 
French 
were 
already 
near 
Mozhaysk 
and 
that
our 
men 
were 
leaving 
it.

Pierre 
got 
up 
and, 
having 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ro24om6yYzh.html">told</a> 
them 
to 
harness 
and 
overtake 
him, 
went 
on
foot 
through 
the 
town.

The 
troops 
were 
moving 
on, 
leaving 
about 
ten 
thousand 
wounded 
behind
them. 
There 
were 
wounded 
in 
the 
yards, 
at 
the 
windows 
of 
the 
houses, 
and
the 
streets 
were 
crowded 
with 
them. 
In 
the 
streets, 
around 
carts 
that
were 
to 
take 
some 
of 
the 
wounded 
away, 
shouts, 
curses, 
and 
blows 
could
be 
heard. 
Pierre<p>
offered 
the 
use 
of 
his 
carriage, 
which 
had 
overtaken
him, 
to 
a 
wounded 
general 
he 
knew, 
and 
drove 
with 
him 
to 
Moscow. 
On 
the
way 
Pierre 
was 
told 
of 
the 
death 
of 
his 
brother-in-law 
Anatole 
and 
of
that 
of 
Prince 
Andrew.





CHAPTER 
X

On 
the 
thirtieth 
of 
August 
Pierre 
reached 
Moscow. 
Close 
to 
the 
gates 
of
the 
city 
he 
was 
met 
by 
Count 
Rostopchin's 
adjutant.

"We 
have 
been 
looking 
for 
you 
everywhere," 
said 
the 
adjutant. 
"The 
count
wants 
to 
see 
you 
particularly. 
He 
asks 
you 
to 
come 
to 
him 
at 
once 
on 
a
very 
important 
matter."
