Neither

CHAPTER 
VIII

Sonya's 
letter 
written 
from 
Troitsa, 
which 
had 
come 
as 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/na1l2Eh2zNkID.html">an</a> 
answer 
to
Nicholas' 
prayer, 
was 
prompted 
by 
this: 
the 
thought 
of 
getting 
Nicholas
married 
to 
an 
heiress 
occupied 
the 
old 
countess' 
mind 
more 
and 
more. 
She
knew 
that 
Sonya 
was 
the 
chief 
obstacle 
to 
this 
happening, 
and 
Sonya's
life 
in 
the 
countess' 
house 
had 
grown 
harder 
and 
harder, 
especially
after 
they 
had 
received 
a 
letter 
from 
Nicholas 
telling 
of 
his 
meeting
with 
Princess 
Mary 
in 
Bogucharovo. 
The 
countess 
let 
no 
occasion 
slip 
of
making 
humiliating 
or 
cruel 
allusions 
to 
Sonya.

But 
a 
few 
days 
before 
they 
left 
Moscow, 
moved 
and 
excited 
by 
all 
that
was 
going 
on, 
she<p>
called 
Sonya 
to 
her 
and, 
instead 
of 
reproaching 
and
making 
demands 
on 
her, 
tearfully 
implored 
her 
to 
sacrifice 
herself
and 
repay 
all 
that 
the 
family 
had 
done 
for 
her 
by 
breaking 
off 
her
engagement 
with 
Nicholas.

"I 
shall 
not 
be 
at 
peace 
till 
you 
promise 
me 
this."

Sonya 
burst 
into 
hysterical 
tears 
and 
replied 
through 
her 
sobs 
that
she 
would 
do 
anything 
and 
was 
prepared 
for 
anything, 
but 
gave 
no 
actual
promise 
and 
could 
not 
bring 
herself 
to 
decide 
to 
do 
what 
was 
demanded
of 
her. 
She 
must 
sacrifice 
herself 
for 
the 
family 
that 
had 
reared 
and
brought 
her 
up. 
To 
sacrifice 
herself 
for 
others 
was 
Sonya's 
habit. 
Her
position 
in 
the 
house 
was 
such 
that 
only 
by 
sacrifice 
could 
she 
show 
her
worth, 
and 
she 
was 
accustomed 
to 
this 
and 
loved 
doing 
it. 
But<p>
in 
all 
her
former 
acts 
of 
self-sacrifice 
she 
had 
been 
happily 
conscious
