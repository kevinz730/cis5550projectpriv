Prince 
Sergey 
is 
a 
fine 
fellow 
and
clever."

Natasha 
would 
have 
had 
no 
doubt 
as 
to 
the 
greatness 
of 
Pierre's 
idea,
but 
one 
thing 
disconcerted 
her.<p>
"Can 
a 
man 
so 
important 
and 
necessary 
to
society 
be 
also 
my 
husband? 
How 
did 
this 
happen?" 
She 
wished 
to 
express
this 
doubt 
to 
him. 
"Now 
who 
could 
decide 
whether 
he 
is 
really 
cleverer
than 
all 
the 
others?" 
she 
asked 
herself, 
and 
passed 
in 
review 
all 
those
whom 
Pierre 
most 
respected. 
Judging 
by 
what 
he 
had 
said 
there 
was 
no 
one
he 
had 
respected 
so 
highly 
as 
Platon 
Karataev.

"Do 
you 
know 
what 
I 
am 
thinking 
about?" 
she 
asked. 
"About 
Platon
Karataev. 
Would 
he 
have 
approved 
of 
you 
now, 
do 
you 
think?"

Pierre 
was 
not 
at 
all 
surprised 
at 
this 
question. 
He 
understood 
his
wife's 
line 
of 
thought.

"Platon 
Karataev?" 
he 
repeated, 
and 
pondered, 
evidently 
sincerely
trying 
to 
imagine 
Karataev's 
opinion 
on 
the 
subject. 
"He 
would 
not 
have
understood... 
yet 
perhaps 
he 
would."

"I 
love 
you 
awfully!" 
Natasha 
suddenly 
said. 
"Awfully, 
awfully!"

"No, 
he 
would 
not 
have 
approved," 
said 
Pierre, 
after 
reflection. 
"What
he 
would 
have 
approved 
of 
is 
our 
family 
life. 
He 
was 
always 
so 
anxious
to 
find 
seemliness, 
happiness, 
and 
peace 
in 
everything, 
and 
I 
should
have 
been 
proud 
to 
let 
him 
see 
us. 
There 
now-you 
talk 
of 
my 
absence,
but 
you 
wouldn't 
believe 
what 
a 
special 
feeling 
I 
have 
for 
you 
after 
a
separation...."

"Yes, 
I 
should 
think..." 
Natasha 
began.

"No, 
it's 
not 
that. 
I 
never 
leave 
off 
loving 
you. 
And 
one 
couldn't 
love
more, 
but 
this 
is 
something 
special.... 
Yes, 
of 
course-" 
he 
did 
not
finish 
because 
their<p>
eyes 
meeting 
said 
the 
rest.

"What 
nonsense 
it 
is," 
Natasha 
suddenly 
exclaimed, 
"about 
honeymoons,
and 
that 
the 
greatest 
happiness 
is 
at 
first!<p>
On 
the 
contrary, 
now 
is
the 
best 
of 
all. 
If 
only 
you 
did 
not 
go 
away! 
Do 
you 
remember 
how
we 
quarreled? 
And 
it 
was 
always 
my 
fault. 
Always 
mine. 
And 
what 
we
quarreled 
about-I 
don't 
even 
remember!"

"Always 
about 
the 
same 
thing," 
said 
Pierre 
with 
a 
smile. 
"Jealo..."

"Don't 
say 
it!<p>
I 
can't 
bear 
it!" 
Natasha 
cried, 
and 
her 
eyes 
glittered
coldly 
and 
vindictively. 
"Did 
you 
see 
her?" 
she 
added, 
after 
a 
pause.

"No, 
and 
if 
I 
had 
I 
shouldn't 
have 
recognized 
her."

They 
were 
silent 
for 
a 
while.

"Oh, 
do 
you 
know? 
While 
you 
were 
talking 
in 
the 
study 
I 
was 
looking 
at
you," 
Natasha 
began, 
evidently 
anxious 
to 
disperse 
the 
cloud 
that 
had
come 
over 
them. 
"You 
are 
as 
like 
him 
as 
two 
peas-like 
the 
boy." 
(She
meant 
her 
little 
son.) 
"Oh, 
it's 
time 
to 
go 
to 
him.... 
The 
milk's
come.... 
But 
I'm 
sorry 
to 
leave 
you."

They 
were 
silent 
for 
a 
few 
seconds. 
Then 
suddenly 
turning 
to 
one
another 
at 
the 
same 
time 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/giG6iw9DduKC8i.html">they</a> 
both 
began 
to 
speak. 
Pierre 
began 
with
self-satisfaction 
and 
enthusiasm, 
Natasha 
with 
a 
quiet, 
happy 
smile.
Having 
interrupted 
one 
another 
they 
both 
stopped 
to 
let 
the 
other
continue.

"No. 
What 
did 
you 
say? 
Go 
on, 
go 
on."

"No, 
you 
go 
on, 
I 
was 
talking 
nonsense," 
said 
Natasha.

Pierre 
finished 
what 
he 
had 
begun. 
It 
was 
the 
sequel 
to 
his 
complacent
reflections 
on 
his 
success 
in 
Petersburg. 
At 
that 
moment 
it 
seemed 
to
him 
that 
he 
was 
chosen 
to 
give 
a 
new 
direction 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
Russian
society 
and 
to 
the 
whole 
world.

"I 
only 
wished 
to 
say 
that 
ideas 
that 
have 
great 
results 
are 
always
simple 
ones. 
My 
whole 
idea 
is 
that 
if 
vicious 
people 
are 
united 
and
constitute 
a 
power, 
then 
honest 
folk 
must 
do 
the 
same. 
Now 
that's 
simple
enough."

"Yes."

"And 
what 
were 
you 
going 
to 
say?"

"I? 
Only 
nonsense."

"But 
all 
the 
same?"

"Oh 
nothing, 
only 
a 
trifle," 
said 
Natasha, 
smiling 
still 
more 
brightly.
"I 
only 
wanted 
to 
tell 
you 
about 
Petya: 
today 
nurse 
was 
coming 
to 
take
him 
from 
me, 
and 
he 
laughed, 
shut 
his 
eyes, 
and 
clung 
to 
me. 
I'm 
sure
he
