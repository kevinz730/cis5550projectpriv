the

of

Prussian 
fortresses 
had<p>
been

when 
our

with 
Napoleon
was 
beginning, 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
gave 
one 
of 
her 
soirees. 
The 
"cream 
of
really 
good 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ri1suDcq8iCtOt9LZ.html">society"</a> 
consisted 
of 
the 
fascinating 
Helene, 
forsaken
by 
her 
husband, 
Mortemart, 
the 
delightful 
Prince 
Hippolyte 
who 
had
just 
<a href="/cZl/UYs4H1J3kZt.html">returned</a> 
from 
Vienna, 
two 
diplomatists, 
the 
old 
aunt, 
a 
young 
man
referred 
to 
in 
that 
drawing 
room 
as 
"a 
man 
of 
great 
merit" 
(un 
homme
de 
beaucoup 
de 
merite), 
a 
newly 
appointed 
maid 
of 
honor 
and 
her 
mother,
and 
several 
other 
less 
noteworthy 
persons.

The 
novelty 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
was 
setting 
before 
her 
guests 
that 
evening
was 
Boris 
Drubetskoy, 
who 
had 
just 
arrived 
as 
a 
special 
messenger<p>
from
the 
Prussian 
army 
and 
was 
aide-de-camp 
to 
a 
very 
important 
personage.

The 
temperature 
shown 
by 
the 
political 
thermometer 
to 
the 
company 
that
evening 
was 
this:

"Whatever 
the 
European 
sovereigns 
and 
commanders 
may 
do 
to
countenance 
Bonaparte, 
and 
to<p>
cause 
me, 
and 
us 
in 
general, 
annoyance 
and
mortification, 
our 
opinion 
of 
Bonaparte 
cannot 
alter. 
We 
shall 
not 
cease
to 
express 
our 
sincere 
views 
on 
that 
subject, 
and 
can 
only 
say 
to 
the
King 
of 
Prussia 
and 
others: 
'So 
much 
the 
worse 
for 
you. 
Tu 
l'as
voulu, 
George 
Dandin,' 
that's 
all 
we 
have 
to 
say 
about 
it!"

When 
Boris, 
who 
was 
to<p>
be 
served 
up 
to 
the 
guests, 
entered 
the 
drawing
room, 
almost 
all<p>
the 
company 
had 
assembled, 
and 
the 
conversation, 
guided
by 
Anna 
Pavlovna, 
was 
about 
our 
diplomatic 
relations 
with 
Austria 
and
the 
hope 
of 
an 
alliance 
with 
her.

Boris, 
grown 
more 
manly 
and 
looking 
fresh, 
rosy 
and 
self-possessed,
entered 
the 
drawing 
room 
elegantly 
dressed 
in<p>
the 
uniform 
of 
an
aide-de-camp 
and 
was 
duly 
conducted 
to 
pay 
his 
respects 
to 
the 
aunt 
and
then 
brought 
back 
to 
the 
general 
circle.

Anna 
Pavlovna 
gave 
him 
her 
shriveled 
hand 
to 
kiss 
and 
introduced 
him 
to
several 
persons 
whom 
he 
did 
not 
know, 
giving 
him 
a 
whispered 
description
of 
each.

"Prince 
Hippolyte 
Kuragin-charming 
young 
fellow; 
M.
Kronq,-charge 
d'affaires 
from 
Copenhagen-a 
profound 
intellect,"
and 
simply, 
"Mr. 
Shitov-a 
man 
of 
great 
merit"-this 
of 
the 
man
usually 
so 
described.

Thanks 
to 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna's 
efforts, 
his 
own 
tastes, 
and 
the
peculiarities 
of 
his 
reserved 
nature, 
Boris 
had 
managed 
during 
his
service 
to 
place 
himself 
very 
advantageously. 
He 
was 
aide-de-camp 
to 
a
very 
important 
personage, 
had 
been 
sent 
on 
a 
very 
important 
mission 
to
Prussia, 
and 
had 
just 
returned 
from 
there 
as 
a 
special 
messenger. 
He 
had
become 
thoroughly 
conversant 
with 
that 
unwritten 
code 
with 
which 
he 
had
been 
so 
pleased 
at 
Olmuetz 
and 
according 
to 
which 
an 
ensign 
might 
rank
incomparably
