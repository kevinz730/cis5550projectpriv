CHAPTER 
VI

The 
fifth 
of 
November 
was 
the 
first 
day 
of 
what 
is 
called 
the 
battle 
of
Krasnoe. 
Toward 
evening-after 
much 
disputing 
and 
many 
mistakes 
made 
by
generals 
who 
did 
not 
go 
to 
their 
proper 
places, 
and 
after 
adjutants 
had
been 
sent 
about 
with 
counterorders-when 
it 
had 
become 
plain 
that 
the
enemy 
was 
everywhere 
in 
flight 
and 
that 
there 
could 
and 
would 
be 
no
battle, 
Kutuzov 
left 
Krasnoe 
and 
went<p>
to 
Dobroe 
whither 
his 
headquarters
had 
that 
day 
been 
transferred.

The 
day 
was 
clear 
and 
frosty. 
Kutuzov 
rode 
to 
Dobroe 
on 
his 
plump 
little
white 
horse, 
followed 
by 
an 
enormous 
suite 
of 
discontented 
generals 
who
whispered 
among 
themselves 
behind 
his 
back. 
All 
along 
the 
road 
groups 
of
French 
prisoners 
captured 
that 
day 
(there 
were 
seven 
thousand 
of 
them)
were 
crowding 
to 
warm 
themselves 
at 
campfires. 
Near 
Dobroe 
an 
immense
crowd 
of 
tattered 
prisoners, 
buzzing 
with 
talk 
and 
wrapped 
and 
bandaged
in 
anything 
they 
had 
been 
able 
to 
get 
hold 
of, 
were 
standing 
in 
the 
road
beside 
a 
long 
row 
of 
unharnessed 
French 
guns. 
At 
the<p>
approach<p>
of 
the
commander 
in 
chief 
the 
buzz 
of 
talk 
ceased 
and 
all 
eyes 
were 
fixed 
on
Kutuzov 
who, 
wearing 
a<p>
white 
cap 
with 
a 
red 
band 
and 
a 
padded 
overcoat
that 
bulged 
on 
his 
round 
shoulders, 
moved 
slowly 
along 
the 
road 
on 
his
white 
horse. 
One 
of 
the 
generals 
was 
reporting 
to 
him 
where 
the 
guns 
and
prisoners 
had 
been 
captured.

Kutuzov 
seemed 
preoccupied 
and 
did 
not 
listen 
to 
what 
the 
general 
was
saying. 
He 
screwed 
up 
his 
eyes 
with 
a 
dissatisfied 
look 
as 
he 
gazed
attentively 
and 
fixedly 
at 
these 
prisoners, 
who 
presented 
a 
specially
wretched 
appearance. 
Most 
of 
them 
were 
disfigured 
by 
frost-bitten 
noses
and 
cheeks, 
and 
nearly 
all 
had 
red, 
swollen 
and 
festering 
eyes.

One 
group 
of 
the 
French 
stood 
close 
to 
the 
road, 
and 
two 
of 
them, 
one 
of
whom 
had 
his 
face 
covered 
with 
sores, 
were 
tearing 
a 
piece 
of 
raw
flesh 
with 
their 
hands. 
There 
was 
something 
horrible 
and 
bestial 
in
the 
fleeting 
glance 
they 
threw 
at 
the 
riders 
and 
in 
the 
malevolent
expression 
with 
which, 
after 
a 
glance 
at 
Kutuzov, 
the 
soldier 
with 
the
sores 
immediately 
turned 
away 
and 
went 
on 
with<p>
what 
he 
was 
doing.

Kutuzov 
looked 
long 
and 
intently 
at 
these 
two 
soldiers. 
He 
puckered 
his
face, 
screwed 
up 
his 
eyes, 
and 
pensively 
swayed 
his 
head. 
At 
another
spot 
he 
noticed 
a 
Russian 
soldier 
laughingly 
patting 
a 
Frenchman 
on 
the
shoulder, 
saying 
something 
to 
him 
in 
a 
friendly 
manner, 
and 
Kutuzov 
with
the 
same 
expression 
on 
his 
face 
again 
swayed 
his 
head.

"What 
were 
you 
saying?" 
he 
asked 
the 
general, 
who 
continuing 
his 
report
directed 
the 
commander 
in 
chief's 
attention 
to 
some 
standards 
captured
from 
the 
French 
and 
standing 
in 
front 
of 
the<p>
Preobrazhensk 
regiment.

"Ah, 
the 
standards!" 
said 
Kutuzov, 
evidently 
detaching 
himself 
with
difficulty 
from 
the 
thoughts 
that 
preoccupied 
him.

He 
looked 
about 
him 
absently. 
Thousands 
of 
eyes 
were 
looking 
at 
him 
from
all<p>
sides 
awaiting 
a 
word 
from 
him.

He 
stopped 
in 
front 
of 
the 
Preobrazhensk 
regiment, 
sighed 
deeply, 
and
closed 
his 
eyes. 
One<p>
of 
his 
suite 
beckoned 
to 
the 
soldiers 
carrying
the 
standards 
to 
advance 
and 
surround 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
with 
them.
Kutuzov 
was 
silent 
for 
a 
few 
seconds 
and
