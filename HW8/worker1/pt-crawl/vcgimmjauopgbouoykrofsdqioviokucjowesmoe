her 
marry, 
it's 
all 
the
same 
to 
me!" 
he 
screamed 
in 
the 
same 
piercing 
tone 
as 
when 
parting
from 
his 
son.

"I 
will 
tell 
you 
frankly," 
said 
Prince 
Vasili 
in 
the 
tone 
of
a 
crafty 
man 
convinced 
of 
the 
futility 
of 
being 
cunning 
with 
so
keen-sighted 
a 
companion. 
"You 
know, 
you 
see 
right 
through 
people.
Anatole 
is 
no 
genius, 
but 
he 
is 
an 
honest, 
goodhearted 
lad; 
an 
excellent
son 
or 
kinsman."

"All 
right, 
all 
right, 
we'll 
see!"

As 
always 
happens 
when 
women 
lead 
lonely 
lives 
for 
any 
length 
of 
time
without 
male 
society, 
on 
Anatole's 
appearance 
all 
the 
three 
women 
of
Prince 
Bolkonski's 
household 
felt 
that 
their 
life 
had 
not 
been 
real
till 
then. 
Their 
powers 
of 
reasoning, 
feeling, 
and 
observing 
immediately
increased 
tenfold, 
and 
their 
life, 
which 
seemed 
to 
have 
been 
passed 
in
darkness, 
was 
suddenly 
lit 
up 
by 
a 
new 
brightness, 
full 
of 
significance.

Princess 
Mary 
grew 
quite 
unconscious 
of 
<a href="/cZl/jf4H02Npkec.html">her</a> 
face 
and 
coiffure. 
The
handsome 
open 
face 
of 
the 
man 
who 
might 
perhaps 
be 
her 
husband 
absorbed
all 
her 
attention. 
He 
seemed 
to 
her 
kind, 
brave, 
determined, 
manly, 
and
magnanimous. 
She 
felt 
convinced 
of 
that. 
Thousands 
of 
dreams 
of 
a 
future
family 
life 
continually 
rose 
in 
her 
imagination. 
She 
drove 
them 
away 
and
tried 
to 
conceal 
them.

"But 
am 
I 
not 
too 
cold 
with 
him?" 
thought 
the 
princess. 
"I 
try
to 
be 
reserved 
because 
in 
the 
depth 
of 
my 
soul 
I 
feel 
<a href="/cZl/IE2S0T.html">too</a> 
near 
to 
him
already, 
but 
then 
he 
cannot<p>
know 
what 
I 
think 
of 
him 
and 
may 
imagine
that 
I 
do 
not 
like 
him."

And 
Princess 
Mary 
tried, 
but 
could 
<a href="/aVzUge/Sm637sbb.html">not</a> 
manage, 
to 
be 
cordial 
to 
her 
new
guest. 
"Poor 
girl, 
she's 
devilish 
ugly!" 
thought 
Anatole.

Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
also 
roused 
to 
great 
excitement 
by 
Anatole's
arrival, 
thought 
in 
another 
way. 
Of 
course, 
she, 
a 
handsome 
young 
woman
without 
any 
definite 
position, 
without 
relations 
or 
even 
a 
country, 
did
not 
intend 
to 
devote 
her 
life 
to 
serving 
Prince 
Bolkonski, 
to 
reading
aloud 
to 
him 
and 
being 
friends 
with 
Princess 
Mary. 
Mademoiselle
Bourienne 
had 
long 
been 
waiting 
for 
a 
Russian 
prince 
who, 
able 
to
appreciate 
at 
a 
glance 
her 
superiority
