Sidorov!"

"Wait 
a 
bit 
and 
listen.</h1>It's 
fine!" 
answered 
Sidorov, 
who 
was
considered 
an 
adept 
at 
French.

The 
soldier 
to 
whom 
the 
laughers 
referred 
was 
Dolokhov. 
Prince 
Andrew
recognized 
him 
and 
stopped 
to 
listen 
to 
what 
he 
was 
saying. 
Dolokhov
had 
come 
from 
the 
left 
flank 
where 
their 
regiment 
was<p>
stationed, 
with
his 
captain.

"Now 
then, 
go 
on, 
go 
on!" 
incited 
the 
officer, 
bending 
forward 
and
trying 
not 
to 
lose 
a 
word 
of 
the 
speech 
which 
was 
incomprehensible 
to
him. 
"More, 
please: 
more! 
What's 
he 
saying?"

Dolokhov 
did 
not 
answer 
the 
captain; 
he 
had 
been 
drawn 
into 
a 
hot
dispute 
with 
the 
French 
grenadier. 
They 
were 
naturally 
talking 
about 
the
campaign. 
The 
Frenchman, 
confusing 
the 
Austrians 
with 
the 
Russians, 
was
trying 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
Russians 
had 
surrendered 
and 
had 
fled 
all
the 
way 
from 
Ulm, 
while 
Dolokhov 
maintained 
that 
the 
Russians 
had 
not
surrendered 
but 
had 
beaten 
the 
French.

"We 
have 
orders 
to 
drive 
you 
off 
here, 
and 
we 
shall 
drive 
you 
off,"
said 
Dolokhov.

"Only 
take 
care 
you 
and 
your 
Cossacks 
are 
not 
all 
captured!" 
said
the 
French 
grenadier.

The 
French 
onlookers 
and 
listeners 
laughed.

"We'll 
make 
you 
dance 
as 
we 
did 
under 
Suvorov...," 
* 
said
Dolokhov.

<p>
 
 
 
* 
"On 
vous 
fera 
danser."


"Qu' 
est-ce 
qu'il 
chante?" 
* 
asked<p>
a 
Frenchman.

 
 
 
 
* 
"What's 
he 
singing 
about?"


"It's 
ancient 
history," 
said 
another, 
guessing 
that 
it 
referred 
to
a 
former<p>
war.
