the 
profound
course 
of 
ideas 
which 
<a href="/cZl/oz7EXJo37NPT.html">guided</a> 
his 
decisions 
merely 
gave 
them 
his 
final
conclusions 
in 
the 
form 
of 
commands. 
Having 
listened 
to 
a 
suggestion
from 
Davout, 
who 
was 
now 
called 
Prince 
d'Eckmuehl, 
to 
turn 
the 
Russian
left 
<a href="/aVzUge/LE260zSr.html">wing,</a> 
Napoleon 
said 
it 
should 
not 
be 
done, 
without 
explaining
why 
not. 
To 
a 
proposal 
made 
by 
General 
Campan 
(who 
was 
to 
attack 
the
fleches) 
to 
lead 
his 
division 
through 
the 
woods, 
Napoleon 
agreed, 
though
the 
so-called 
Duke 
of 
Elchingen 
(Ney) 
ventured 
to 
remark 
that 
a 
movement
through 
the 
woods 
was 
dangerous 
and 
might 
disorder 
the 
division.

Having 
inspected 
the 
country 
opposite 
the 
Shevardino 
Redoubt, 
Napoleon
pondered 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hI3tc2BnCGW3iLv.html">a</a> 
little 
in 
silence 
and 
then 
indicated 
the 
spots 
where 
two
batteries 
should 
be 
set 
up 
by 
the 
morrow 
to 
act 
against 
the 
Russian
entrenchments, 
and 
the 
places 
where, 
in 
line 
with 
them, 
the 
field
artillery 
should 
be 
placed.

After 
giving 
these 
and 
other 
commands 
he 
returned 
to 
his 
tent, 
and 
the
dispositions 
for 
the 
battle 
were 
written 
down 
from 
his 
dictation.

These 
dispositions, 
of 
which 
the 
French 
historians 
write 
with 
enthusiasm
and 
other 
historians 
with 
profound 
respect, 
were 
as 
follows:

At 
dawn 
the 
two 
new 
batteries 
established 
during 
the 
night 
on 
the
plain 
occupied 
by 
the 
Prince 
d'Eckmuehl 
will 
open 
fire 
on 
the 
opposing
batteries 
of 
the 
enemy.

At 
the 
same 
time 
the 
commander 
of 
the 
artillery 
of 
the 
1st 
Corps,
General 
Pernetti, 
with 
thirty 
cannon 
of 
Campan's 
division 
and 
all 
the
howitzers 
of 
Dessaix's 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Uc7hOZs5W6Mm.html">and</a><p>
Friant's 
divisions, 
will 
move 
forward, 
open
fire, 
and 
overwhelm 
with 
shellfire 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NIL9Xs90xR.html">enemy's</a> 
battery, 
against 
which
will 
operate:

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
24 
guns 
of 
the 
artillery 
of 
the 
Guards
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
30 
guns 
of 
Campan's 
division

 
and 
 
 
 
 
8 
guns 
of 
Friant's 
and 
Dessaix's 
divisions
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-

 
in 
all 
62 
guns.

The 
commander 
of 
the 
artillery 
of 
the 
3rd 
Corps, 
General 
Fouche, 
will
place 
the 
howitzers 
of 
the 
3rd 
and 
8th 
Corps, 
sixteen 
in 
all, 
on 
the
flanks 
of 
the 
battery 
that 
is 
to 
bombard 
the 
entrenchment 
on 
the 
left,
which 
will 
have 
forty 
guns<p>
in 
all 
directed<p>
against 
it.

General 
Sorbier 
must 
be 
ready 
at 
the 
first 
order 
to 
advance 
with 
all 
the
howitzers 
of 
the 
Guard's 
artillery 
against 
either 
one 
or 
other 
of 
the
entrenchments.

During 
the 
cannonade 
Prince 
Poniatowski 
is 
to 
advance 
through 
the 
wood
on 
the 
village 
and 
turn 
the 
enemy's 
position.

General 
Campan 
will 
move 
through 
the 
wood 
to 
seize 
the 
first
fortification.
