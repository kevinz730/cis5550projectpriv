Rostov 
rode</h1>up 
to
it 
and 
saw 
Telyanin's 
horse 
at 
the 
porch.

In 
the 
second 
room 
of 
the 
inn 
the 
lieutenant 
was 
sitting 
over 
a 
dish 
of
sausages 
and 
a 
bottle 
of 
wine.

"Ah, 
you've 
come 
here 
too, 
young 
man!" 
he 
said, 
smiling 
and
raising 
his 
eyebrows.

"Yes," 
said 
Rostov 
as 
if 
it 
cost 
him 
a 
great 
deal 
to 
utter 
the
word; 
and 
he 
sat<p>
down 
at 
the 
nearest 
table.

Both 
were 
silent. 
There 
were 
two 
Germans 
and 
a 
Russian 
officer 
in 
the
room. 
No 
one 
spoke 
and 
the 
only 
sounds 
heard 
were 
the 
clatter 
of 
knives
and 
the 
munching 
of 
the 
lieutenant.

When 
Telyanin 
had 
finished 
his 
lunch 
he 
took 
out 
of 
his 
pocket 
a 
double
purse 
and, 
drawing 
its 
rings 
aside 
with 
his 
small, 
white, 
turned-up
fingers, 
drew 
out 
a 
gold 
imperial, 
and 
lifting 
his 
eyebrows 
gave 
it 
to
the 
waiter.

"Please 
be 
quick," 
he 
said.

The 
coin 
was 
a 
new 
one.<p>
Rostov 
rose 
and 
went 
up 
to 
Telyanin.

"Allow 
me 
to 
look 
at 
your 
purse," 
he 
said 
in 
a 
low, 
almost
inaudible, 
voice.

With 
shifting 
eyes 
but 
eyebrows 
still 
raised, 
Telyanin 
handed 
him 
the
purse.

"Yes, 
it's 
a 
nice 
purse. 
Yes, 
yes," 
he 
said, 
growing 
suddenly
pale, 
and 
added, 
"Look 
at 
it, 
young 
man."

Rostov 
took 
the 
purse 
in<p>
his 
hand, 
examined 
it 
and 
the 
money 
in 
it, 
and
looked 
at 
Telyanin. 
The 
lieutenant 
was 
looking 
about 
in 
his 
usual 
way
and 
suddenly 
seemed 
to 
grow 
very 
merry.

"If 
we 
get 
to 
Vienna 
I'll 
get 
rid 
of 
it 
there 
but 
in 
these 
wretched
little 
towns 
there's 
nowhere 
to 
spend 
it," 
said 
he. 
"Well, 
let 
me
have 
it, 
young 
man, 
I'm 
going."

Rostov 
did 
not 
speak.

"And 
you? 
Are 
you 
going 
to 
have 
lunch 
too? 
They 
feed 
you 
quite
decently 
here," 
continued 
Telyanin. 
"Now 
then, 
let 
me 
have 
it."

He 
stretched 
out 
his 
hand 
to 
take 
hold 
of 
the 
purse. 
Rostov 
let 
go 
of
it. 
Telyanin 
took 
the 
purse 
and 
began 
carelessly 
slipping 
it 
into 
the
pocket 
of 
his 
riding 
breeches, 
with 
his 
eyebrows 
lifted 
and 
his 
mouth
slightly 
open, 
as 
if 
to 
say, 
"Yes, 
yes, 
I 
am 
putting 
my 
purse 
in 
my
pocket 
and 
that's 
quite 
simple 
and 
is 
no 
one 
else's 
business."

"Well, 
young 
man?" 
he 
said 
with 
a 
sigh, 
and 
from 
under 
his 
lifted
brows 
he 
glanced 
into 
Rostov's 
eyes.

Some 
flash 
as 
of 
an 
electric 
spark 
shot 
from 
Telyanin's 
eyes 
to
Rostov's 
and 
back, 
and 
back 
again 
and 
again 
in 
an 
instant.

"Come 
here," 
said 
Rostov, 
catching 
hold 
of 
Telyanin's 
arm 
and
almost 
dragging 
him 
to 
the 
window. 
"That 
money 
is 
Denisov's; 
you
took 
it..." 
he 
whispered 
just 
above 
Telyanin's 
ear.

"What? 
What? 
How 
dare 
you? 
What?" 
said 
Telyanin.

But 
these 
words 
came 
like 
a 
piteous, 
despairing 
cry 
and 
an 
entreaty 
for
pardon.
