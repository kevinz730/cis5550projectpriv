all,</h1>though 
<a href="/cZl/zc2eQlLW5ioN9Lpf.html">he</a> 
really 
did 
not 
understand 
anything 
of
it.

Tikhon 
Shcherbaty 
was 
one 
of 
the 
most 
indispensable 
men 
in 
their 
band.
He 
was 
a 
peasant 
from 
Pokrovsk, 
near 
the 
river 
Gzhat. 
When 
Denisov 
had
come 
<a href="/aVzUge/du3fnBp1EbhW1pAy.html">to</a> 
Pokrovsk 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
his 
operations 
and 
had 
as 
usual
summoned 
the 
village 
elder 
and 
asked 
him 
what 
he 
knew 
about 
the 
French,
the 
elder, 
as 
though 
shielding 
himself, 
had 
replied, 
as 
all 
village
elders 
did, 
that 
he 
had 
neither 
seen 
nor 
heard 
anything 
of 
them. 
But
when 
Denisov 
explained 
that 
his 
purpose 
was 
to 
kill 
the 
French, 
and
asked 
if 
no 
French 
had 
strayed 
that 
way, 
the 
elder 
replied 
that 
some
"more-orderers" 
had 
really 
been 
at 
their 
village, 
but 
that 
Tikhon
Shcherbaty 
was 
the 
only 
man 
who 
dealt 
with 
such 
matters. 
Denisov 
had
Tikhon 
called 
and, 
having 
praised 
him 
for 
his 
activity, 
said 
a 
few 
words
in 
the 
elder's 
presence 
about 
loyalty 
to 
the 
Tsar
