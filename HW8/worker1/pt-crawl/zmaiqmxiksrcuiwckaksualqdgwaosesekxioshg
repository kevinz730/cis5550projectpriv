on 
black</h1>horses, 
trotting 
straight 
toward 
him<p>
and
across 
his 
path. 
Rostov 
put 
his 
horse 
to 
full 
gallop 
to 
get<p>
out 
of 
the
way 
of 
these 
men, 
and 
he 
would 
have 
got 
clear 
had 
they 
continued 
at 
the
same 
speed, 
but 
they 
kept 
increasing 
their 
pace, 
so 
that 
some 
of 
the
horses 
were 
already 
galloping. 
Rostov 
heard 
the 
thud 
of 
their 
hoofs
and 
the 
jingle 
of 
their 
weapons 
and 
saw 
their 
horses, 
their 
figures, 
and
even 
their 
faces, 
more<p>
and 
more 
distinctly. 
They 
were 
our 
Horse 
Guards,
advancing 
to 
attack 
the 
French 
cavalry 
that 
was 
coming 
to 
meet 
them.

The 
Horse 
Guards 
were 
galloping, 
but 
still 
holding 
in 
their 
horses.
Rostov 
could 
already 
see 
their 
faces 
and 
heard 
the 
command:
"Charge!" 
shouted 
by 
an 
officer 
who 
was 
urging 
his 
thoroughbred 
to
full 
speed. 
Rostov, 
fearing 
to 
be 
crushed 
or 
swept 
into 
the 
attack 
on
the 
French,<p>
galloped 
along 
the 
front 
as 
hard 
as 
his 
horse 
could 
go, 
but
still 
was 
not 
in 
time 
to 
avoid 
them.

The 
last 
of 
the 
Horse 
Guards, 
a 
huge 
pockmarked 
fellow, 
frowned 
angrily
on 
seeing 
Rostov 
before 
him, 
with 
whom 
he 
would 
inevitably 
collide.
This 
Guardsman 
would 
certainly 
have 
bowled 
Rostov 
and 
his 
Bedouin 
over
(Rostov 
felt 
himself 
quite 
tiny 
and 
weak 
compared 
to 
these 
gigantic 
men
and 
horses) 
had 
it 
not 
occurred 
to 
Rostov 
to 
flourish 
his 
whip 
before
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
Guardsman's 
horse. 
The 
heavy 
black 
horse, 
sixteen
hands 
high, 
shied, 
throwing 
back 
its 
ears; 
but 
the 
pockmarked 
Guardsman
drove 
his 
huge 
spurs 
in 
violently, 
and 
the 
horse, 
flourishing 
its 
tail
and 
extending 
its 
neck, 
galloped 
on 
yet 
faster. 
Hardly 
had 
the 
Horse
Guards 
passed 
Rostov 
before 
he 
heard 
them 
shout, 
"Hurrah!" 
and
looking 
back 
saw 
that 
their 
foremost 
ranks 
were 
mixed 
up 
with 
some
foreign 
cavalry 
with 
red 
epaulets, 
probably 
French. 
He 
could 
see 
nothing
more, 
for 
immediately 
afterwards 
cannon 
began 
firing 
from 
somewhere 
and
smoke 
enveloped 
everything.

At 
that 
moment, 
as 
the 
Horse 
Guards, 
having 
passed 
him, 
disappeared 
in
the 
smoke, 
Rostov 
hesitated 
whether 
to 
gallop 
after 
them 
or 
to 
go<p>
where
he 
was 
sent. 
This 
was 
the 
brilliant 
charge 
of 
the 
Horse 
Guards 
that
amazed 
the 
French 
themselves. 
Rostov 
was 
horrified 
to 
hear 
later 
that
of 
all 
that 
mass 
of 
huge 
and 
handsome 
men, 
of 
all 
those 
brilliant,
rich 
youths, 
officers 
and 
cadets, 
who 
had 
galloped 
past 
him 
on 
their
thousand-ruble 
horses, 
only 
eighteen 
were 
left 
after 
the 
charge.

"Why 
should 
I 
envy 
them? 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/SN3l70yFQ.html">My</a> 
chance 
is 
not 
lost, 
and 
maybe 
I 
shall 
see
the 
Emperor 
immediately!" 
thought 
Rostov 
and 
galloped 
on.

When 
he 
came 
level 
with 
the 
Foot 
Guards 
he 
noticed 
that 
about 
them 
and
around 
them 
cannon 
balls 
were 
flying, 
of 
which 
he 
was 
aware 
not 
so
much 
because 
he 
heard 
their 
sound 
as 
because 
he 
saw 
uneasiness 
on
the 
soldiers' 
faces 
and 
unnatural 
warlike 
solemnity 
on 
those 
of 
the
officers.

Passing 
behind 
one 
of 
the 
lines 
of 
a 
regiment 
of 
Foot 
Guards 
he 
heard 
a
voice 
calling 
him 
by 
name.

"Rostov!"

"What?" 
he 
answered, 
not 
recognizing 
Boris.

"I 
say, 
we've 
been 
in 
the 
front 
line! 
Our 
regiment 
attacked!" 
said
Boris 
with 
the 
happy 
smile 
seen 
on 
the 
faces 
of 
young 
men 
who 
have 
been
under 
fire 
for 
the 
first 
time.

Rostov 
stopped.

"Have 
you?" 
he 
said. 
"Well, 
how 
did 
it 
go?"

"We 
drove 
them 
back!" 
said 
Boris 
with 
animation, 
growing 
talkative.
"Can 
you 
imagine 
it?" 
and 
he 
began 
describing 
how 
the 
Guards, 
having
taken<p>
up 
their 
position 
and 
seeing 
troops 
before 
them, 
thought 
they 
were
Austrians, 
and 
all 
at 
once
