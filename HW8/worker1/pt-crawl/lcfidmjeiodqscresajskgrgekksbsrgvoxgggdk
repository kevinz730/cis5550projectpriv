Mary, 
that 
in 
spite 
of</h1>his 
extreme 
youth 
his 
departure 
for
the 
army 
was 
a 
great 
grief 
to 
me. 
This 
young 
man, 
of 
whom 
I 
spoke 
to 
you
last 
summer,<p>
is 
so 
noble-minded 
and 
full 
of 
that 
real 
youthfulness 
which
one 
seldom 
finds 
nowadays 
among 
our 
old 
men 
of 
twenty 
and, 
particularly,
he 
is 
so 
frank 
and 
has 
so 
much 
heart. 
He 
is 
so 
pure 
and 
poetic 
that
my 
relations 
with 
him, 
transient 
as 
they 
were, 
have 
been 
one 
of 
the
sweetest 
comforts 
to 
my 
poor 
heart, 
which 
has 
already 
suffered 
so 
much.
Someday 
I 
will 
tell 
you 
about 
our 
parting 
and 
all 
that 
was 
said 
then.
That 
is 
still 
too 
fresh. 
Ah, 
dear 
friend, 
you 
are 
happy 
not 
to 
know
these 
poignant 
joys 
and 
sorrows. 
You 
are 
fortunate, 
for 
the 
latter 
are
generally 
the 
stronger! 
I 
know 
very 
well 
that 
Count 
Nicholas 
is 
too
young 
ever 
to 
be 
more 
to 
me 
than 
a 
friend, 
but 
this 
sweet 
friendship,
this 
poetic 
and 
pure 
intimacy, 
were 
what 
my 
heart 
needed. 
But 
enough 
of
this! 
The 
chief 
news, 
about 
which 
all 
Moscow 
gossips, 
is 
the 
death 
of
old 
Count 
Bezukhov, 
and 
his 
inheritance. 
Fancy! 
The 
three 
princesses
have 
received 
very 
little, 
Prince 
Vasili 
nothing, 
and 
it 
is 
Monsieur
Pierre 
who 
has 
inherited 
all 
the 
property 
and 
has 
besides 
been
recognized 
as 
legitimate; 
so 
that 
he 
is 
now 
Count 
Bezukhov 
and
possessor 
of 
the 
finest 
fortune 
in 
Russia. 
It 
is 
rumored 
that 
Prince
Vasili 
played 
a 
very 
despicable 
part 
in 
this 
affair 
and 
that 
he
returned 
to 
Petersburg 
quite 
crestfallen.

I 
confess 
I 
understand 
very 
little 
about 
all 
these 
matters 
of 
wills 
and
inheritance; 
but 
I 
do 
know 
that 
since 
this 
young 
man, 
whom 
we 
all 
used
to 
know 
as 
plain 
Monsieur 
Pierre, 
has 
become 
Count 
Bezukhov 
and 
the
owner 
of 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
fortunes 
in 
Russia, 
I 
am 
much 
amused 
to
watch 
the 
change 
in 
the 
tone 
and 
manners 
of 
the 
mammas 
burdened 
by
marriageable 
daughters, 
and 
of 
the 
young 
ladies 
themselves, 
toward
him, 
though, 
between 
you 
and 
me, 
he 
always 
seemed 
to 
me 
a 
poor 
sort
of 
fellow. 
As 
for 
the 
past 
two 
years 
people 
have 
amused 
themselves
by 
finding 
husbands 
for 
me 
(most 
of<p>
whom 
I 
don't 
even 
know), 
the
matchmaking 
chronicles 
of 
Moscow 
now 
speak 
of 
me 
as 
the 
future 
Countess
Bezukhova. 
But 
you 
will 
understand 
that 
I 
have 
no 
desire 
for 
the 
post.
A 
propos 
of 
marriages: 
do 
you 
know 
that 
a 
while 
ago 
that 
universal
auntie 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
told 
me, 
under 
the 
seal 
of 
strict 
secrecy, 
of
a 
plan 
of 
marriage 
for 
you. 
It 
is 
neither 
more 
nor 
less 
than 
with 
Prince
Vasili's 
son 
Anatole, 
whom 
they 
wish 
to 
reform 
by 
marrying 
him 
to
someone 
rich 
and 
distinguee, 
and 
it 
is 
on 
you 
that 
his<p>
relations'
choice 
has 
fallen. 
I 
don't 
know 
what 
you 
will 
think 
of 
it, 
but
I 
consider 
it 
my 
duty 
to 
let 
you 
know 
of 
it. 
He 
is 
said 
to 
be<p>
very
handsome 
and 
a 
terrible
