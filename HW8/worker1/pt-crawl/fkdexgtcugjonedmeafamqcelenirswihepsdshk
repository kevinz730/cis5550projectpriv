general 
attention</h1>turned 
to 
the 
police
superintendent's 
trap 
which 
drove 
into 
the 
square 
attended 
by 
two
mounted 
dragoons.

The 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vP6Qz2iCtOt0bI.html">superintendent</a> 
of 
police, 
who 
had 
gone 
that 
morning 
by 
Count
Rostopchin's 
orders 
to 
burn 
the 
barges 
and 
had<p>
in 
connection 
with 
that
matter 
acquired<p>
a 
large 
sum 
of 
money 
which 
was 
at 
that 
moment 
in 
his
pocket, 
on 
seeing 
a 
crowd 
bearing 
down 
upon 
him 
told 
his 
coachman 
to
stop.

"What 
people 
are 
these?" 
he 
shouted 
to 
the 
men, 
who 
were 
moving 
singly
and 
timidly 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
his 
trap.

"What 
people 
are 
these?" 
he 
shouted 
again, 
receiving 
no 
answer.

"Your 
honor..." 
replied 
the 
shopman 
<a href="/cZl/xp9U8P.html">in</a> 
the 
frieze 
coat, 
"your 
honor, 
in
accord 
with 
the 
proclamation 
of 
his 
highest 
excellency 
the 
count, 
they
desire 
to 
serve, 
not 
sparing 
their 
lives, 
and 
it 
is 
not 
any 
kind 
of
riot, 
but 
as 
his 
highest 
excellence 
said..."

"The 
count 
has 
not 
left, 
he 
is 
here, 
and 
an 
order 
will 
be 
issued
concerning 
you," 
said 
the 
superintendent 
of 
police. 
"Go 
on!" 
he 
ordered
his 
coachman.

The 
crowd 
halted, 
pressing 
around 
those 
who 
had 
heard 
what 
the
superintendent 
had 
said, 
and 
looking 
at 
the 
departing 
trap.

The 
superintendent 
of 
police 
turned 
round 
at 
that 
moment 
with 
a 
scared
look, 
said 
something 
to 
his 
coachman, 
and 
his 
horses 
increased 
their
speed.

"It's 
a 
fraud, 
lads! 
Lead 
the 
way 
to 
him, 
himself!"
