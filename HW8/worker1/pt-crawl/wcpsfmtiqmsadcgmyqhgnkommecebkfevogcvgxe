prisons</h1>on
affairs 
of 
which 
she 
never 
spoke 
to 
anyone. 
On 
ordinary 
days, 
after
dressing, 
she 
received 
petitioners 
of 
various 
classes, 
of 
whom 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/zW86UTE0JEcRg.html">there
were</a> 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/SNe24ZV5oeog.html">always</a> 
some. 
Then 
she 
had 
dinner, 
a 
substantial 
and 
appetizing 
meal
at 
which 
there 
were 
always 
three 
or 
four 
guests; 
after 
dinner 
she 
played
a 
game 
of 
boston, 
and<p>
at 
night 
she 
had 
the 
newspapers 
or 
a 
new 
book 
read
to 
her 
while 
she 
knitted. 
She 
rarely 
made 
an 
exception 
and 
went 
out 
to
pay 
visits, 
and 
then 
only 
to 
the 
most 
important 
persons 
in 
the 
town.

She 
had 
not 
yet 
gone 
to 
bed 
when 
the 
Rostovs 
arrived 
and 
the 
pulley 
of
the 
hall 
door 
squeaked 
from 
the 
cold 
as 
it 
let 
in 
the 
Rostovs 
and 
their
servants. 
Marya 
Dmitrievna, 
with 
her 
spectacles 
hanging 
down 
on 
her
nose 
and 
her 
head 
flung 
back, 
stood 
in 
the 
hall 
doorway 
looking 
with
a 
stern, 
grim 
face 
at 
the 
new 
arrivals. 
One 
might 
have 
thought 
she 
was
angry 
with 
the 
travelers 
and 
would 
immediately 
turn 
them 
out, 
had 
she
not 
at 
the 
same 
time 
been 
giving 
careful<p>
instructions 
to 
the 
servants
for 
the 
accommodation 
of 
<a href="/aVzUge/sk4tvrb5gcnoA5fPTu.html">the</a> 
visitors 
and 
their 
belongings.

"The 
count's 
things? 
Bring 
them 
here," 
she 
said, 
pointing 
to 
the
portmanteaus 
and 
not 
greeting 
anyone. 
"The 
young 
ladies'? 
There
to 
the 
left. 
Now 
what 
are 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ztf9sVDPn6nrOP4YWUw.html">you</a> 
dawdling 
for?" 
she 
cried 
to 
the 
maids.
"Get 
the 
samovar 
ready!... 
You've 
grown 
plumper 
and 
prettier," 
she
remarked, 
drawing 
Natasha 
(whose 
cheeks 
were 
glowing 
from 
the 
cold)
to 
her 
by 
the 
hood. 
"Foo! 
You 
are 
cold! 
Now 
take 
off 
your 
things,
quick!" 
she 
shouted 
to 
the 
count 
who 
was 
going 
to 
kiss 
her 
hand.
"You're 
half 
frozen, 
I'm 
sure! 
Bring 
some 
rum 
for 
tea!... 
Bonjour,
Sonya 
dear!" 
she 
added, 
turning<p>
to 
Sonya
