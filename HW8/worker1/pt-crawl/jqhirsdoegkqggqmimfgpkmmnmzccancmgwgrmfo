just</h1>to 
punish 
him-Rostov. 
Then 
he 
imagined 
how,
after 
the 
attack, 
Bogdanich 
would 
come 
up 
to 
him 
as 
he 
lay 
wounded 
and
would 
magnanimously 
extend 
the 
hand 
of 
reconciliation.

The 
high-shouldered 
figure 
of 
Zherkov, 
familiar 
to 
the 
Pavlograds 
as
he 
had 
but 
recently 
left 
their 
regiment, 
rode 
up 
to 
the 
colonel.
After 
his 
dismissal 
from 
headquarters 
Zherkov 
had 
not 
remained 
in 
the
regiment, 
saying 
he 
was 
not 
such 
a 
fool 
as 
to 
slave 
at 
the 
front 
when 
he
could 
get 
more 
rewards 
by 
doing 
nothing 
on 
the 
staff, 
and 
had 
succeeded
in 
attaching 
himself 
as 
an 
orderly 
officer 
to 
Prince 
Bagration. 
He 
now
came 
to 
his 
former 
chief 
with 
an 
order 
from 
the 
commander 
of 
the 
rear
guard.

"Colonel," 
he 
said, 
addressing 
Rostov's 
enemy 
with 
an 
air 
of
gloomy 
gravity 
and 
glancing 
round 
at 
his 
comrades, 
"there 
is 
an 
order
to 
stop 
and 
fire 
the 
bridge."

"An 
order 
to 
who?" 
asked 
the 
colonel 
morosely.

"I 
don't 
myself 
know 
'to 
who,'" 
replied 
the 
cornet<p>
in 
a
serious 
tone, 
"but 
the 
prince 
told 
me 
to 
'go 
and 
tell 
the 
colonel
that 
the 
hussars 
must 
return 
quickly 
and 
fire 
the 
bridge.'"

Zherkov 
was 
followed 
by 
an 
officer 
of 
the 
suite 
who 
rode 
up 
to 
the
colonel 
of 
hussars 
with 
the 
same 
order. 
After 
him 
the 
stout 
Nesvitski
came 
galloping 
up 
on 
a 
Cossack 
horse 
that 
could 
scarcely 
carry 
his
weight.

"How's 
this, 
Colonel?" 
he 
shouted 
as 
he 
approached. 
"I 
told 
you
to 
fire 
the 
bridge, 
and 
now 
someone 
has 
gone 
and 
blundered; 
they 
are 
all
beside 
themselves 
over 
there 
and 
one 
can't 
make 
anything 
out."

The 
colonel 
deliberately 
stopped 
the 
regiment 
and 
turned 
to 
Nesvitski.

"You 
spoke 
to 
me 
of 
inflammable 
material," 
said 
he, 
"but 
you 
said
nothing 
about 
firing 
it."

"But, 
my 
dear 
sir," 
said 
Nesvitski 
as 
he 
drew 
up, 
taking 
off 
his
cap 
and 
smoothing 
his 
hair 
wet 
with 
perspiration 
with 
his 
plump 
hand,
"wasn't 
I 
telling 
you 
to 
fire 
the 
bridge, 
when 
inflammable 
material
had 
been 
put 
in 
position?"

"I 
am 
not 
your 
'dear 
sir,' 
Mr. 
Staff 
Officer, 
and 
you 
did 
not 
tell
me 
to 
burn 
the 
bridge! 
I 
know 
the 
service, 
and 
it 
is 
my 
habit 
orders
strictly 
to 
obey. 
You 
said 
the 
bridge 
would 
be 
burned, 
but 
who 
would
burn 
it, 
I 
could 
not 
know 
by 
the 
holy 
spirit!"

"Ah, 
that's 
always 
the 
way!" 
said 
Nesvitski 
with 
a 
wave 
of 
the
hand. 
"How 
did 
you 
get 
here?" 
said 
he, 
turning 
to 
Zherkov.

"On 
the 
same 
business. 
But 
you 
are 
damp! 
Let 
me 
wring 
you 
out!"

"You 
were 
saying, 
Mr. 
Staff 
Officer..." 
continued 
the 
colonel 
in 
an
offended 
tone.

"Colonel," 
interrupted 
the 
officer 
of 
the 
suite, 
"You 
must 
be
quick 
or 
the 
enemy 
will 
bring 
up 
his 
guns 
to 
use 
grapeshot."

The 
colonel 
looked 
silently 
at 
the 
officer 
of 
the 
suite, 
at 
the 
stout
staff 
officer, 
and 
at 
Zherkov, 
and 
he 
frowned.

"I 
will 
the 
bridge 
fire," 
he 
said 
in 
a 
solemn 
tone 
as 
if 
to<p>
announce
that 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
the 
unpleasantness 
he 
had 
to 
endure 
he 
would 
still
do 
the 
right 
thing.

Striking 
his 
horse 
with 
his 
long 
muscular 
legs 
as 
if 
it 
were 
to 
blame
for 
everything, 
the 
colonel 
moved 
forward 
and 
ordered 
the 
second
squadron, 
that 
in 
which 
Rostov 
was 
serving 
under 
Denisov, 
to 
return 
to
the 
bridge.

"There, 
it's 
just 
as 
I 
thought," 
said 
Rostov 
to 
himself. 
"He
wishes 
to 
test 
me!" 
His 
heart 
contracted 
and 
the 
blood 
rushed 
to 
his
face. 
"Let 
him 
see 
whether 
I 
am 
a 
coward!" 
he 
thought.

Again 
on 
all 
the 
bright 
faces 
of 
the 
squadron 
the 
serious 
expression
appeared 
that 
they 
had 
worn 
when 
under 
fire. 
Rostov 
watched 
his 
enemy,
the 
colonel, 
closely-to 
find 
in 
his 
face 
confirmation 
of 
his 
own
conjecture, 
but 
the 
colonel 
did 
not 
once 
glance 
at 
Rostov, 
and 
looked
as 
he 
always 
did 
when
