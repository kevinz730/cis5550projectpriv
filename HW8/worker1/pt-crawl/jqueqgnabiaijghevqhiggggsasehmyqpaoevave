foul 
streets,
tattered 
inhabitants,</h1>and 
the 
sick 
and 
drunken 
soldiers 
wandering 
about.

The 
hospital 
was 
in 
a 
brick 
building 
with 
some 
of 
the 
window 
frames 
and
panes 
broken 
and 
a 
courtyard 
surrounded 
by 
the 
remains 
of 
a 
wooden 
fence
that 
had 
been 
pulled 
to 
pieces. 
Several 
bandaged 
soldiers, 
with 
pale
swollen 
faces, 
were 
sitting 
or 
walking 
about 
in 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/GF1Scb11n.html">sunshine</a> 
in 
the
yard.

Directly 
Rostov 
entered 
the 
door 
he 
was 
enveloped 
by 
a 
smell 
of
putrefaction 
and 
hospital 
air. 
On 
the 
stairs 
he 
met 
a 
Russian 
army
doctor 
smoking 
a 
cigar. 
The 
doctor 
was 
followed 
by 
a 
Russian 
assistant.

"I 
can't 
tear 
myself 
to 
pieces," 
the 
doctor 
was 
saying. 
"Come 
to
Makar 
Alexeevich 
in 
the 
evening. 
I 
shall 
be 
there."

The 
assistant 
asked 
some 
further 
questions.

"Oh, 
do 
the 
best 
you 
can! 
Isn't<p>
it 
all 
the 
same?" 
The 
doctor
noticed 
Rostov 
coming 
upstairs.

"What 
do 
you 
want, 
sir?" 
said 
the 
doctor. 
"What 
do 
you 
want?
The 
bullets 
having 
spared 
you, 
do 
you 
want 
to 
try 
typhus? 
This 
is 
a
pesthouse, 
sir."

"How 
so?" 
asked 
Rostov.

"Typhus, 
sir. 
It's 
death 
to 
go 
in. 
Only 
we 
two, 
Makeev 
and 
I" 
(he
pointed 
to 
the 
assistant), 
"keep 
on 
here. 
Some 
five 
of 
us 
doctors 
have
died 
in 
this 
place.... 
When 
a 
new 
one 
comes 
he 
is 
done 
for 
in 
a 
week,"
said 
the 
doctor 
with 
evident 
satisfaction. 
"Prussian 
doctors 
have 
been
invited 
here, 
but 
our 
allies 
don't 
like 
it 
at 
all."

Rostov 
explained 
that 
he 
wanted 
to 
see 
Major 
Denisov 
of 
the 
hussars,
who 
was 
wounded.

"I 
don't 
know. 
I 
can't 
tell 
you, 
sir. 
Only 
think! 
I 
am 
alone 
in
charge 
of 
three 
hospitals 
with 
more 
than 
four 
hundred 
patients! 
It's
well 
that 
the 
charitable 
Prussian 
ladies 
send 
us 
two 
pounds 
of 
coffee
and 
some 
lint 
each 
month 
or 
we 
should 
be 
lost!" 
he 
laughed. 
"Four
hundred, 
sir, 
and 
they're 
always 
sending 
me 
fresh 
ones. 
There 
are 
four
hundred? 
Eh?" 
he 
asked, 
turning 
to 
the 
assistant.

The 
assistant 
looked 
fagged 
out. 
He 
was 
evidently 
vexed 
and 
impatient
for 
the 
talkative 
doctor 
to 
go.

"Major 
Denisov," 
Rostov 
said 
again. 
"He 
was 
wounded 
at
Molliten."

"Dead, 
I 
fancy. 
Eh, 
Makeev?" 
queried 
the 
doctor, 
in 
a 
tone 
of
indifference.

The 
assistant, 
however, 
did 
not 
confirm 
the 
doctor's 
words.

"Is 
he 
tall 
and 
with 
reddish 
hair?" 
asked 
the 
doctor.

Rostov 
described 
Denisov's 
appearance.

"There 
was 
one 
like 
that," 
said 
the 
doctor, 
as 
if 
pleased. 
"That
one 
is 
dead, 
I 
fancy. 
However, 
I'll 
look 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hI3tc2BnCGW3iLv.html">up</a> 
our 
list. 
We 
had 
a 
list.
Have 
you 
got 
it, 
Makeev?"

"Makar 
Alexeevich 
has<p>
the 
list," 
answered 
the 
assistant. 
"But 
if
you'll 
step 
into 
the 
officers' 
wards 
you'll 
see 
for 
yourself,"
he 
added, 
turning 
to 
Rostov.

"Ah, 
you'd 
better 
not 
go, 
sir," 
said 
the 
doctor, 
"or 
you 
may
have 
to 
stay 
here 
yourself."

But 
Rostov 
bowed 
himself 
away 
from 
the 
doctor 
and 
asked 
the 
assistant
to 
show 
him 
the 
way.

"Only 
don't 
blame 
me!" 
the 
doctor 
shouted 
up 
after 
him.

Rostov 
and 
the 
assistant 
went 
into 
the 
dark 
corridor. 
The 
smell 
was 
so
strong 
there 
that 
Rostov 
held 
his 
nose 
and 
had 
to 
pause 
and 
collect
his 
strength 
before 
he 
could 
go 
on. 
A 
door 
opened 
to 
the 
right, 
and 
an
emaciated 
sallow 
man 
on 
crutches, 
barefoot 
and 
in 
underclothing, 
limped
out 
and, 
leaning 
against 
the 
doorpost, 
looked 
with 
glittering 
envious
eyes 
at<p>
those 
who 
were 
passing. 
Glancing 
in 
at 
the 
door, 
Rostov
saw 
that 
the 
sick 
and 
wounded 
were 
lying 
on 
the 
floor 
on 
straw 
and
overcoats.

"May 
I 
go 
in 
and 
look?"

"What 
is 
there 
to 
see?" 
said 
the 
assistant.

But, 
just 
because
