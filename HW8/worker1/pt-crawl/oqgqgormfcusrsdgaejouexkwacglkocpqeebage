squatting</h1>on 
his 
heels 
in 
front 
of 
a 
clerk. 
The 
clerk, 
with 
cuffs 
turned
up, 
was 
<a href="/cZl/UJ9Nec8sCi3cYy.html">hastily</a> 
writing 
at 
a 
tub 
turned 
bottom 
upwards. 
Kozlovski's
face 
looked 
worn-he 
too 
had 
evidently 
not 
slept 
all 
night. 
He 
glanced
at 
Prince 
Andrew 
and 
did 
not 
even 
nod 
to 
him.

"Second 
line... 
have 
you 
written 
it?" 
he 
continued 
dictating 
to 
the
clerk. 
"The 
Kiev 
Grenadiers, 
Podolian..."

"One<p>
can't 
write 
so 
fast, 
<a href="/cZl/rR4N5kNHe.html">your</a> 
honor," 
said 
the 
clerk, 
glancing
angrily 
and 
disrespectfully 
at 
Kozlovski.

Through 
the 
door 
came 
the 
sounds 
of 
Kutuzov's 
voice, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bS3VwPy09.html">excited</a> 
and
dissatisfied, 
interrupted 
by 
another, 
an 
unfamiliar 
voice. 
From 
the
sound 
of 
these 
voices, 
the 
inattentive 
way 
Kozlovski 
looked 
at 
him, 
the
disrespectful 
manner 
of 
the 
exhausted 
clerk, 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
clerk 
and
Kozlovski 
were 
squatting 
on 
the 
floor 
by 
a 
tub 
so 
near 
to 
the 
commander
in 
chief, 
and 
from 
the 
noisy 
laughter 
of 
the 
Cossacks 
holding 
the
horses 
near 
the 
window, 
Prince 
Andrew 
felt 
that 
something 
important 
and
disastrous 
was 
about 
to 
happen.

He 
turned 
to 
Kozlovski 
with 
urgent 
questions.

"Immediately, 
Prince," 
said 
Kozlovski. 
"Dispositions 
for
Bagration."

"What 
about 
capitulation?"

"Nothing 
of 
the 
sort. 
Orders 
are 
issued 
for 
a 
battle."

Prince 
Andrew 
moved 
toward 
the 
door 
from 
whence 
voices 
were 
heard.
Just 
as 
he 
was 
going 
to 
open 
it 
the 
sounds 
ceased, 
the 
door 
opened, 
and
Kutuzov 
with 
his 
eagle 
nose 
and 
puffy 
face 
appeared 
in 
the 
doorway.
Prince 
Andrew 
stood 
right 
in 
front 
of<p>
Kutuzov 
but 
the 
expression 
of
the 
commander 
in 
chief's 
one 
sound 
eye 
showed 
him 
to 
be 
so 
preoccupied
with 
thoughts 
and 
anxieties 
as 
to 
be 
oblivious 
of 
his 
presence. 
He
looked 
straight 
at 
his 
adjutant's 
face 
without 
recognizing 
him.

"Well, 
have 
you 
finished?" 
said 
he 
to 
Kozlovski.

"One 
moment, 
your 
excellency."

Bagration, 
a 
gaunt 
middle-aged 
man 
of 
medium 
height 
with 
a 
firm,
impassive 
face 
of 
Oriental 
type, 
came 
out 
after 
the 
commander 
in 
chief.

"I 
have 
the 
honor 
to 
present 
myself," 
repeated 
Prince 
Andrew 
rather
loudly, 
handing 
Kutuzov 
an 
envelope.

"Ah, 
from 
Vienna? 
Very 
good. 
Later, 
later!"

Kutuzov 
went 
out 
into 
the 
porch 
with 
Bagration.

"Well, 
good-by, 
Prince," 
said 
he 
to 
Bagration. 
"My 
blessing, 
and
may<p>
Christ 
be 
with 
you 
in 
your 
great 
endeavor!"

His 
face 
suddenly 
softened 
and 
tears 
came 
into 
his 
eyes. 
With 
his 
left
hand 
he 
drew 
Bagration 
toward 
him, 
and 
with 
his 
right, 
on 
which 
he 
wore
a 
ring, 
he 
made 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
cross 
over 
him 
with 
a 
gesture 
evidently
habitual, 
offering 
his 
puffy 
cheek, 
but 
Bagration 
kissed 
him 
on 
the
neck 
instead.

"Christ 
be 
with 
you!" 
Kutuzov 
repeated 
and 
went 
toward 
his
carriage. 
"Get 
in 
with 
me," 
said 
he 
to 
Bolkonski.

"Your 
excellency, 
I 
should 
like 
to 
be 
of 
use 
here. 
Allow 
me 
to 
remain
with 
Prince 
Bagration's 
detachment."

"Get 
in," 
said 
Kutuzov, 
and 
noticing 
that 
Bolkonski 
still 
delayed,
he 
added:
