colonel 
in 
an
offended</h1>tone.

"Colonel," 
interrupted 
the<p>
officer 
of 
the 
suite, 
"You 
must 
be
quick 
or 
the 
enemy 
will 
bring 
up 
his 
guns 
to 
use 
grapeshot."

The 
colonel 
looked 
silently 
at 
the 
officer 
of 
the 
suite, 
at 
the 
stout
staff 
officer, 
and 
at 
Zherkov, 
and 
he 
frowned.

"I 
will 
the 
bridge 
fire," 
he 
said 
in 
a 
solemn 
tone 
as 
if 
to 
announce
that 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
the 
unpleasantness 
he 
had 
to 
endure 
he 
would 
still
do 
the 
right 
thing.

Striking 
his 
horse 
with 
his 
long 
muscular 
legs 
as 
if 
it 
were 
to 
blame
for 
everything, 
the 
colonel 
moved 
forward 
and 
ordered 
the 
second
squadron, 
that 
in 
which 
Rostov 
was 
serving 
under 
Denisov, 
to 
return 
to
the 
bridge.

"There, 
it's 
just 
as 
I 
thought," 
said 
Rostov 
to 
himself. 
"He
wishes 
to 
test 
me!" 
His 
heart 
contracted 
and 
the 
blood 
rushed 
to 
his
face. 
"Let 
him 
see 
whether 
I 
am 
a 
coward!" 
he 
thought.

Again 
on 
all 
the 
bright 
faces 
of 
the 
squadron 
the 
serious 
expression
appeared 
that 
they 
had 
worn 
when 
under 
fire. 
Rostov 
watched 
his 
enemy,
the 
colonel, 
closely-to 
find 
in 
his 
face 
confirmation 
of 
his 
own
conjecture, 
but 
the 
colonel 
did 
not 
once 
glance 
at 
Rostov, 
and 
looked
as 
he 
always 
did 
when 
at 
the 
front, 
solemn 
and 
stern. 
Then 
came 
the 
word
of 
command.

"Look 
sharp! 
Look 
sharp!" 
several 
voices 
repeated 
around 
him.

Their 
sabers 
catching 
in 
the 
bridles 
and 
their 
spurs 
jingling, 
the
hussars 
hastily 
dismounted, 
not 
knowing 
what 
they 
were 
to 
do. 
The 
men
were 
crossing 
themselves. 
Rostov 
no 
longer 
looked 
at 
the 
colonel, 
he
had 
no 
time. 
He 
was 
afraid 
of 
falling 
behind 
the 
hussars, 
so 
much 
afraid
that 
his 
heart 
stood 
still. 
His 
hand 
trembled 
as 
he 
gave 
his 
horse 
into
an 
orderly's 
charge, 
and 
he 
felt 
the 
blood 
rush 
to 
his 
heart 
with
a 
thud. 
Denisov 
rode 
past 
him, 
leaning 
back 
and 
shouting 
something.
Rostov 
saw 
nothing 
but 
the 
hussars 
running 
all 
around 
him, 
their 
spurs
catching 
and 
their 
sabers 
clattering.

"Stretchers!" 
shouted 
someone 
behind 
him.

Rostov 
did 
not 
think 
what 
this 
call 
for 
stretchers 
meant; 
he 
ran 
on,
trying 
only 
to 
be 
ahead 
of 
the 
others; 
but 
just 
at 
the 
bridge, 
not
looking 
at 
the 
ground, 
he 
came 
on 
some 
sticky, 
trodden 
mud, 
stumbled,
and 
fell 
on 
his 
hands. 
The 
others 
outstripped 
him.

"At 
boss 
zides, 
Captain," 
he 
heard 
the 
voice 
of 
the 
colonel,<p>
who,
having 
ridden 
ahead, 
had 
pulled 
up 
his 
horse 
near 
the 
bridge, 
with 
a
triumphant, 
cheerful 
face.

Rostov 
wiping 
his 
muddy 
hands 
on 
his 
breeches 
looked 
at 
his 
enemy 
and
was 
about 
to 
run 
on, 
thinking 
that 
the 
farther 
he 
went 
to 
the 
front
the 
better. 
But 
Bogdanich, 
<a href="/cZl/vf3gJL1H5UTE.html">without</a> 
looking 
at 
or 
recognizing 
Rostov,
shouted 
to 
him:

"Who's 
that 
running 
on<p>
the 
middle 
of 
the 
bridge? 
To 
the 
right! 
Come
back, 
Cadet!" 
he 
cried 
angrily; 
and 
turning 
to 
<a href="/cZl/qZ41SUlC6ZNkA.html">Denisov,</a> 
who, 
showing
off 
his 
courage, 
had 
ridden 
on 
to 
the 
planks 
of 
the 
bridge:

"Why 
run 
risks, 
Captain? 
You 
should 
dismount," 
he 
said.

"Oh, 
every 
bullet 
has 
its 
<a href="/cZl/QJ8oqw2H6T.html">billet,"</a> 
answered<p>
Vaska 
Denisov, 
turning
in 
his 
saddle.


Meanwhile 
Nesvitski, 
Zherkov, 
and 
the 
officer 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/kU2vxtj0vGX5ny.html">of</a> 
the 
suite 
were
standing 
together 
out 
of 
range 
of 
the 
shots, 
watching, 
now 
the 
small
group 
of 
men 
with 
yellow 
shakos, 
dark-green 
jackets 
braided 
with 
cord,
and 
blue 
riding 
breeches, 
who 
were 
swarming
