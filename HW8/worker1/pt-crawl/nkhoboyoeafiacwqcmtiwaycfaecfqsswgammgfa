CHAPTER 
IX

The 
Fifth 
company 
was 
bivouacking 
at 
the 
very 
edge 
of 
the 
forest. 
A 
huge
campfire 
was 
blazing 
brightly 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
snow, 
lighting 
up 
the
branches 
of 
trees 
heavy 
with 
hoarfrost.

About 
midnight 
they 
heard 
the 
sound 
of 
steps 
in 
the 
snow 
of 
the 
forest,
and 
the 
crackling 
of 
dry 
branches.

"A 
bear, 
lads," 
said 
one 
of 
the 
men.

They 
all 
raised 
their 
heads 
to 
listen, 
and<p>
out 
of 
the 
forest 
into 
the
bright 
firelight 
stepped 
two 
strangely 
clad 
human 
figures 
clinging 
to
one 
another.

These 
were 
<a href="/aVzUge/Hqk4G5DduKC9ven.html">two</a> 
Frenchmen 
who 
<a href="/aVzUge/hfW2t0f7UKBi.html">had</a> 
been 
hiding 
in 
the 
forest. 
They 
came 
up
to 
the 
fire, 
hoarsely 
uttering 
something 
in 
a 
language 
our 
soldiers 
did
not 
understand. 
One 
was 
taller 
than 
the 
other; 
he 
wore 
an 
officer's 
hat
and 
seemed<p>
quite 
exhausted. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/dK2oGGl5ODiFp7xt.html">On</a> 
approaching 
the 
fire 
he 
had 
been 
going 
to
sit 
down, 
but 
fell. 
The 
other, 
a 
short 
sturdy 
soldier 
with 
a 
shawl
tied 
round 
his 
head, 
was 
stronger. 
He 
raised 
his 
companion 
and 
said
something, 
pointing 
to 
his 
mouth. 
The 
soldiers 
surrounded 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/itU3CBzhL3E1EMvs.html">the</a> 
Frenchmen,
spread 
a 
greatcoat 
on 
the 
ground 
for 
the 
sick 
man, 
and 
brought 
some
buckwheat 
porridge 
and 
vodka 
for 
both 
of 
them.
