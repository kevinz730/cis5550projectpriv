only 
the 
ecossaise, 
the 
anglaise, 
and
the 
mazurka, 
which 
was 
just 
coming 
into 
fashion, 
were 
danced. 
Iogel 
had
taken 
a<p>
ballroom 
in 
Bezukhov's 
house, 
and 
the 
ball, 
as 
everyone 
said,
was 
a 
great 
success. 
There 
were 
many 
pretty 
girls 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/vbc998KpkPN.html">the</a> 
Rostov 
girls
were 
among 
the 
prettiest. 
They 
were 
both 
particularly 
happy 
and 
gay.
That 
evening, 
proud 
of 
Dolokhov's 
proposal, 
her 
refusal, 
and 
her
explanation 
with 
Nicholas, 
Sonya 
twirled 
about 
before 
she 
left 
home
so 
that 
the 
maid 
could 
hardly 
get 
her 
hair 
plaited, 
and 
she 
was
transparently 
radiant 
with 
<a href="/cZl/rR4N5kNHe.html">impulsive</a> 
joy.

Natasha 
no 
less 
proud 
of 
her 
first 
long 
dress 
and 
of 
being 
at 
a 
real
ball 
was 
even 
happier. 
They 
were 
both 
dressed 
in 
white 
muslin 
with 
pink
ribbons.

Natasha 
fell 
in 
love 
the 
very 
moment 
she 
entered 
the 
ballroom. 
She
was 
not 
in 
love 
with 
anyone 
in 
particular, 
but 
with 
everyone. 
Whatever
person 
she 
happened 
to 
look 
at 
she 
was 
in 
love 
with 
for 
that 
moment.

"Oh, 
how 
delightful 
it 
is!" 
she 
kept 
saying, 
running 
up 
to 
Sonya.

Nicholas 
and 
Denisov 
were 
walking 
up 
and 
down, 
looking 
with 
kindly
patronage 
<a href="/cZl/uI3zT3Dj7dS.html">at</a> 
the 
dancers.

"How 
sweet 
she 
is-she 
will 
be 
a 
weal 
beauty!" 
said 
Denisov.

"Who?"

"Countess 
Natasha," 
answered 
Denisov.

"And 
how 
she 
dances! 
What 
gwace!" 
he 
said 
again 
after 
a 
pause.

"Who 
are 
you 
talking 
about?"

"About 
your 
sister," 
ejaculated 
Denisov 
testily.

Rostov 
smiled.

"My 
dear 
count, 
you 
were 
one 
of 
my 
best 
pupils-you 
must 
dance,"
said 
little 
Iogel 
coming 
up 
to 
Nicholas. 
"Look 
how 
many 
charming 
young
ladies-" 
He 
turned 
with 
the 
same 
request 
to 
Denisov 
who 
was 
also 
a
former 
pupil 
of 
<a href="/cZl/JE1KDz1HI.html">his.

"No,</a> 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
I'll 
be 
a 
wallflower," 
said 
Denisov.
"Don't 
you 
wecollect 
what 
bad 
use 
I<p>
made 
of 
your 
lessons?"

"Oh 
no!" 
said 
Iogel, 
hastening 
to 
reassure 
him. 
"You 
were 
only
inattentive, 
but 
you 
had 
talent-oh 
yes, 
you 
had 
talent!"

The 
band 
struck 
up 
the 
newly 
introduced 
mazurka. 
Nicholas 
could 
not
refuse 
Iogel 
and 
asked 
Sonya 
to 
dance. 
Denisov 
sat 
down 
by 
the 
old
ladies 
and, 
leaning 
on 
his 
saber 
and 
beating<p>
time 
with 
his 
foot, 
told
them 
something 
funny 
and 
kept 
them 
amused,
