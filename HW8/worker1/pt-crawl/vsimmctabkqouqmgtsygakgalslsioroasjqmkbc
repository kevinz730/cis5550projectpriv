and 
seizing 
the 
marble 
top 
of 
a 
table
with 
a 
strength 
he

terrible,

His

CHAPTER 
VII

Two 
months 
had 
elapsed 
since 
the 
news 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Austerlitz 
and
the 
loss 
of 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
reached 
Bald 
Hills, 
and 
in 
spite 
of 
the
letters 
sent 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/nB9UJpiB5Wtf8tc.html">through</a> 
the 
embassy 
and 
all 
the 
searches 
made, 
his 
body 
had
not 
<a href="/cZl/jf4H02Npkec.html">been</a> 
found 
nor 
was 
he 
on 
the 
list 
of 
prisoners. 
What 
was 
worst 
of
all 
for 
his 
relations 
was 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
was 
still 
a 
possibility 
of
his 
having 
been 
picked 
up 
on 
the 
battlefield 
by 
the 
people 
of 
the
place 
and 
that 
he 
might 
now 
be 
lying, 
recovering 
or 
dying, 
alone 
among
strangers 
and 
unable 
to 
send 
news 
of 
himself. 
The 
gazettes 
from 
which
the 
old 
prince<p>
first 
heard 
of 
the 
defeat 
at 
Austerlitz 
stated, 
as 
usual
very 
briefly 
and 
vaguely, 
that 
after 
brilliant 
engagements 
the 
Russians
had 
had 
to 
retreat 
and 
had 
made 
their 
withdrawal 
in 
perfect 
order. 
The
old 
prince 
understood 
from 
this 
official 
report 
that 
our 
army 
had 
been
defeated. 
A 
week 
after 
the 
gazette 
report 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Austerlitz
came 
a 
letter 
from 
Kutuzov 
informing 
the 
prince 
of 
the 
fate 
that 
had
befallen 
his 
son.

"Your 
son,"<p>
wrote 
Kutuzov, 
"fell 
before 
my 
eyes, 
a 
standard 
in
his 
hand 
and 
at 
the 
head 
of 
a 
regiment-he 
fell 
as 
a 
hero, 
worthy 
of
his 
father 
and 
his 
fatherland. 
To 
the 
great 
regret 
of 
myself 
and 
of 
the
whole 
army 
it 
is 
<a href="/aVzUge/WU9KXJ0ACoNJ.html">still</a> 
uncertain 
whether 
he 
is 
alive 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ct7o64GFXfk.html">or</a> 
not. 
I 
comfort
myself 
and 
you 
with 
the 
hope 
that 
your 
son 
is 
alive, 
for 
otherwise
he 
would 
have 
been 
mentioned 
among 
the 
officers 
found 
on 
the 
field 
of
battle, 
a 
list 
of 
whom 
has 
been 
sent 
me 
under 
flag 
of 
truce."

After 
receiving 
this 
news 
late 
in 
the 
evening, 
when 
he 
was 
alone 
in 
his
study,
