to 
happen, 
as 
there</h1>is 
between 
those 
who 
declared 
that 
the
earth 
was 
stationary 
and 
that 
the 
planets 
moved 
round 
it 
and 
those 
who
admitted 
that 
they 
did 
not 
know 
what 
upheld 
the 
earth, 
but 
knew 
there
were 
laws 
directing 
its 
movement 
and 
that 
of 
the 
other 
planets. 
There
is, 
and 
can 
be, 
no 
cause 
of 
an 
historical 
event 
except 
the 
one 
cause 
of
all 
causes. 
But 
there 
are 
laws 
directing 
events, 
and 
some 
of 
these 
laws
are 
known 
to 
us 
while 
we 
are 
conscious 
of 
others 
we 
cannot 
comprehend.
The 
discovery 
of 
these 
laws 
is 
only 
possible 
when 
we 
have 
quite
abandoned 
the 
attempt 
to 
find 
the 
cause 
in 
the 
will 
of 
some 
one 
man,
just 
as 
the 
discovery 
of 
the 
laws 
of 
the 
motion 
of 
the 
planets 
was
possible 
only 
when 
men 
abandoned 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
fixity 
of 
the
earth.

The 
historians 
consider 
that, 
next 
to 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino 
and 
the
occupation 
of 
Moscow 
by 
the 
enemy 
and 
its 
destruction 
by 
fire, 
the 
most
important 
episode 
of 
the 
war 
<a href="/cZl/aYs3Uo1yeL4.html">of</a> 
1812 
was 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
Russian
army 
from 
the 
Ryazana 
to 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
and 
to 
the 
Tarutino 
camp-the
so-called 
flank 
march 
across 
the 
Krasnaya 
Pakhra 
River. 
<a href="/cZl/UxO6pSZHI5cLYU2qjYtS.html">They</a> 
ascribe 
the
glory 
of 
that 
achievement 
of 
genius 
to 
different 
men 
and 
dispute 
as 
to
whom 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NIL9Xs90xR.html">honor</a> 
is 
due. 
Even 
foreign 
historians, 
including 
the 
French,
acknowledge 
the 
genius 
of 
the 
Russian 
commanders 
when 
they 
speak 
of
that 
flank 
march. 
But 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
understand 
why 
military 
writers,
and 
following 
them 
others, 
consider 
this 
flank 
march 
to 
be 
the 
profound
conception 
of 
some 
one 
man 
who 
saved 
Russia 
and 
destroyed 
Napoleon. 
In
the 
first 
place 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
understand 
where 
the 
profundity 
and 
genius
of 
this 
movement 
lay, 
for 
not 
much 
mental 
effort 
was 
needed 
to 
see 
that
the 
best 
position 
for 
an 
army 
when 
it 
is 
not 
being 
attacked 
is 
where
there 
are 
most 
provisions; 
and 
even 
a 
dull 
boy 
of 
thirteen 
could 
have
guessed 
that 
the 
best 
position 
for 
an 
army 
after 
its 
retreat 
from 
Moscow
in 
1812 
was 
on 
the 
Kaluga 
road. 
So 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
understand 
by
what 
reasoning 
the 
historians 
reach 
the 
conclusion 
that 
this 
maneuver
was 
a 
profound 
one. 
And 
it 
is 
even 
more 
difficult 
to 
understand 
just 
why
they 
think 
that 
this 
maneuver 
was 
calculated 
to 
save 
Russia 
and 
destroy
the 
French; 
for 
this 
flank 
march, 
had 
it 
been 
preceded, 
accompanied,
or 
followed 
by 
other
