course, 
that 
His 
Imperial</h1>Highness
rode 
with 
our 
regiment 
all 
the 
time, 
so 
that 
we 
had 
every 
comfort 
and
every 
advantage. 
What 
receptions 
we 
had 
<a href="/aVzUge/bh1zNkID7Gmw.html">in</a> 
Poland! 
What 
dinners 
and
balls! 
I 
can't 
tell 
you. 
And 
the 
Tsarevich 
was 
very 
gracious 
to 
all
our 
officers."

And 
the 
two 
friends 
told 
each 
other 
of 
their 
doings, 
the 
one 
of 
his
hussar 
revels 
and 
life 
in 
the 
fighting 
line, 
the 
other 
of 
the 
pleasures
and 
advantages 
of 
service 
under 
members 
of 
the 
Imperial 
family.

"Oh, 
you 
Guards!" 
said 
Rostov. 
"I 
say, 
send 
for 
some 
wine."

Boris 
made 
a 
grimace.

"If 
you 
really 
want 
it," 
said 
he.

He 
went 
to 
his 
bed, 
drew 
a 
purse 
from 
under 
the 
clean 
pillow, 
and 
sent
for 
wine.

"Yes, 
and 
I 
have 
<a href="/cZl/ej3KSVyY1dBoY3vtfU.html">some</a> 
money 
and 
a 
letter 
to 
<a href="/cZl/iF1Xiis9P8C.html">give</a> 
you," 
he 
added.

Rostov 
took 
the 
letter 
and, 
throwing 
the 
money 
<a href="/aVzUge/yY2oP8cV4S.html">on</a> 
the 
sofa, 
put 
both
arms 
on 
the 
table 
and 
began 
to 
read. 
After 
reading 
a 
few<p>
lines, 
he
glanced 
angrily 
at 
Berg, 
then, 
meeting 
his 
eyes, 
hid 
his 
face 
behind 
the
letter.

"Well, 
they've 
sent 
you 
a 
tidy 
sum," 
said 
Berg, 
eying 
the 
heavy
purse 
that 
sank 
into 
the 
sofa. 
"As 
for 
us, 
Count, 
we 
get 
along 
on 
our
pay. 
I 
can 
tell 
you 
for 
myself..."

"I 
say, 
Berg, 
my 
dear 
fellow," 
said 
Rostov, 
"when 
you 
get 
a
letter 
from 
home 
and 
meet 
one 
of 
your 
own 
people 
whom 
you 
want 
to 
talk
everything 
over 
with, 
and 
I 
happen 
to 
be 
there, 
I'll 
go 
at 
once, 
to
be 
out 
of 
your 
way! 
Do 
go 
somewhere, 
anywhere... 
to 
the 
devil!" 
he
exclaimed, 
and 
immediately 
seizing 
him 
by 
the 
shoulder 
and 
looking
amiably 
into 
his 
face, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/fO7baib1kQqNG2.html">evidently</a> 
wishing 
to 
soften 
the 
rudeness 
of 
his
words, 
he 
added, 
"Don't 
be 
hurt, 
my 
dear 
fellow; 
you 
know 
I 
speak
from 
my 
heart 
as 
to 
an 
old 
acquaintance."

"Oh, 
don't 
mention 
it, 
Count! 
I 
quite 
understand," 
said 
Berg,
getting 
up 
and 
speaking 
in 
a 
muffled 
and 
guttural 
voice.

"Go 
across 
to 
our 
hosts: 
they 
invited 
you," 
added 
Boris.

Berg 
put 
on 
the 
cleanest 
of 
coats, 
without 
a 
spot 
or 
speck 
of 
dust,
stood 
before 
a 
looking 
glass 
and 
brushed 
the 
hair 
on 
his 
temples
upwards, 
in 
the 
way 
affected 
by 
the 
Emperor 
Alexander, 
and, 
having
assured 
himself 
from 
the 
way 
Rostov 
looked 
at 
it 
that

coat
