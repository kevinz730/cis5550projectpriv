mingled 
with
private 
vehicles.

At 
the 
bridge</h1>they 
all 
halted, 
waiting 
for 
those 
in 
front 
to 
get 
across.
From 
the 
bridge 
they 
had 
a 
view 
of 
endless 
lines 
of 
moving 
baggage
trains 
before 
and 
behind 
them. 
To 
the 
right, 
where 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
turns
near 
Neskuchny, 
endless 
rows 
of 
troops 
and 
carts 
stretched 
away 
into
the 
distance. 
These 
were 
troops 
of 
Beauharnais' 
corps 
which 
had 
started
before 
any 
of 
the 
others. 
Behind, 
along 
the 
riverside 
and 
across 
the
Stone 
Bridge, 
were 
Ney's 
troops 
and 
transport.

Davout's 
troops, 
in 
whose 
charge 
were 
the 
prisoners, 
were 
crossing 
the
Crimean 
bridge 
and 
some 
were 
already 
debouching 
into 
the 
Kaluga 
road.
But<p>
the 
baggage 
trains 
stretched 
out 
so 
that 
the 
last 
of 
Beauharnais'
train 
had 
not 
yet 
got 
out 
of 
Moscow 
and 
reached 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
when
the 
vanguard 
of 
Ney's 
army 
was 
already 
emerging 
from 
the 
Great 
Ordynka
Street.

When 
they 
had 
crossed 
the 
<a href="/cZl/ml75ReoD3VEt.html">Crimean</a> 
bridge 
the 
prisoners 
moved 
a 
few 
steps
forward, 
halted, 
and 
again 
moved 
on, 
and 
from 
all 
sides 
vehicles 
and 
men
crowded 
closer 
and 
closer 
together. 
They 
advanced 
the 
few 
hundred 
paces
that 
separated 
the 
bridge 
from 
the 
Kaluga 
road, 
taking 
more 
than 
an
hour 
to 
do 
so, 
and 
came 
out 
<a href="/aVzUge/tL2tEu0fLYk9W.html">upon</a> 
the 
square 
where 
the 
streets 
of 
the
Transmoskva 
ward 
and 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
converge, 
and 
the 
prisoners 
jammed
close 
together 
had 
to 
stand 
for 
some 
hours 
at 
that 
crossway. 
From 
all
sides, 
like 
the 
roar 
of 
the 
sea, 
were 
heard 
the 
rattle 
of 
wheels, 
the
tramp 
of 
feet, 
and 
incessant 
shouts 
of 
anger 
and 
abuse. 
Pierre 
stood
pressed 
against 
the 
wall 
of 
a 
charred 
house, 
listening 
to 
that 
noise
which<p>
mingled 
in 
his 
imagination 
with 
the 
roll 
of 
the 
drums.

To 
get 
a 
better 
view, 
several 
officer 
prisoners 
climbed 
onto 
the 
wall 
of
the 
half-burned 
house 
against 
which 
Pierre 
was 
leaning.

"What 
crowds! 
Just 
look 
at 
the 
crowds!... 
They've 
loaded 
goods 
even 
on
the 
cannon! 
Look 
there, 
those 
are 
furs!" 
they 
exclaimed. 
"Just 
see 
what
the 
blackguards 
have 
looted.... 
There! 
See 
what 
that 
one 
has 
behind
in 
the 
cart.... 
Why, 
those 
are 
settings 
taken 
from 
some 
icons, 
by
heaven!... 
Oh, 
the 
rascals!... 
See 
how 
that 
fellow 
has 
loaded
himself 
up, 
he 
can 
hardly 
walk! 
Good 
lord, 
they've 
even 
grabbed 
those
chaises!... 
See 
that 
fellow 
there 
sitting 
on 
the 
trunks.... 
Heavens!
They're 
fighting."

"That's 
right, 
hit 
him 
on 
the 
snout-on 
his 
snout! 
Like 
this, 
we
shan't 
get 
away 
before 
evening. 
Look, 
look 
there.... 
Why, 
that 
must 
be
Napoleon's 
own. 
See 
what 
horses! 
And 
the 
monograms 
with 
a 
crown! 
It's
like 
a 
portable 
house.... 
That 
fellow's 
dropped 
his 
sack 
and 
doesn't 
see
it. 
Fighting 
again... 
A 
woman 
with 
a 
baby, 
and 
not 
bad-looking 
either!
Yes, 
I 
dare 
say, 
that's 
the 
way 
they'll 
let 
you 
pass.... 
Just 
look,
there's 
no 
end 
to 
it. 
Russian 
wenches, 
by 
heaven, 
so 
they 
are! 
In
carriages-see 
how 
comfortably 
they've 
settled 
themselves!"

Again, 
as 
at 
the 
church 
in 
Khamovniki,<p>
a 
wave 
of 
general 
curiosity
bore 
all 
the 
prisoners 
forward 
onto 
the 
road, 
and 
Pierre, 
thanks 
to
his 
stature, 
saw 
over 
the 
heads 
of 
the 
others 
what 
so 
attracted 
their
curiosity. 
In 
three 
carriages 
involved 
among 
the 
munition 
carts, 
closely
squeezed 
together, 
sat 
women 
with 
rouged 
faces, 
dressed 
in 
glaring
colors, 
who 
were 
shouting 
something 
in 
shrill 
voices.

From 
the 
moment 
Pierre 
had 
recognized 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
mysterious
force 
nothing 
had 
seemed 
to 
him 
strange 
or 
dreadful: 
neither 
the 
corpse
smeared 
with 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Eh7mSaQt9Scb9.html">soot</a> 
for 
fun 
nor 
these 
women 
hurrying 
away 
nor 
the 
burned
ruins 
of 
Moscow. 
All 
that 
he 
now 
witnessed 
scarcely 
made 
an 
impression
on 
him-as 
if 
his 
soul, 
making 
ready 
for 
a 
hard 
struggle, 
refused 
to
receive 
impressions 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/qr1Kzb7vGF4NbF.html">that</a> 
might 
weaken 
it.
