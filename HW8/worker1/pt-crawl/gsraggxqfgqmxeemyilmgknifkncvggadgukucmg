"Go 
over</h1>that 
way, 
they're 
there. 
It's 
she! 
She 
kept 
on 
lamenting 
and
crying," 
continued 
the 
woman. 
"It's 
she. 
Here, 
this 
way!"

But 
Pierre 
was 
not 
listening 
to 
the 
woman. 
He 
had 
for 
some 
seconds 
been
intently 
watching 
what 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bfW1mbEd8npky.html">was</a> 
going 
on 
a 
few 
steps 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Te7wUl7SFG4.html">away.</a> 
He 
was 
looking 
at
the 
Armenian 
family 
and 
at 
two 
French 
soldiers 
who 
had 
<a href="/nocrawl/aVzUge/fe4fCtXF9Gbiq9ReoD.html">gone</a> 
up 
to 
them.
One 
of 
these, 
a 
nimble 
little 
man, 
was 
wearing 
a 
blue 
coat 
tied 
round
the 
waist 
with 
a 
rope. 
He 
had 
a 
nightcap 
on 
his 
head 
and 
his 
feet 
were
bare. 
The 
other, 
whose 
appearance 
particularly 
struck 
Pierre, 
was 
a
long, 
lank, 
round-shouldered, 
fair-haired 
man, 
slow 
in 
his 
movements
and 
with 
an 
idiotic 
expression 
of 
face. 
He 
wore 
a 
woman's 
loose 
gown
of 
frieze, 
blue 
trousers, 
and 
large 
torn 
Hessian 
boots. 
The 
little
barefooted 
Frenchman 
in 
the 
blue 
coat 
went 
up 
to 
the 
Armenians 
and,
saying 
something, 
immediately 
seized 
the<p>
old 
man 
by 
his 
legs 
and 
the 
old
man 
at 
once 
began 
pulling 
off<p>
his 
boots.
