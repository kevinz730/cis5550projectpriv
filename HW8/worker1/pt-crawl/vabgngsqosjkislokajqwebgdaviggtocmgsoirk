his 
Serenity 
has 
been 
appointed,</h1>your
excellency," 
said 
Timokhin 
timidly, 
and 
continually 
turning 
to 
glance 
at
his 
colonel.

"Why 
so?" 
asked 
Pierre.

"Well, 
to 
mention 
only 
firewood 
and 
fodder, 
let 
me 
inform 
you. 
Why,<p>
when
we 
were 
retreating 
from 
Sventsyani 
we 
dare 
not 
touch 
a 
stick 
or 
a 
wisp
of 
hay 
or 
anything. 
You 
see, 
we 
were 
going 
away, 
so 
he 
would 
get 
it 
all;
wasn't 
it 
so, 
your 
excellency?" 
and 
again 
Timokhin 
turned 
to 
the 
prince.
"But 
we 
daren't. 
In 
our 
regiment 
two 
officers 
were 
court-martialed 
for
that 
kind 
of 
thing. 
But 
when 
his 
Serenity 
took<p>
command 
everything 
became
straightforward. 
Now 
we 
see 
light...."

"Then 
why 
was 
it 
forbidden?"

Timokhin 
looked 
about 
in 
confusion, 
not 
knowing 
what 
or 
how 
to 
answer
such 
a 
question. 
Pierre 
put 
the 
same<p>
question 
to 
Prince 
Andrew.

"Why, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
lay 
waste 
the 
country 
we 
were 
abandoning 
to 
the
enemy," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
venomous 
irony. 
"It 
is 
very 
sound:
one 
can't 
permit 
the 
land 
to 
be 
pillaged 
and 
accustom 
the 
troops 
to
marauding. 
At 
Smolensk 
too 
he 
judged 
correctly 
that 
the 
French 
might
outflank 
us, 
as 
they 
had 
larger 
forces. 
But 
he 
could 
not 
understand
this," 
cried 
Prince 
Andrew 
in 
a 
shrill 
voice 
that 
seemed 
to 
escape 
him
involuntarily: 
"he 
could 
not 
understand 
that 
there, 
for 
the 
first 
time,
we 
were 
fighting 
for 
Russian 
soil, 
and 
that 
there 
was 
a 
spirit 
in 
the
men 
such 
as 
I 
had 
never 
seen 
before, 
that 
we<p>
had 
held 
the 
French 
for
two 
days, 
and 
that 
that 
success 
had 
increased 
our 
strength 
tenfold. 
He
ordered<p>
us 
to 
retreat, 
and 
all 
our 
efforts 
and 
losses 
went 
for 
nothing.
He 
had 
no 
thought 
of 
betraying 
us, 
he 
tried 
to 
do 
the 
best 
he 
could,
he 
thought 
out 
everything, 
and 
that 
is 
why 
he 
is 
unsuitable. 
He 
is
unsuitable 
now, 
just 
because 
he 
plans 
out 
everything 
very 
thoroughly 
and
accurately 
as 
every 
German 
has 
to. 
How 
can 
I 
explain?... 
Well, 
say 
your
father 
has 
a 
German 
valet, 
and 
he 
is 
a 
splendid 
valet 
and 
satisfies 
your
father's 
requirements 
better 
than 
you 
could, 
then 
it's 
all 
right 
to 
let
him 
serve. 
But 
if 
your 
father 
is 
mortally 
sick 
you'll 
send 
the 
valet
away 
and 
attend 
to 
your 
father 
with 
your 
own 
unpracticed, 
awkward 
hands,
and 
will 
soothe 
him 
better 
than 
a 
skilled 
man 
who 
is 
a 
stranger 
could.
So 
it 
has 
been 
with 
Barclay. 
While 
Russia 
was 
well, 
a 
foreigner 
could
serve 
her 
and 
be 
a 
splendid 
minister; 
but 
as 
soon 
as 
she 
is 
in 
danger
she 
needs 
one 
of 
her 
own 
kin. 
But 
in 
your 
Club 
they 
have 
been 
making 
him
out 
a 
traitor! 
<a href="/aVzUge/ZUI6tQp05Akk.html">They</a> 
slander 
him 
as 
a 
traitor, 
and 
the 
only 
result 
will
be 
that 
afterwards, 
ashamed 
of 
their 
false 
accusations, 
they 
will 
make
him 
out 
a 
hero 
or 
a 
genius 
instead 
of 
a 
traitor, 
and 
that 
will 
be 
still
more 
unjust. 
He 
is 
an 
honest 
and 
very 
punctilious 
German."

"And 
they 
say 
he's 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mRO4NbF2f5As.html">a</a> 
skillful 
commander," 
rejoined 
Pierre.

"I 
don't 
understand 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
'a 
skillful 
commander,'" 
replied
Prince 
Andrew 
ironically.

"A 
skillful 
commander?" 
replied 
Pierre. 
"Why, 
one 
who 
foresees 
all
contingencies... 
and 
foresees 
the 
adversary's 
intentions."

"But 
that's 
impossible," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
matter
settled 
long 
ago.

Pierre 
looked 
at 
him<p>
in 
surprise.

"And 
yet 
they 
say 
that 
war 
is<p>
like 
a 
game 
of<p>
chess?" 
he 
remarked.

"Yes," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew,
