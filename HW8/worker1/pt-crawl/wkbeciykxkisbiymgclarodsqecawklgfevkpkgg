of
killing 
a 
man 
as</h1>the 
result 
of 
recognizing 
his 
rights, 
and 
the 
killing
of 
millions 
in 
Russia 
for 
the 
humiliation 
of 
England. 
But 
these
justifications 
have 
a 
very 
necessary 
significance 
in 
their 
own 
day.

These 
justifications 
release 
those 
who 
produce 
the 
events 
from 
moral
responsibility. 
These 
temporary 
aims 
are 
like 
the 
broom 
fixed 
in 
front
of 
a 
locomotive 
to 
clear 
the 
snow 
from 
the 
rails 
in 
front: 
they 
clear
men's 
moral 
responsibilities 
from 
their 
path.

Without 
such 
justification 
there 
would 
be 
no 
reply 
to 
the 
simplest
question 
that 
presents 
itself 
when 
examining 
each 
historical 
event. 
How
is 
it 
that 
millions 
of 
men 
commit 
collective 
crimes-make 
war, 
commit
murder, 
and 
so 
on?

With 
the 
present 
complex 
forms 
of 
political 
and 
social 
life 
in 
Europe
can 
any 
event 
that 
is 
not 
prescribed, 
decreed, 
or 
ordered 
by 
monarchs,
ministers, 
parliaments, 
or 
newspapers 
be 
imagined? 
Is 
there 
any
collective 
action 
which 
cannot 
find 
its 
justification 
in 
political
unity, 
in 
patriotism, 
in 
the 
balance 
of 
power, 
or 
in 
civilization? 
So
that 
every 
event 
that 
occurs 
inevitably 
coincides 
with 
some 
expressed
wish 
and, 
receiving 
a 
justification, 
presents 
itself 
as 
the 
result 
of
the 
will 
of 
one 
man 
or 
of 
several 
men.

direction
