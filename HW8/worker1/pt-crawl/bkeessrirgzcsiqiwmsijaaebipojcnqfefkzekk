it 
ever 
happen 
to 
you 
to
feel 
as 
if 
there 
were 
nothing 
more 
to 
come-nothing; 
that 
everything
good 
is 
past? 
And 
to 
feel 
not 
exactly 
dull, 
but 
sad?"

"I 
should 
think 
so!" 
he 
replied. 
"I 
have 
felt 
like 
that 
when
everything 
was 
all 
right 
and 
everyone 
was 
cheerful. 
The 
thought 
has 
come
into 
my 
mind 
that 
I 
was 
already 
tired 
of 
it 
all, 
and 
that 
we 
must 
all
die. 
Once 
in 
the 
regiment 
I 
had 
not 
gone 
to 
some 
merrymaking 
where 
there
was 
music... 
and<p>
suddenly 
I 
felt 
so 
depressed..."

"Oh 
yes, 
I 
know, 
I 
know, 
I 
know!" 
Natasha 
interrupted 
him. 
"When
I 
was 
quite<p>
little 
that 
used 
to 
be 
so 
with 
me. 
Do 
you 
remember 
when
I 
was 
punished 
once 
about 
some 
plums? 
You 
were 
all 
dancing, 
and 
I 
sat
sobbing 
in 
the 
schoolroom? 
I 
shall 
never 
forget 
it: 
I 
felt 
sad 
and 
sorry
for 
everyone, 
for 
myself, 
and 
for 
everyone. 
And 
I 
was 
innocent-that
was 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rg15uFRs2Qc.html">the</a> 
chief 
thing," 
said 
Natasha. 
"Do 
you 
remember?"

"I 
remember," 
answered 
Nicholas. 
"I 
remember 
that 
I<p>
came 
to 
you
afterwards 
and 
wanted 
to 
comfort 
you, 
but 
do 
you 
know,<p>
I 
felt 
ashamed
to. 
We 
were 
terribly 
absurd. 
I 
had 
a 
funny 
doll 
then 
and 
wanted 
to 
give
it 
to 
you. 
Do 
you 
remember?"

"And 
do 
you 
remember," 
Natasha 
asked 
with 
a 
pensive 
smile, 
"how
once, 
long, 
long 
ago, 
when 
we 
were 
quite 
little, 
Uncle 
called 
us 
into
the 
study-that 
was 
in 
the 
old 
house-and 
it 
was 
dark-we 
went 
in 
and
suddenly 
there 
stood..."

"A 
Negro," 
chimed 
in 
Nicholas 
<a href="/aVzUge/HIM9vxtj60IgdEd.html">with</a> 
a 
smile 
of 
delight. 
"Of 
course
I 
remember. 
Even 
now 
I 
don't 
know 
whether 
there 
really 
was 
a 
Negro, 
or
if 
we 
only 
dreamed 
it 
or 
were 
told 
about 
him."

"He 
was 
gray, 
you 
remember, 
and 
had 
white 
teeth, 
and 
stood 
and 
looked
at 
us...."

"Sonya, 
do 
you 
remember?" 
asked 
Nicholas.

"Yes, 
yes, 
I 
do<p>
remember 
something 
too," 
Sonya 
answered 
timidly.

"You 
know 
I 
have 
asked 
Papa 
and 
Mamma 
about 
that 
Negro," 
said
Natasha, 
"and 
they 
say 
there 
was 
no 
Negro 
at 
all. 
But 
you 
see, 
you
remember!"

"Of 
course 
I 
do, 
I 
remember 
his 
teeth 
as 
if 
I 
had 
just 
seen 
them."

"How 
strange 
it 
is! 
It's 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
dream! 
I 
like 
that."

"And 
do 
you 
remember 
how 
we 
rolled 
hard-boiled 
eggs 
in 
the 
ballroom,
and 
suddenly 
two 
old 
women 
began 
spinning 
round 
on 
the 
carpet? 
Was 
that
real 
or 
not? 
Do 
you 
remember 
what 
fun 
it 
was?"

"Yes, 
and 
you 
remember 
how 
Papa 
in 
his 
<a href="/aVzUge/Zhu4x3pbE.html">blue</a> 
overcoat 
fired 
a 
gun 
in
the 
porch?"

So 
they 
went 
through 
their 
memories, 
smiling 
with 
pleasure: 
not 
the 
sad
memories 
of 
old 
age, 
but 
poetic, 
youthful 
ones-those 
impressions 
of
one's 
most 
distant 
past 
in 
which 
dreams 
and 
realities 
blend-and 
they
laughed 
with 
quiet 
enjoyment.

Sonya, 
as 
always, 
did 
not 
quite 
keep 
pace 
with 
them, 
though 
they 
shared
the 
same 
reminiscences.

Much 
that
