"What 
do</h1>you 
think 
of 
it, 
Prince?" 
Dessalles 
ventured 
to 
ask.

"I? 
I?..." 
said 
the 
prince 
as 
if 
unpleasantly 
awakened, 
and 
not 
taking
his 
eyes 
from 
the 
plan 
of 
the 
building.

"Very 
possibly 
the 
theater 
of 
war 
will 
move 
so 
near 
to 
us 
that..."

"Ha 
ha 
ha! 
The 
theater 
of 
war!" 
said 
the 
prince. 
"I 
have 
said 
and 
still
say 
that 
the 
theater 
of 
war 
is 
Poland 
and 
the 
enemy 
will 
never 
get
beyond 
the 
Niemen."

Dessalles 
looked 
in 
amazement 
at 
the 
prince, 
who 
was 
<a href="/cZl/ez6WorqI7Bh6hoZsa.html">talking</a> 
of 
the
Niemen 
when 
the 
enemy 
was 
already 
at 
the 
Dnieper, 
but 
Princess 
Mary,
forgetting 
the 
geographical 
position 
of 
the 
Niemen, 
thought 
that 
what
her 
father 
was 
saying 
was 
correct.

"When 
the 
snow 
melts 
they'll 
sink 
in 
the 
Polish 
swamps. 
Only 
they
could 
fail 
to 
see 
it," 
the 
prince 
continued, 
evidently 
thinking 
of 
the
campaign 
of 
1807 
which 
seemed 
to 
him 
so 
recent. 
"Bennigsen 
should 
have
advanced 
into 
Prussia 
sooner,
