bending 
over</h1>to 
Alpatych. 
"You
must 
go 
away 
too, 
take 
away 
what 
you 
can 
and 
tell 
the 
serfs 
to 
go 
to 
the
Ryazan 
estate 
or 
to 
the 
one 
near 
Moscow."

Alpatych 
clung 
to 
Prince 
Andrew's 
leg 
and 
burst 
into 
sobs. 
Gently
disengaging 
himself, 
the 
prince 
spurred 
his 
horse 
and 
rode 
down 
the
avenue 
at 
a 
gallop.

The 
old 
man 
was 
still 
sitting 
in 
the 
ornamental 
garden, 
like 
a 
fly
impassive 
on 
the 
face 
of 
a 
loved 
one 
who 
is 
dead, 
tapping 
the 
last 
on
which 
he 
was 
making 
the 
bast 
shoe, 
and 
two 
little 
girls, 
running 
out
from 
the 
hot 
house 
carrying 
in 
their 
skirts 
plums 
they 
had 
plucked 
from
the 
trees 
there, 
came 
upon 
Prince 
Andrew. 
On 
seeing 
the 
young 
master,
the 
elder 
one 
with 
frightened 
look 
clutched 
her 
younger 
companion 
by 
the
hand 
and 
hid 
with 
her 
behind 
a 
birch 
tree, 
not 
stopping 
to 
pick 
up 
some
green 
plums 
they 
had 
dropped.

Prince 
Andrew 
turned 
away 
with 
startled 
haste, 
unwilling 
to 
let 
them
see 
that 
they 
had 
been 
observed. 
He 
was 
sorry 
for 
the 
pretty 
frightened
little 
girl, 
was 
afraid 
of 
looking 
at 
her, 
and 
yet 
felt 
an 
irresistible
desire 
to 
do 
so. 
A 
new 
sensation<p>
of 
comfort 
and 
relief 
came 
over 
him
when, 
seeing 
these 
girls, 
he 
realized 
the 
existence 
of 
other 
human
interests 
entirely 
aloof 
from 
his 
own 
and 
just 
as 
legitimate 
as 
those
that 
occupied 
him. 
Evidently 
these 
girls 
passionately 
desired 
one
thing-to 
carry 
away 
and 
eat 
those 
green 
plums 
without 
being 
caught-and
Prince 
Andrew 
shared 
their 
wish 
for 
the 
success 
of 
their 
enterprise. 
He
could 
not 
resist 
looking 
at 
them 
once 
more. 
Believing 
their 
danger 
past,
they 
sprang 
from 
their 
ambush 
and, 
chirruping 
something 
in 
their 
shrill
little 
voices 
and 
holding 
up 
their 
skirts,<p>
their 
bare 
little 
sunburned
feet 
scampered 
merrily 
and 
quickly 
across 
the 
meadow 
grass.

Prince 
Andrew 
was 
somewhat 
refreshed 
by 
having<p>
ridden 
off 
the 
dusty
highroad 
along 
which 
the 
troops 
were 
moving. 
But 
not 
far 
from 
Bald 
Hills
he 
again 
came 
out 
on 
the 
road 
and 
overtook 
his 
regiment 
at 
its 
halting
place 
by 
the 
dam 
of 
a 
small 
pond. 
It 
was 
past 
one 
o'clock. 
The 
sun,
a 
red 
ball 
through 
the 
dust, 
burned 
and 
scorched 
his 
back 
intolerably
through 
his 
black 
coat. 
The 
dust 
always 
hung 
motionless 
above 
the 
buzz
of 
talk 
that 
came 
from<p>
the 
resting 
troops. 
There 
was 
no 
wind. 
As 
he
crossed 
the 
dam 
Prince 
Andrew 
smelled 
the 
ooze 
and 
freshness 
of 
the
pond. 
He 
longed 
to 
get 
into 
that 
water, 
however 
dirty 
it 
might 
be, 
and
he 
glanced 
round 
at 
the 
pool 
from 
whence 
came 
sounds 
of 
shrieks 
and
laughter. 
The 
small, 
muddy, 
green 
pond 
had 
risen 
visibly
