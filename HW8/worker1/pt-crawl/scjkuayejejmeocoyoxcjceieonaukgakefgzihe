From 
the 
twenty-sixth 
of 
August
to 
the 
second 
of 
September, 
that 
is 
from 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino 
to 
the
entry 
of 
the 
French 
into 
Moscow, 
during 
the 
whole 
of 
that 
agitating,
memorable 
week, 
there 
had 
been 
the 
extraordinary 
autumn 
weather 
that
always 
comes 
as 
a 
surprise, 
when 
the 
sun 
hangs 
low 
and 
gives 
more 
heat
than 
in 
spring, 
when 
everything 
shines 
so 
brightly 
in 
the 
rare 
clear
atmosphere 
that 
the 
eyes 
smart, 
when 
the 
lungs 
are 
strengthened 
and
refreshed 
by 
inhaling 
the 
aromatic 
autumn 
air, 
when 
even 
the 
nights
are 
warm, 
and 
when 
in 
those 
dark 
warm 
nights, 
golden 
stars 
startle 
and
delight 
us 
continually 
by 
falling 
from 
the 
sky.

At 
ten 
in 
the 
morning 
of 
the 
second 
of 
September 
this 
weather 
still
held.

The 
brightness 
of 
the 
morning 
was 
magical. 
Moscow 
seen 
from 
the 
Poklonny
Hill 
lay 
spaciously 
spread 
out 
with 
her 
river, 
her 
gardens, 
and 
her
churches, 
and 
she 
seemed 
to 
be 
living 
her 
usual 
life, 
her 
cupolas
glittering 
like 
stars 
in 
the 
sunlight.

The 
view 
of 
the 
strange 
city 
with 
its 
peculiar 
architecture, 
such 
as
he 
had 
never 
seen 
before, 
filled 
Napoleon 
with 
the 
rather 
envious 
and
uneasy 
curiosity 
men 
feel 
when 
they 
see 
an 
alien 
form 
of 
life 
that 
has
no 
knowledge 
of 
them. 
This 
city 
was 
evidently 
living 
with 
the 
full 
force
of 
its 
own 
life. 
By 
the 
indefinite 
signs 
which, 
even 
at 
a 
distance,
distinguish 
a 
living 
body 
from 
a 
dead 
one, 
Napoleon 
from 
the 
Poklonny
Hill 
perceived 
the 
throb 
of 
life 
in<p>
the 
town 
and 
felt, 
as 
it 
were, 
the
breathing 
of 
that 
great 
and 
beautiful 
body.

Every 
Russian 
looking 
at 
Moscow 
feels 
her 
to 
be 
a 
mother; 
every
foreigner 
who 
sees 
her,<p>
even 
if 
ignorant 
of 
her 
significance 
as 
the
mother 
city, 
must 
feel 
her 
feminine 
character, 
and 
Napoleon 
felt 
it.

"Cette 
ville 
asiatique 
aux 
innombrables 
eglises, 
Moscou 
la 
sainte. 
La
voila 
donc 
enfin, 
cette 
fameuse 
ville! 
Il 
etait 
temps," 
* 
said 
he, 
and
dismounting 
he 
ordered<p>
a 
plan 
of 
Moscow 
to 
be 
spread 
out 
before 
him, 
and
summoned 
Lelorgne 
d'Ideville, 
the 
interpreter.

 
 
 
 
 
* 
"That 
Asiatic 
city 
of 
the 
innumerable 
churches, 
holy
 
 
 
 
 
Moscow! 
Here 
it 
is 
then 
at 
last, 
that 
famous 
city. 
It 
was
 
 
 
 
 
high 
time."


"A 
town 
captured 
by 
the 
enemy 
is 
like 
a 
maid 
who 
has 
lost 
her 
honor,"
thought 
he 
(he 
had 
said 
so 
to 
Tuchkov 
at 
Smolensk). 
From 
that 
point 
of
view 
he 
gazed 
at 
the 
Oriental 
beauty 
he 
had 
not 
seen 
before. 
It 
seemed
strange 
to 
him 
that 
his 
long-felt 
wish, 
which 
had 
seemed 
unattainable,
had 
at 
last 
been 
realized. 
In 
the 
clear 
morning 
light 
he 
gazed 
now 
at
the 
city 
and 
now 
at 
the 
plan, 
considering<p>
its 
details, 
and 
the 
assurance
of 
possessing 
it 
agitated 
and<p>
awed 
him.

"But 
could 
it 
be 
otherwise?" 
he 
thought. 
"Here 
is 
this 
capital 
at 
my
feet. 
Where 
is 
Alexander 
now, 
and 
of 
what 
is 
he<p>
thinking? 
A 
strange,
beautiful, 
and 
majestic 
city; 
and 
a 
strange 
and 
majestic 
moment! 
In 
what
light 
must 
I 
appear 
to 
them!" 
thought 
he, 
thinking 
of 
his 
troops.
"Here 
she 
is, 
the 
reward 
for 
all 
those 
fainthearted 
men," 
he 
reflected,
glancing
