Kutuzov 
felt</h1>and 
knew-not 
by 
reasoning 
or 
science 
but 
with 
the 
whole 
of
his 
Russian 
being-what 
every 
Russian 
soldier 
felt: 
that 
the 
French 
were
beaten, 
that 
the 
enemy 
was 
flying 
and<p>
must 
be 
driven 
out; 
but 
at 
the
same 
time 
he 
like 
the 
soldiers 
realized 
all 
the 
hardship 
of 
this 
march,
the 
rapidity 
of 
which 
was 
unparalleled 
for<p>
such 
a 
time 
of 
the 
year.

But 
to 
the 
generals, 
especially 
the 
foreign 
ones 
in 
the 
Russian 
army,
who 
wished 
to 
distinguish 
themselves, 
to 
astonish 
somebody, 
and 
for 
some
reason 
to 
capture 
a 
king 
or 
a 
duke-it 
seemed 
that 
now-when 
any 
battle
must 
be 
horrible 
and 
senseless-was 
the 
very 
time 
to 
fight 
and 
conquer
somebody. 
Kutuzov 
merely 
shrugged 
his 
shoulders 
when 
one 
after
another 
they 
presented 
projects 
of 
maneuvers 
to 
be 
made 
with 
those
soldiers-ill-shod, 
insufficiently 
clad, 
and 
half 
starved-who 
within 
a
month 
and 
without 
fighting 
a 
battle 
had 
dwindled 
to 
half 
their 
number,
and 
who 
at 
the 
best 
if 
the 
flight 
continued 
would 
have 
to 
go 
a<p>
greater
distance 
than 
they 
had 
already 
traversed, 
before 
they 
reached 
the
frontier.

This 
longing 
to 
distinguish 
themselves, 
to 
maneuver, 
to 
overthrow, 
and
to 
cut 
off 
showed 
itself 
particularly 
whenever 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UK9Z7Uo.html">Russians</a> 
stumbled 
on
the 
French 
army.

So 
it 
was 
at 
Krasnoe, 
where 
they 
expected 
to 
find 
one 
of 
the 
three
French 
columns 
and 
stumbled 
instead<p>
on 
Napoleon 
himself 
with 
sixteen
thousand 
men. 
Despite 
all 
Kutuzov's 
efforts 
to 
avoid 
that 
ruinous
encounter 
and 
to 
preserve 
his 
troops,<p>
the 
massacre 
of 
the 
broken 
mob
of 
French 
soldiers 
by 
worn-out 
Russians 
continued 
at 
Krasnoe 
for 
three
days.

Toll 
wrote 
a 
disposition: 
"The 
first 
column 
will 
march 
to 
so 
and 
so,"
etc. 
And 
as 
usual 
nothing 
happened<p>
in 
accord 
with 
the 
disposition.
Prince 
Eugene 
of 
Wuerttemberg 
fired 
from 
a 
hill 
over 
the 
French 
crowds
that 
were 
running 
past, 
and 
demanded 
reinforcements 
which 
did 
not
arrive. 
The 
French, 
avoiding 
the 
Russians, 
dispersed 
and 
hid 
themselves
in 
the 
forest 
by 
night, 
making 
their 
way 
round 
as 
best 
they 
could, 
and
continued 
their 
flight.

Miloradovich, 
who 
said 
he 
did 
not 
want 
to 
know 
anything 
about 
the
commissariat 
affairs 
of 
his 
detachment, 
and 
could 
never 
be 
found 
when
he 
was 
wanted-that 
chevalier 
sans 
peur 
et 
sans 
reproche 
* 
as 
he 
styled
himself-who 
was 
fond 
of 
parleys 
with 
the 
French, 
sent 
envoys 
demanding
their 
surrender, 
wasted 
time, 
and 
did 
not 
do 
what 
he 
was 
ordered 
to 
do.

Knight 
without

"I 
give 
you 
that 
column, 
lads," 
he 
said, 
riding 
up 
to 
the 
troops 
and
pointing 
out 
the 
French 
to 
the 
cavalry.

And 
the 
cavalry, 
with 
spurs 
and 
sabers 
urging 
on 
horses 
that 
could
scarcely 
move, 
trotted 
with 
much 
<a href="/cZl/XH6HV6It6R.html">effort</a> 
to 
the 
column<p>
presented
to 
them-that 
is 
to 
say, 
to 
a 
crowd 
of 
Frenchmen 
stark 
with 
cold,
frost-bitten, 
and 
starving-and 
the 
column 
that 
had 
been 
presented 
to
them 
threw 
down 
its 
arms 
and 
surrendered 
as 
it 
had 
long 
been 
anxious 
to
do.

At 
Krasnoe 
they 
took 
twenty-six 
thousand 
prisoners, 
several 
hundred
cannon, 
and 
a 
stick 
called 
a 
"marshal's 
staff,"
