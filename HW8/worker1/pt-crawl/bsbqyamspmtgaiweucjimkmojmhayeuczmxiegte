On 
the 
right 
of 
the 
battery 
soldiers 
shouting
"Hurrah!" 
were 
running 
not 
forwards 
but 
backwards, 
it 
seemed 
to 
Pierre.

A 
cannon 
ball 
struck 
the 
very 
end 
of 
the 
earth 
work 
by 
which 
he 
was
standing, 
crumbling 
down 
the 
earth; 
a 
black 
ball 
flashed 
before<p>
his 
eyes
and 
at 
the 
same 
instant 
plumped 
into 
something. 
Some 
militiamen 
who 
were
entering 
the 
battery 
ran 
back.

"All 
with 
grapeshot!" 
shouted 
the 
officer.

The 
sergeant 
ran 
up 
to 
the 
officer 
and 
in 
a 
frightened 
whisper 
informed
him 
(as 
a 
butler 
at 
dinner 
informs 
his 
master 
that 
<a href="/cZl/CM9vGX9bf1.html">there</a> 
is 
no 
more 
of
some 
wine 
asked 
for) 
that 
there 
were 
no 
more 
charges.

"The 
scoundrels! 
What 
are 
they 
doing?" 
shouted 
the 
officer, 
turning 
to
Pierre.

The 
officer's 
face 
was 
red 
and 
perspiring 
and 
his 
eyes 
glittered 
under
his 
frowning 
brow.

"Run 
to 
the 
reserves 
and 
bring 
up 
the 
ammunition 
boxes!" 
he 
yelled,
angrily 
avoiding 
Pierre 
with 
his 
eyes 
and 
speaking 
to 
his 
men.

"I'll 
go," 
said 
Pierre.

The 
officer, 
without 
answering 
him, 
strode 
across 
to 
the 
opposite 
side.

"Don't 
fire.... 
Wait!" 
he 
shouted.

The 
man 
who 
had 
been 
ordered 
to 
go 
for 
ammunition 
stumbled 
against
Pierre.

"Eh, 
sir, 
this 
is 
no 
place 
for 
you," 
said 
he, 
and 
ran 
down 
the 
slope.

Pierre 
ran 
after 
him, 
avoiding 
the 
spot 
where 
the 
young 
officer 
was
sitting.

One 
cannon 
ball, 
another, 
and 
a 
third 
flew 
over 
him, 
falling 
in 
front,
beside, 
and 
behind 
him. 
Pierre 
ran 
down 
the 
slope. 
"Where 
am 
I 
going?"
he 
suddenly 
asked 
himself 
when 
he 
was 
already 
near 
the 
green 
ammunition
wagons. 
He 
halted 
irresolutely, 
not 
knowing 
whether 
to 
return 
or 
go 
on.
Suddenly 
a 
terrible 
concussion 
threw 
him 
backwards 
to 
the 
ground. 
At 
the
same 
instant 
he 
was 
dazzled 
by<p>
a 
great 
flash 
of 
flame, 
and 
immediately 
a
deafening 
roar, 
crackling, 
and 
whistling 
made 
his 
ears 
tingle.

When 
he 
came 
to 
himself 
he 
was 
sitting 
on 
the 
ground 
leaning 
on 
his
hands; 
the 
ammunition 
wagons 
he 
had 
been 
approaching 
no 
longer 
existed,
only 
charred 
green 
boards 
and 
rags<p>
littered 
the 
scorched 
grass, 
and 
a
horse, 
dangling 
fragments 
of 
its<p>
shaft 
behind 
it, 
galloped 
past, 
while
another 
horse 
lay, 
like 
Pierre, 
on 
the 
ground, 
uttering 
prolonged 
and
piercing 
cries.





CHAPTER 
XXXII

Beside 
himself 
with 
terror 
Pierre 
jumped 
up 
and 
ran 
back 
to 
the 
battery,
as 
to 
the 
only 
refuge 
from 
the 
horrors 
that 
surrounded 
him.

On 
entering 
the 
earthwork 
he 
noticed 
that 
there 
were 
men 
doing 
something
there 
but 
that 
no 
shots 
were 
being 
fired 
from 
the 
battery. 
He 
had 
no
time 
to 
realize 
who 
these 
men 
were. 
He<p>
saw 
the 
senior<p>
officer 
lying 
on
the 
earth<p>
wall 
with 
his 
back 
turned 
as 
if 
he 
were 
examining 
something
down 
below 
and 
that 
one 
of 
the 
soldiers 
he 
had 
noticed 
before 
was
struggling 
forward 
shouting 
"Brothers!" 
and 
trying 
to 
free 
himself 
from
some 
men 
who 
were 
holding 
him 
by 
the 
arm. 
He 
also 
saw 
something 
else
that 
was 
strange.

But 
he 
had 
not 
time 
to 
realize 
that 
the 
colonel 
had 
been 
killed, 
that
the 
soldier 
shouting 
"Brothers!" 
was 
a 
prisoner, 
and 
that 
another 
man
had 
been 
bayoneted 
in 
the 
back 
before 
his 
eyes, 
for 
hardly 
had 
he 
run
into 
the 
redoubt 
before 
a 
thin, 
sallow-faced, 
perspiring 
man 
in 
a 
blue
uniform 
rushed<p>
<a href="/cZl/oOe57E0s.html">on</a> 
him 
sword 
in 
hand, 
shouting 
something. 
Instinctively
guarding 
against 
the 
shock-for 
they 
had 
been 
running 
together 
at 
full
speed 
before 
they 
saw 
one 
another-Pierre 
put 
out 
his 
hands 
and 
seized
the 
man 
(a 
French 
officer) 
by 
the 
shoulder 
with 
one 
hand 
and 
by 
the
throat 
with 
the 
other.
