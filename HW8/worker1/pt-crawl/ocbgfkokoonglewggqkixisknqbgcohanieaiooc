had
suddenly 
appeared 
in</h1>the 
fog, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Cc3mGGRm7qQqw5.html">there</a> 
was 
a 
flash, 
followed 
by 
a 
report,
and 
a 
bullet 
whizzing 
high 
up 
in 
the 
mist 
with 
a 
plaintive 
sound 
passed
out 
of 
hearing. 
Another 
musket 
missed 
fire 
but 
flashed 
in 
the 
pan.
Rostov 
turned 
his 
horse 
and 
galloped 
back. 
Four 
more 
reports 
followed
at 
intervals, 
and 
the 
bullets 
passed 
somewhere 
in 
the 
fog 
singing 
in
different 
tones. 
Rostov 
reined 
in 
his 
horse, 
whose 
spirits 
had 
risen,
like 
his 
own, 
at 
the 
firing, 
and 
went 
back 
at 
a 
footpace. 
"Well, 
some
more! 
Some 
more!" 
a 
merry 
voice 
was 
saying 
in 
his 
soul. 
But 
no 
more
shots 
came.

Only 
when 
approaching 
Bagration 
did 
Rostov 
let 
his 
horse 
gallop 
again,
and 
with 
his 
hand 
at 
the 
salute 
rode 
up 
to 
the 
general.

Dolgorukov 
was 
still 
insisting 
that 
the 
French 
had 
retreated 
and 
had
only 
lit 
fires 
to 
deceive 
us.

"What 
does 
that 
prove?" 
he 
was 
saying 
as 
Rostov 
rode 
up. 
"They
might 
retreat 
and 
leave 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Wb49N5l.html">the</a> 
<a href="/cZl/Ig7yf7Ptam5q.html">pickets."

"It's</a> 
plain 
that 
they 
have 
not 
all 
gone 
yet, 
Prince," 
said
Bagration. 
"Wait 
till 
tomorrow 
morning, 
we'll 
find 
out 
everything
tomorrow."

"The 
picket 
is<p>
still 
on 
the 
hill, 
your 
excellency, 
just 
where 
it 
was
in 
the 
evening," 
reported 
Rostov, 
stooping 
forward 
with 
his 
hand 
at
the 
salute 
and 
unable 
to 
repress 
the 
smile 
of 
delight 
induced 
by 
his
ride 
and 
especially 
by 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
bullets.

"Very 
good, 
very 
good," 
said 
Bagration. 
"Thank 
you, 
officer."

"Your 
excellency," 
said 
Rostov, 
"may 
I 
ask 
a 
favor?"

"What 
is 
it?"

"Tomorrow 
our 
squadron 
is 
to 
be 
in 
reserve. 
May 
I 
ask 
to 
be 
attached
to 
the 
first 
squadron?"

"What's 
your 
name?"

"Count 
Rostov."

"Oh, 
very 
well, 
you 
may 
stay 
in 
attendance 
on 
me."

"Count 
Ilya 
Rostov's 
son?" 
asked 
Dolgorukov.

But 
Rostov 
did 
not 
reply.

"Then 
I 
may 
reckon 
on 
it, 
your 
excellency?"

"I 
will 
give 
the 
order."

"Tomorrow 
very 
likely 
I 
may 
be 
sent 
with 
<a href="/cZl/io9bKMVG1gcFtr4IEXzL.html">some</a> 
message 
to 
the
Emperor," 
thought 
Rostov.

"Thank 
God!"

The 
fires 
and 
shouting 
in 
the 
enemy's 
army 
were 
occasioned 
by 
the 
fact
that 
while 
Napoleon's 
proclamation 
was 
being 
read 
to 
the 
troops 
the
Emperor 
himself 
rode 
round 
his 
bivouacs. 
The 
soldiers, 
on 
seeing 
him,
lit 
wisps 
of 
straw 
and 
ran 
after 
him, 
shouting, 
"Vive 
l'Empereur!"
Napoleon's 
proclamation 
was 
as 
follows:

Soldiers! 
The 
Russian 
army 
is 
advancing 
against 
you 
to 
avenge 
the
Austrian<p>
army 
of 
Ulm.<p>
They 
are 
the 
same 
battalions 
you 
broke 
at
Hollabruenn 
and 
have 
pursued 
ever 
since 
to 
this 
place. 
The 
position 
we
occupy 
is 
a 
strong 
one, 
and 
while 
they 
are 
marching 
to 
go 
round 
me 
on
the 
right 
they 
will 
expose 
a 
flank 
to 
me. 
Soldiers! 
I 
will 
myself 
direct
your 
battalions. 
I 
will 
keep 
out 
of 
fire 
if 
you 
with 
your 
habitual
valor 
carry 
disorder 
and 
confusion 
into 
the 
enemy's 
ranks, 
but 
should
victory 
be 
in 
doubt, 
even 
for 
a 
moment, 
you 
will 
see 
your 
Emperor
exposing 
himself 
to 
the 
first 
blows 
of 
the 
enemy, 
for 
there 
must 
be 
no
doubt 
of 
victory, 
especially 
on 
this 
day<p>
when 
what 
is 
at 
stake 
is 
the
honor 
of 
the 
French 
infantry, 
so 
necessary 
<a href="/aVzUge/oWJ8tc62Jn.html">to</a> 
the 
honor 
of 
our 
nation.

Do 
not 
break 
your 
ranks 
on 
the 
plea 
of 
removing 
the 
wounded! 
Let 
every
man 
be 
fully 
imbued 
with 
the 
thought 
that 
we 
must 
defeat 
these 
hirelings
of 
England, 
inspired 
by 
such 
hatred 
of 
our 
nation! 
This 
victory 
will
conclude 
our 
campaign 
and 
we 
can 
return 
to 
winter 
quarters, 
where
