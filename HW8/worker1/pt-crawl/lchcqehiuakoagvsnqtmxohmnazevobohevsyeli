Prince 
Andrew
with 
a 
lady 
passed 
by, 
evidently 
not 
recognizing 
them. 
The 
handsome
Anatole 
was 
smilingly 
talking 
to 
a 
partner 
on 
his 
arm 
and 
looked 
at
Natasha 
as 
one 
looks 
at 
a 
wall. 
Boris 
passed 
them 
twice 
and 
each 
time
turned 
away. 
Berg 
and 
his 
wife, 
who 
were 
not 
dancing, 
came 
up 
to 
them.

This 
family 
gathering 
seemed 
humiliating 
to 
Natasha-as 
if 
there 
were
nowhere 
else 
for 
the 
family 
to 
talk 
but 
here 
at 
the 
ball. 
She 
did 
not
listen 
to 
or 
look 
at 
Vera, 
who 
was 
telling 
her 
something 
about 
her 
own
green 
dress.

At 
last 
the 
Emperor 
stopped 
beside 
his 
last 
partner 
(he 
had 
danced
with<p>
three) 
and 
the 
music 
ceased. 
A 
worried 
aide-de-camp 
ran 
up 
to 
the
Rostovs 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/CT4Vd1o8M.html">requesting</a> 
them 
to 
stand 
farther<p>
back, 
though 
as 
it 
was 
they
were 
already 
close 
to 
the 
wall, 
and 
from 
the 
gallery 
resounded 
the
distinct, 
precise, 
enticingly 
rhythmical 
strains 
of 
a 
waltz. 
The 
Emperor
looked 
smilingly 
down 
the 
room. 
A 
minute 
passed 
but 
no 
one 
had 
yet 
begun
dancing. 
An 
aide-de-camp, 
the 
Master 
of 
Ceremonies, 
went 
up 
to 
Countess
Bezukhova 
and 
asked 
her 
to 
dance. 
She 
smilingly 
raised 
her 
hand 
and
laid 
it 
on 
his 
shoulder 
without 
looking 
at 
him. 
The 
aide-de-camp, 
an
adept 
in 
his 
art, 
grasping 
his 
partner 
firmly 
round 
her 
waist, 
with
confident 
<a href="/cZl/yY6l5dZEO8hMvng.html">deliberation</a> 
started 
smoothly, 
gliding 
first 
round 
the 
edge 
of
the 
circle, 
then 
at 
the 
corner 
of 
the 
room 
he 
caught 
Helene's
left 
hand 
and 
turned 
her, 
the 
only 
sound 
audible, 
apart 
from 
the
ever-quickening 
music, 
being 
the 
rhythmic 
click 
of 
the 
spurs 
on 
his
rapid, 
agile 
feet, 
while 
at 
every 
third 
beat 
his 
partner's 
velvet
dress 
spread 
out 
and 
seemed 
to 
flash 
as 
she 
whirled 
round. 
Natasha
gazed 
at 
them 
and 
was 
ready 
to 
cry 
because 
it 
was 
not 
she 
who 
was
dancing 
that 
first 
turn<p>
of 
the 
waltz.

Prince 
Andrew, 
in 
the 
white 
uniform 
of 
a 
cavalry 
colonel, 
wearing
stockings 
and 
dancing 
shoes, 
stood 
looking 
animated 
and 
bright 
in 
the
front 
row 
of 
the 
circle 
not 
far 
from 
the 
Rostovs. 
Baron 
Firhoff 
was
talking 
to 
him 
about 
the 
first 
sitting 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
State 
to 
be
held 
next 
day. 
Prince 
Andrew, 
as 
one 
closely 
connected 
with 
Speranski
and 
participating 
in 
the 
work 
of 
the 
legislative 
commission, 
could 
give
reliable 
information 
about 
that 
sitting, 
concerning 
which 
various 
rumors
were 
current. 
But 
not 
listening 
to 
what 
Firhoff 
was 
saying, 
he 
was
gazing 
now 
at 
the 
sovereign 
and 
now 
at<p>
the 
men 
intending 
to 
dance 
who
had<p>
not 
yet 
gathered<p>
courage 
to 
enter 
the 
circle.

Prince 
Andrew 
was 
watching 
these 
men 
abashed 
by 
the 
Emperor's
presence, 
and 
the 
women 
who<p>
were 
breathlessly 
longing 
to 
be 
asked 
to
dance.

Pierre 
came 
up 
to 
him 
and 
caught 
him 
by 
the 
arm.

"You 
always 
dance. 
I 
have 
a 
protegee, 
the 
young 
Rostova, 
here. 
Ask
her," 
he 
said.

"Where 
is 
she?" 
asked 
Bolkonski. 
"Excuse 
me!" 
he 
added, 
turning
to 
the 
baron, 
"we 
will 
finish 
this 
conversation 
elsewhere-at<p>
a 
ball
one 
must 
dance." 
He 
stepped 
forward 
in 
the 
direction 
Pierre 
indicated.
The 
despairing, 
dejected 
expression 
of 
Natasha's 
face 
caught 
his 
eye.
He 
recognized 
her, 
guessed 
her 
feelings, 
saw 
that 
it 
was 
her<p>
debut,
remembered 
her 
conversation 
at 
the 
window, 
and 
with 
an 
expression 
of
pleasure 
on 
his 
face 
approached 
Countess 
Rostova.

"Allow 
me 
to 
introduce 
you 
to 
my 
daughter," 
said 
the 
countess, 
with
heightened 
color.

"I 
have 
the 
pleasure 
of 
being 
already 
acquainted, 
if 
the 
countess
remembers 
me," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
a 
low 
and 
courteous 
bow 
quite
belying 
Peronskaya's 
remarks 
about 
his 
rudeness, 
and 
approaching
Natasha 
he 
held 
out 
his 
arm 
to 
grasp 
her 
waist 
before 
he
