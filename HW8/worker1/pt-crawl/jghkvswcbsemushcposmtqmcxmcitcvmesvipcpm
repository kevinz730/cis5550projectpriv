I

I

"Now 
you 
don't 
know 
that 
at 
all!" 
said 
Nicholas. 
"But 
I 
must
talk 
to 
her. 
What 
a 
darling<p>
Sonya 
is!" 
he 
added 
with 
a 
smile.

"Ah, 
she 
is 
indeed 
a 
darling! 
I'll 
send 
her 
to 
you."

And 
Natasha 
kissed 
her 
brother 
and 
ran 
away.

A 
minute 
later 
Sonya 
came 
in 
with 
a 
frightened, 
guilty, 
and 
scared
look. 
Nicholas 
went 
up 
to 
her 
and 
kissed 
her 
hand. 
This 
was 
the 
first
time 
since 
his 
return 
that 
they 
had 
talked 
alone 
and 
about 
their 
love.

"Sophie," 
he 
began, 
timidly 
at 
first 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/zD34lOZ0.html">and</a> 
then 
more 
and 
more
boldly, 
"if 
you 
wish 
to 
refuse 
one 
who 
is 
not 
only 
a 
brilliant 
and
advantageous 
match 
but 
a 
splendid, 
noble 
fellow... 
he 
is 
my 
friend..."

Sonya 
interrupted 
him.

"I 
have 
already 
refused," 
she 
said 
hurriedly.

"If 
you 
are 
refusing 
for 
my 
sake, 
I 
am 
afraid 
that 
I..."

Sonya 
again 
interrupted. 
She 
gave 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oq7hpfx9gJL.html">him</a> 
an 
imploring, 
frightened 
look.

"Nicholas, 
don't 
tell 
me 
that!" 
she 
said.

"No, 
but 
I 
must. 
It 
may 
be 
arrogant 
of 
me, 
but 
still 
it 
is 
best 
to 
say
it.
