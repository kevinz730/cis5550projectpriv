cessation 
of 
that
movement 
when 
a 
rational 
and 
sacred 
aim 
for 
the 
Crusade-the 
deliverance
of 
Jerusalem-had 
been 
clearly 
defined 
by 
historic 
leaders. 
Popes, 
kings,
and 
knights 
incited 
the 
peoples 
to 
free 
the 
Holy 
Land; 
but 
the 
people
did 
not 
go, 
for 
the 
unknown 
cause 
which 
had 
previously 
impelled 
them 
to
go 
no 
longer 
existed. 
The 
history 
of 
the 
Godfreys 
and 
the 
Minnesingers
can 
evidently 
not 
cover 
the 
life 
of 
the 
peoples. 
And 
the 
history 
of 
the
Godfreys 
and 
the 
Minnesingers 
has 
remained 
the 
history 
of 
Godfreys
and 
Minnesingers, 
but 
the 
history 
of 
the 
life 
of 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/vx1R08LZ.html">peoples</a> 
and 
their
impulses 
has 
remained 
unknown.

Still 
less 
does 
the 
history 
of 
authors 
and 
reformers 
explain 
to 
us 
the
life 
of 
the 
peoples.

The 
history 
of 
culture 
explains 
to 
us 
the 
impulses 
and 
conditions 
of
life 
and 
thought 
of 
a 
writer 
or 
a 
reformer. 
We 
learn 
that 
Luther 
had
a 
hot 
temper 
and 
said 
such 
and 
such 
things; 
we 
learn 
that 
Rousseau 
was
suspicious 
and 
wrote 
such 
and 
such 
books; 
but 
we 
do 
not 
learn 
why 
after
the 
Reformation 
the 
peoples 
massacred 
one 
another, 
nor 
why 
during 
the
French 
Revolution 
<a href="/aVzUge/bmp3Url9qrwB.html">they</a> 
guillotined 
one 
another.

If 
we 
unite 
both 
these 
kinds 
of 
history, 
as 
is 
done 
by 
the 
newest
historians, 
we 
shall 
have 
the 
history 
of 
monarchs 
and 
writers, 
<a href="/aVzUge/hp8Ro6H8Fmd.html">but</a> 
not
the 
history 
of 
the 
life 
of 
the

CHAPTER 
V

The 
life 
of 
the 
nations 
is 
not 
contained 
in 
the 
lives 
of 
a 
few 
men, 
for
the 
connection 
between 
those 
men 
and 
the 
nations 
has 
not 
been 
found.
The 
theory 
that 
this 
connection 
is 
based 
on 
the 
transference 
of 
the
collective 
will 
of 
a 
people 
to 
certain 
historical 
personages 
is 
an
hypothesis 
unconfirmed 
by 
the 
experience 
of 
history.
