CHAPTER 
XIV

After 
receiving 
her 
visitors, 
the 
countess 
was 
so 
tired 
that 
she 
gave
orders 
to 
admit 
no 
more, 
but 
the 
porter 
was 
told 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hp3jM5Y3fY.html">be</a> 
sure 
to 
invite 
to
dinner 
all 
who 
came 
"to 
congratulate." 
The 
countess 
wished 
to 
have
a 
tete-a-tete 
talk 
with 
the 
friend 
of 
her 
<a href="/aVzUge/HIM9vxtj60IgdEd.html">childhood,</a> 
Princess 
Anna
Mikhaylovna, 
whom 
she 
had 
not 
seen 
properly 
since 
she 
returned 
from
Petersburg. 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
with 
her 
tear-worn 
but 
pleasant 
face,
drew 
her 
chair 
nearer 
to 
that 
of 
the 
countess.

"With 
you 
I 
will 
be 
quite 
frank," 
said 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna. 
"There
are 
not 
many 
left 
of 
<a href="/aVzUge/qQ69oFcgw4PUmnH.html">us</a> 
old 
friends! 
That's 
why 
I 
so 
value 
your
friendship."

Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
looked 
at 
Vera 
and 
paused. 
The 
countess 
pressed 
her
friend's 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rg15uFRs2Qc.html">hand.

"Vera,"</a> 
she<p>
said 
to 
her 
eldest 
daughter 
who 
<a href="/aVzUge/BA7QSaz1alHv5yxsz.html">was</a> 
evidently<p>
not 
a
favorite, 
"how 
is 
it 
you 
have 
so 
little 
tact? 
Don't 
you 
see 
you 
are
not 
wanted 
here? 
Go 
to 
the 
other 
girls, 
or..."

The 
handsome 
Vera 
smiled 
contemptuously 
but 
did 
not 
seem 
at 
all<p>
hurt.

"If 
you 
had 
told 
me 
sooner, 
Mamma, 
I 
would 
have 
gone," 
she 
replied
as 
she 
rose 
to 
go 
to 
her 
own 
room.

But 
as 
she 
passed 
the 
sitting 
room 
she 
noticed 
two 
couples 
sitting,
one 
pair 
at 
each 
window. 
She 
stopped 
and 
smiled 
scornfully. 
Sonya 
was
sitting 
close<p>
to 
Nicholas 
who 
was 
copying 
out 
some 
verses 
for 
her, 
the
first 
he 
had 
ever 
written. 
Boris 
and 
Natasha 
were 
at 
the 
other 
window
and 
ceased 
talking 
when 
Vera 
entered. 
Sonya 
and 
Natasha 
looked 
at
Vera 
with 
guilty, 
happy 
faces.

It 
was 
pleasant 
and 
touching 
to 
see 
these 
little 
girls 
in 
love; 
but
apparently 
the 
sight 
of 
them
