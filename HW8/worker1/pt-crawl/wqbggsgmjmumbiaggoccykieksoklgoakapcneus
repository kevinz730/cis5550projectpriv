Pierre 
saw 
that</h1>Prince 
Andrew 
was 
going 
to 
speak<p>
of 
Natasha, 
and 
his
broad 
face 
expressed 
pity 
and 
sympathy. 
This 
<a href="/cZl/uz8pVEYz1EwE4W.html">expression</a> 
irritated 
Prince
Andrew, 
and 
in 
a 
determined, 
ringing, 
and 
unpleasant 
tone 
he 
continued:

"I 
have 
received 
a 
refusal 
from 
Countess 
Rostova 
and 
have 
heard 
reports
of 
your 
brother-in-law 
having 
sought 
her 
hand, 
or 
something 
of 
that
kind. 
Is 
that 
true?"

"Both 
true 
and 
untrue," 
Pierre 
began; 
but 
Prince 
Andrew 
interrupted 
him.

"Here 
are 
her 
letters 
and 
her 
portrait," 
said 
he.

He 
took 
the 
packet 
from 
the 
table 
and 
handed 
it 
to 
Pierre.

"Give 
this 
to 
the 
countess... 
if 
you 
see 
her."

"She 
is 
very 
ill," 
said 
Pierre.

"Then 
she 
is 
here 
still?" 
said 
Prince 
<a href="/aVzUge/YE7mbEd9f4tHLaX.html">Andrew.</a> 
"And 
Prince 
Kuragin?" 
he
added 
quickly.

"He 
<a href="/aVzUge/EY78hoZsa0.html">left</a> 
long 
ago. 
She 
has 
been 
at 
death's 
door."

"I 
much 
regret 
her 
illness," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew; 
and 
he 
smiled 
like 
his
father, 
coldly, 
maliciously, 
and 
unpleasantly.

"So 
Monsieur 
Kuragin 
has 
not 
honored 
Countess 
Rostova 
with 
his 
hand?"
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
and 
he 
snorted 
several 
times.

"He 
could 
not 
marry, 
for 
he 
was 
married 
already," 
said 
Pierre.

Prince 
Andrew 
<a href="/aVzUge/AaD9zr76NFutM.html">laughed</a> 
disagreeably, 
again 
reminding 
one 
of 
his 
father.

"And 
where 
is 
your 
brother-in-law 
now, 
if 
I 
may 
ask?" 
he 
said.

"He 
has 
gone 
to 
Peters... 
But 
I 
don't 
know," 
said 
Pierre.

"Well, 
it 
doesn't 
matter," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew. 
"Tell 
Countess 
Rostova
that 
she 
was 
and 
is 
perfectly 
free 
and 
that 
I 
wish 
her 
all 
that 
is
good."

Pierre 
took 
the 
packet. 
Prince 
Andrew, 
as 
if 
trying 
to 
remember 
whether
he 
had 
something 
more 
to 
say, 
or 
waiting 
to 
see 
if 
Pierre 
would 
say
anything, 
looked 
fixedly 
at 
him.

"I 
say, 
do 
you 
remember 
our 
discussion 
in 
Petersburg?" 
asked 
Pierre,
"about..."

"Yes," 
returned 
Prince 
Andrew 
hastily. 
"I 
said 
that 
a 
fallen 
woman
should 
be 
forgiven, 
but 
I 
didn't 
say 
I 
could 
forgive 
her. 
I 
can't."

"But 
can 
this 
be 
compared...?" 
said 
Pierre.

Prince 
Andrew 
interrupted 
him 
and 
cried 
sharply: 
"Yes, 
ask 
her 
hand
again, 
be 
magnanimous, 
and 
so 
on?... 
Yes, 
that 
would 
be 
very 
noble, 
but
I 
am 
unable 
to 
follow 
in 
that 
gentleman's 
footsteps. 
If 
you 
wish 
to 
be
my 
friend 
never 
speak 
to 
me 
of 
that... 
of 
all 
that! 
Well, 
good-by. 
So
you'll 
give 
her 
the 
packet?"

Pierre 
left 
the 
room 
and 
went 
to 
the 
old 
prince 
and 
Princess 
Mary.

The 
old 
man 
seemed 
livelier 
than 
usual. 
Princess 
Mary 
was 
the 
same 
as
always, 
but 
beneath 
her 
sympathy 
for 
her 
brother, 
Pierre 
noticed 
her
satisfaction 
that 
the 
engagement 
had 
been 
broken 
off. 
Looking 
at 
them
Pierre 
realized 
what 
contempt 
and 
animosity 
they 
all 
felt 
for 
the
Rostovs, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
in 
their 
presence 
even 
to 
mention
the 
name 
of 
her 
who 
could 
give 
up 
Prince 
Andrew 
for 
<a href="/nocrawl/aVzUge/IDs5SDFV3ikR7vhjV.html">anyone</a> 
else.

At 
dinner 
the 
talk 
turned 
on 
the 
war, 
the 
approach 
of 
which 
was 
becoming
evident. 
Prince 
Andrew 
talked 
incessantly, 
arguing 
now 
with 
his 
father,
now 
with 
the 
Swiss 
tutor 
Dessalles, 
and 
showing 
an 
unnatural 
animation,
the 
cause 
of 
which 
Pierre 
so 
well<p>
understood.





CHAPTER 
XXII

That 
same 
evening 
Pierre 
went 
to 
the 
Rostovs' 
to 
fulfill 
the 
commission
entrusted 
to 
him. 
Natasha 
was 
in 
bed, 
the 
count 
at 
the 
club, 
and 
Pierre,
after 
giving 
the 
letters 
to 
Sonya, 
went 
to 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
who 
was
interested 
to 
know 
how 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
taken 
the 
news. 
Ten 
minutes
later 
Sonya 
came 
to 
Marya 
Dmitrievna.

"Natasha 
insists 
on 
seeing 
Count 
Peter 
Kirilovich," 
said 
she.

"But 
how? 
Are 
we 
to 
take 
him 
up 
to 
her? 
The 
room 
there 
has 
not 
been
tidied 
up."

"No, 
she 
has 
dressed 
and 
gone 
into 
the 
drawing 
room," 
said 
Sonya.

Marya 
Dmitrievna 
only 
shrugged 
her 
shoulders.

"When 
will 
her 
mother 
come? 
She 
has 
worried 
me 
to 
death! 
Now 
mind, 
don't
tell 
her 
everything!" 
said 
she 
to 
Pierre. 
"One 
hasn't 
the 
heart 
to 
scold
her, 
she 
is 
so 
much 
to 
be 
pitied, 
so 
much 
to 
be 
pitied."
