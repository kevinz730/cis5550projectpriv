hundred, 
sir, 
and</h1>they're 
always 
sending 
me 
fresh 
ones. 
There 
are 
four
hundred? 
Eh?" 
he 
asked, 
turning 
to 
the 
assistant.

The 
assistant 
looked 
fagged 
out. 
He 
was 
evidently 
vexed 
and 
impatient
for 
the 
talkative 
doctor 
to 
go.

"Major 
Denisov," 
Rostov 
said 
again. 
"He 
was 
wounded 
at
Molliten."

"Dead, 
I 
fancy. 
Eh, 
Makeev?" 
queried 
the 
doctor, 
in 
a 
tone 
of
indifference.

The 
assistant, 
however, 
did 
not 
confirm 
the 
doctor's 
words.

"Is 
he 
tall 
and 
with 
reddish 
hair?" 
asked 
the 
doctor.

Rostov 
described 
Denisov's 
appearance.

"There 
was 
one 
like 
that," 
said 
the 
doctor, 
as 
if 
pleased. 
"That
one 
is 
dead, 
I 
fancy. 
However, 
I'll 
look 
up 
our 
list. 
We 
had 
a 
list.
Have 
you 
got 
it, 
Makeev?"

"Makar 
Alexeevich 
has 
the 
list," 
answered 
the 
assistant. 
"But 
if
you'll 
step 
into 
the 
officers' 
wards 
you'll 
see 
for 
yourself,"
he 
added, 
turning 
to 
Rostov.

"Ah, 
you'd 
better 
not 
go, 
sir," 
said 
the 
doctor, 
"or 
you 
may
have 
to 
stay 
here 
yourself."

But 
Rostov 
bowed 
himself 
away 
from 
the 
doctor 
and 
asked 
the 
assistant
to 
show 
him 
the 
way.

"Only 
don't 
blame 
me!" 
the<p>
doctor 
shouted 
up 
after 
him.

Rostov 
and 
the 
assistant 
went 
into 
the 
dark 
corridor. 
The 
smell 
was 
so
strong 
there 
that 
Rostov 
held 
his 
nose 
and 
had 
to 
pause 
and 
collect
his 
strength 
before 
he 
could 
go 
on. 
A 
door 
opened 
to 
the 
right, 
and 
an
emaciated 
sallow 
man 
on 
crutches, 
barefoot 
and 
in 
underclothing, 
limped
out 
and, 
leaning 
against 
the 
doorpost, 
looked 
with 
glittering 
envious
eyes 
at 
those 
who 
were 
passing. 
Glancing 
in 
at 
the 
door, 
Rostov
saw 
that 
the 
sick 
and 
wounded 
were 
lying 
on 
the 
floor 
on 
straw 
and
overcoats.

"May 
I 
go 
in 
and 
look?"

"What 
is 
there 
to 
see?" 
said 
the 
assistant.

But, 
just 
because 
the 
assistant 
evidently 
did 
not 
want 
him 
to 
go 
in,
Rostov 
entered 
the 
soldiers' 
ward. 
The 
foul 
air, 
to 
which 
he 
had
already 
begun 
to 
get 
used 
in 
the 
corridor, 
was 
still 
stronger 
here. 
It
was 
a 
little 
different, 
more 
pungent, 
and 
one 
felt 
that 
this 
was 
where
it 
originated.

In 
the 
long 
room, 
brightly 
lit 
up 
by 
the 
sun 
through 
the 
large 
windows,
the 
sick 
and 
wounded 
lay 
in 
two 
rows 
with 
their 
heads 
to 
the 
walls, 
and
leaving 
a 
passage 
in 
the 
middle. 
Most 
of 
them 
were 
unconscious 
and
paid 
no 
attention 
to 
the 
newcomers. 
Those 
who 
were 
conscious 
raised
themselves 
or 
lifted 
their 
thin 
yellow 
faces, 
and 
all 
looked 
intently 
at
Rostov 
with 
the 
same 
expression 
of 
hope,
