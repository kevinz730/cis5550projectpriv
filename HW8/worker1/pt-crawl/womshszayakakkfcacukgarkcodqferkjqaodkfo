womshszayakakkfcacukgarkcodqferkjqaodkfo length 4 4218 page 4218 <h1>where 
the 
fight 
was</h1>beginning, 
there 
was 
still 
thick 
fog; 
on 
the
higher 
ground 
it 
was 
clearing, 
but 
nothing 
could 
be 
seen 
of 
what 
was
going 
on 
in 
front. 
Whether 
all 
the 
enemy 
forces 
were, 
as 
we 
supposed,
six 
miles 
away, 
or 
whether 
they<p>
were 
near 
by 
in 
that 
sea 
of 
mist, 
no 
one
knew 
till 
after 
eight 
o'clock.

It 
was 
nine 
o'clock 
in 
the 
morning. 
The 
fog 
lay 
unbroken 
like 
a 
sea
down 
below, 
but 
higher 
up 
at 
the 
village 
of 
Schlappanitz 
where 
Napoleon
stood 
with 
his 
marshals 
around 
him, 
it 
was 
quite 
light. 
Above 
him 
was
a 
clear 
blue 
sky, 
and 
the 
sun's 
vast 
orb 
quivered 
like 
a 
huge 
hollow,
crimson 
float 
on 
the 
surface 
of 
that 
milky 
sea 
of 
mist. 
The 
whole 
French
army, 
and 
even 
Napoleon 
himself 
with 
his 
staff, 
were 
not 
on 
the 
far 
side
of 
the 
streams 
<a href="/aVzUge/mbm6iCtOt1bvO1.html">and</a> 
hollows 
of 
Sokolnitz 
and 
Schlappanitz 
beyond 
which 
we
intended 
to 
take 
up 
our 
position 
and 
begin 
the 
action, 
but 
were 
on 
this
side, 
so 
close 
to 
our 
own 
forces 
that 
Napoleon 
with 
the 
naked 
eye 
could
distinguish 
a 
mounted 
man 
from 
one 
on 
foot. 
Napoleon, 
in 
the 
blue 
cloak
which 
he 
had<p>
worn 
on 
his 
Italian 
campaign, 
sat 
on 
his 
small 
gray 
Arab
horse 
a 
little<p>
in 
front 
of 
his 
marshals. 
He<p>
gazed 
silently 
at 
the 
hills
which 
seemed 
to 
rise 
out 
of 
the 
sea 
of 
mist 
and 
on 
which 
the 
Russian
troops 
were 
moving 
in 
the 
distance, 
and 
he 
listened 
to 
the 
sounds 
of
firing 
in 
the 
valley. 
Not 
a 
single 
muscle 
of 
his 
face-which 
in 
those
days 
was<p>
still 
thin-moved. 
His 
gleaming 
eyes 
were 
fixed 
intently 
on
one 
spot. 
His 
predictions 
were 
being 
justified. 
Part 
of 
the 
Russian
force 
had 
already 
descended 
into 
the 
valley 
toward 
the 
ponds 
and 
lakes
and 
part 
were 
leaving 
these 
Pratzen<p>
Heights 
which 
he 
intended 
to 
attack
and 
regarded 
as 
the 
key 
to 
the 
position. 
<a href="/cZl/ND8byQW61INH.html">He</a> 
saw 
over 
the 
mist 
that 
in
a 
hollow 
between 
two 
hills 
near 
the 
village 
of 
Pratzen, 
the 
Russian
columns, 
their 
bayonets 
glittering, 
were 
moving 
continuously 
in 
one
direction 
toward 
the 
valley 
and 
disappearing 
one 
after 
another 
into
the 
mist. 
From 
information 
he 
had 
received 
the 
evening 
before, 
from 
the
sound 
of 
wheels 
and 
footsteps 
heard 
by 
the 
outposts 
during 
the 
night,
by 
the 
disorderly 
movement 
of 
the 
Russian 
columns, 
and 
from 
all
indications, 
he 
saw 
clearly 
that 
the 
allies 
believed 
him 
to 
be 
far 
away
in 
front 
of 
them, 
and 
that 
the 
columns 
moving 
near 
Pratzen 
constituted
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/GZb4mEX0cLYU3mSaQt.html">center</a> 
of 
the 
Russian 
army, 
and 
that 
that 
center 
was 
already
sufficiently 
weakened 
to 
be 
successfully 
attacked. 
But 
still 
he 
did 
not
begin 
the 
engagement.

Today 
was 
a 
great 
day 
for 
him-the 
anniversary 
of 
his 
coronation.
Before 
dawn 
he 
had 
slept 
<a href="/cZl/HG89CBzhL.html">for</a> 
a 
few 
hours, 
and 
refreshed, 
vigorous, 
and
in 
good 
spirits, 
he 
mounted 
his 
horse 
and 
rode 
out 
into<p>
the 
field
in 
that 
happy 
mood 
in 
which 
everything 
seems 
possible 
and 
everything
succeeds. 
He 
sat 
motionless, 
looking 
at 
the 
heights 
visible 
above
the 
mist, 
and 
his 
cold 
face 
wore 
that 
special 
look 
of 
confident,
self-complacent 
happiness 
that 
one 
sees 
on 
the 
face 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NXJ5AHAK.html">a</a> 
boy 
happily
in 
love. 
The 
marshals 
stood 
behind 
him 
not 
venturing 
to 
distract 
his
attention. 
He 
looked 
now 
at 
the 
Pratzen 
Heights, 
now 
at 
the 
sun 
floating
up 
out 
of 
the 
mist.

When 
the 
sun 
had 
entirely 
emerged 
from 
the 
fog, 
and 
fields 
and 
mist 
were
aglow 
with 
dazzling 
light-as 
if 
he 
had 
only 
awaited 
this 
to 
begin 
the
action-he 
drew 
the 
glove 
from 
his 
shapely 
white 
hand, 
made 
a 
sign
with 
it 
to 
the 
marshals, 
and 
ordered 
the 
action 
to 
begin. 
The 
marshals,
accompanied 
by 
adjutants, 
galloped 
off
