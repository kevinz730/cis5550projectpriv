(there 
was 
plenty 
of 
money, 
though 
there 
was
no 
food), 
some 
with 
more 
innocent 
games, 
such 
as 
quoits 
and 
skittles.
The 
general 
trend 
of 
the 
campaign 
was 
rarely 
spoken 
of, 
partly 
because
nothing 
certain 
was 
known 
about 
it, 
partly 
because 
there 
was 
a 
vague
feeling 
that 
in 
the 
main 
it 
was 
going 
badly.

Rostov 
lived, 
as 
before, 
with 
Denisov, 
and 
since 
their 
furlough 
they
had 
become 
more 
friendly 
than 
ever. 
Denisov 
never 
spoke 
of 
Rostov's
family, 
but 
by 
the 
tender 
friendship 
his 
commander 
showed 
him, 
Rostov
felt 
that 
the 
elder 
hussar's 
luckless 
love 
for 
Natasha 
played 
a<p>
part
in 
strengthening 
their 
friendship. 
Denisov 
evidently 
tried 
to 
expose
Rostov 
to 
danger 
as 
seldom 
as 
possible, 
and 
after 
an 
action 
greeted 
his
safe 
return 
with 
evident<p>
joy. 
On 
one 
of 
his 
foraging 
expeditions, 
in
a 
deserted 
and 
ruined 
village 
to 
which 
he<p>
had 
come 
in 
search 
of
provisions, 
Rostov 
found 
a 
family 
consisting 
of 
an 
old 
Pole 
and 
his
daughter 
with 
an 
infant 
in 
arms. 
They 
were 
half 
clad, 
hungry, 
too 
weak
to 
get 
away 
on 
foot 
and 
had 
no 
means 
of 
obtaining 
a 
conveyance. 
Rostov
brought 
them 
to 
his 
quarters, 
placed 
them 
in 
his 
own 
lodging, 
and
kept 
them 
for 
some 
weeks 
while 
the 
old 
man 
was 
recovering. 
One 
of 
his
comrades, 
talking 
of 
women, 
began 
chaffing 
Rostov, 
saying 
that 
he 
was
more 
wily 
than 
any 
of 
them 
and 
that 
it 
would 
not 
be 
a 
bad 
thing 
if 
he
introduced 
to 
them 
the 
pretty 
Polish 
girl 
he 
had 
saved. 
Rostov 
took
the 
joke 
as 
an 
insult, 
flared 
up, 
and 
said 
such 
unpleasant 
things 
to 
the
officer 
that 
it 
was 
all 
Denisov 
could 
do 
to 
prevent 
a 
duel. 
When
the 
officer 
had 
gone 
away, 
Denisov, 
who 
did 
not 
himself 
know 
what
Rostov's 
relations 
with 
the 
Polish 
girl 
might 
be, 
began 
to 
upbraid
him 
for 
his 
quickness 
of 
temper, 
and 
Rostov 
replied:

"Say 
what 
you 
like.... 
She 
is 
like 
a 
sister 
to 
me, 
and 
I 
can't 
tell
you 
how 
it 
offended 
me... 
because... 
well, 
for 
that 
reason...."

Denisov 
patted 
him 
on 
the 
shoulder 
and 
began 
rapidly 
pacing 
the 
room
without 
looking 
at 
Rostov, 
as 
was 
his 
way 
at 
moments 
of 
deep 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UB3e1Gbiq7hBn.html">feeling.

"Ah,</a> 
what 
a 
mad 
bweed 
you 
Wostovs 
are!" 
he 
muttered, 
and 
Rostov
noticed 
tears 
in 
his 
eyes.





CHAPTER 
XVI

In 
April 
the 
troops 
were 
enlivened 
by 
news 
<a href="/cZl/mf16LgATt.html">of</a> 
the 
Emperor's 
arrival,
but 
Rostov 
had 
no 
chance 
of 
being 
present 
at 
the 
review 
he 
held 
at
Bartenstein, 
as 
<a href="/nocrawl/aVzUge/vVJ1JCLL3ka8WMYlo.html">the</a> 
Pavlograds 
were 
at 
the 
outposts 
far 
beyond 
that
place.

They 
were 
bivouacking. 
Denisov 
and 
Rostov 
were 
living 
in 
an 
earth 
hut,
dug 
out 
for 
them 
by 
the 
soldiers 
and 
roofed 
with 
branches 
and 
turf. 
The
hut 
was 
made 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EV6GCnw.html">in</a> 
the 
following 
manner, 
which 
had 
then 
come 
into 
vogue. 
A
trench 
was 
dug 
three 
and 
a 
half 
feet 
wide, 
four 
feet 
eight 
inches 
deep,
and 
eight 
feet 
long. 
At 
one 
end 
of 
the 
trench, 
steps<p>
were 
cut 
out 
and
these 
formed 
the 
entrance 
and 
vestibule. 
The 
trench 
itself 
was 
the 
room,
in 
which 
the 
lucky 
ones, 
such 
as
