at 
once 
began 
talking.</h1>He
had 
just 
heard 
particulars 
of 
that 
morning's 
sitting 
of 
the 
Council
of 
State 
opened 
by 
the 
Emperor, 
and 
he 
spoke 
of 
it 
enthusiastically. 
The
Emperor's 
speech 
had 
been 
extraordinary. 
It 
had 
been 
a 
speech 
such 
as
only 
constitutional 
monarchs 
deliver. 
"The 
Sovereign 
plainly 
said
that 
the 
Council 
and 
Senate 
are 
estates 
of 
the 
realm, 
he 
said 
that 
the
government 
must 
rest 
not 
on 
authority 
but 
on 
secure 
bases. 
The 
Emperor
said 
that 
the 
fiscal 
system 
must 
be 
reorganized 
and 
the 
accounts
published," 
recounted 
Bitski, 
emphasizing 
certain 
words 
and 
opening
his 
eyes 
significantly.

"Ah, 
yes! 
Today's 
events 
mark 
an 
epoch, 
the 
greatest 
epoch 
in 
our
history," 
he 
concluded.

Prince 
Andrew 
listened 
to 
the<p>
account 
of 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
Council 
of
State, 
which 
he 
had 
so 
impatiently 
awaited 
and 
to 
which 
he 
had 
attached
such 
importance, 
and 
was 
surprised 
that 
this 
event, 
now 
that 
it 
had
taken 
place, 
did 
not 
affect 
him, 
and 
even 
seemed 
quite 
insignificant. 
He
listened 
with 
quiet 
irony 
to 
Bitski's 
enthusiastic 
account 
of 
it. 
A
very 
simple 
thought 
occurred 
to 
him: 
"What 
does 
it 
matter 
to 
me 
or 
to
Bitski 
what 
the 
Emperor 
was 
pleased 
to 
say 
at 
the 
Council? 
Can 
all 
that
make 
me 
any 
happier 
or 
better?"

And 
this 
simple 
reflection 
suddenly 
destroyed 
all 
the 
interest 
Prince
Andrew 
had 
felt 
in 
the 
impending 
reforms. 
He 
was 
going 
to 
dine 
that
evening 
at 
Speranski's, 
"with 
only 
a 
few<p>
friends," 
as 
the 
host
had 
said 
when 
inviting 
him. 
The 
prospect 
of 
that 
dinner 
in 
the 
intimate
home 
circle 
of 
the 
man 
he 
so 
admired 
had 
greatly 
interested 
Prince
Andrew, 
especially 
as 
he 
had 
not 
yet 
seen 
Speranski 
in 
his 
domestic
surroundings, 
but 
now 
he 
felt 
disinclined 
to 
go 
to 
it.

At 
the 
appointed 
hour, 
however, 
he 
entered 
the 
modest 
house 
Speranski
owned 
in 
the 
Taurida 
Gardens. 
In 
the 
parqueted 
dining 
room 
of 
this 
small
house, 
remarkable 
for 
its 
extreme 
cleanliness 
(suggesting 
that 
of 
a
monastery), 
Prince 
Andrew, 
who 
was 
rather 
late, 
found 
the 
friendly
gathering 
of 
Speranski's 
intimate 
acquaintances 
already 
assembled
at 
five 
o'clock. 
There 
were 
no 
ladies<p>
present 
except 
Speranski's
little 
daughter 
(long-faced 
like 
her 
father) 
and 
her 
governess. 
The
other 
guests 
were 
Gervais, 
Magnitski, 
and 
Stolypin.
