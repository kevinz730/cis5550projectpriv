winning. 
He 
was
not 
vain. 
He 
did 
not 
mind 
what 
people 
thought 
of 
him. 
Still 
less 
could
he 
be 
accused 
of 
ambition. 
More 
than 
once 
he<p>
had 
vexed 
his 
father 
by
spoiling 
his 
own 
career, 
and 
he 
laughed 
at 
distinctions 
of 
all 
kinds. 
He
was 
not 
mean, 
and 
did 
not 
refuse 
anyone 
who 
asked 
of 
him. 
All 
he 
cared
about 
was 
gaiety 
and 
women, 
and 
as 
according 
to 
his 
ideas 
there
was 
nothing 
dishonorable 
in 
these 
tastes, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/RZ4R0suxK1vf.html">and</a> 
he 
was 
incapable 
of
considering 
what 
the 
gratification 
of 
his 
tastes 
entailed 
for 
others,
he 
honestly 
considered 
himself 
irreproachable, 
sincerely 
despised 
rogues
and 
bad 
people, 
and 
with 
a 
tranquil 
conscience 
carried 
his 
head 
high.

Rakes, 
those 
male 
Magdalenes, 
have 
a 
secret 
feeling 
of 
innocence
similar 
to 
that 
which 
female 
Magdalenes 
have, 
based 
on 
the 
same 
hope 
of
forgiveness. 
"All 
will 
be 
forgiven 
her, 
for 
she 
loved 
much; 
and 
all
will 
be 
forgiven 
him, 
for 
he 
enjoyed 
much."

Dolokhov, 
who 
had 
reappeared 
that 
year 
in 
Moscow 
after 
his 
exile 
and
his 
Persian 
adventures, 
and 
was 
leading 
a 
life 
of 
luxury, 
gambling, 
and
dissipation, 
associated 
with 
his 
old 
Petersburg 
comrade 
Kuragin 
and
made 
use 
of 
him 
for 
his 
own 
ends.

Anatole 
was 
sincerely 
fond 
of 
Dolokhov 
for 
his 
cleverness 
and
audacity. 
Dolokhov, 
who 
needed 
Anatole 
Kuragin's 
name, 
position, 
and
connections 
as 
a 
bait 
to 
draw 
rich 
young 
men 
into 
his 
gambling 
set, 
made
use 
of 
him 
and 
amused 
himself 
at 
his 
expense 
without 
letting 
the 
other
feel 
it. 
Apart 
from 
the 
advantage 
he 
derived 
from 
Anatole, 
the 
very
process 
of 
dominating 
another's 
will 
was 
in 
itself 
a 
pleasure, 
a
habit, 
and 
a 
necessity 
to 
Dolokhov.

Natasha 
had 
made 
a 
strong 
impression 
on 
Kuragin.<p>
At 
supper 
after
the 
opera 
he 
described 
to 
Dolokhov 
with 
the 
air 
of 
a 
connoisseur 
the
attractions 
of 
her 
arms, 
shoulders, 
feet, 
and 
hair 
and 
expressed<p>
his
intention 
of 
making 
love 
to 
her. 
Anatole 
had 
no 
notion 
and 
was 
incapable
of 
considering 
what 
might 
come 
of 
such 
love-making, 
as 
he 
never 
had 
any
notion 
of 
the 
outcome 
of 
any 
of 
his 
actions.

"She's 
first-rate, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
but 
not 
for 
us," 
replied
Dolokhov.

"I 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hp2QJprO78hz.html">will</a> 
tell 
my 
sister 
to 
ask 
her 
to 
dinner," 
said 
Anatole.
"Eh?"

"You'd 
better 
wait 
till 
she's 
married...."

"You 
know, 
I 
adore 
little 
girls, 
they 
lose 
their 
heads 
at 
once,"
pursued 
Anatole.

"You 
have 
been 
caught 
once 
already 
by 
a 
'little 
girl,'" 
said
Dolokhov 
who 
knew 
of 
Kuragin's 
marriage. 
"Take 
care!"

"Well, 
that 
can't 
<a href="/cZl/LQ4Zd6C7FKLE.html">happen</a><p>
twice! 
Eh?" 
said 
Anatole, 
with 
a
good-humored 
laugh.





CHAPTER 
XII

The 
day 
after 
the 
opera 
the 
Rostovs 
went 
nowhere 
and 
nobody 
came 
to 
see
them. 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
talked 
to 
the<p>
count 
about 
something 
which 
they
concealed 
from 
Natasha.<p>
Natasha 
guessed 
they 
were 
talking 
about 
the
old 
prince 
and 
planning 
something, 
and 
this 
disquieted 
and 
offended 
her.
She 
was 
expecting 
Prince 
Andrew 
any 
moment 
and 
twice 
that 
day 
sent 
a
manservant 
to 
the 
Vozdvizhenka 
to 
ascertain 
whether 
he 
had 
come. 
He 
had
not 
arrived. 
She 
suffered 
more 
now 
than 
during 
her 
first 
days 
in 
Moscow.
To 
her 
impatience 
and 
pining
