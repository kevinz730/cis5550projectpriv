that 
I 
did 
not</h1>understand
her. 
How<p>
often 
when 
considering 
her 
character 
I 
have 
told 
myself 
that
I 
was 
to 
blame 
for 
not 
understanding 
her, 
for 
not 
understanding 
that
constant 
composure 
and 
complacency 
and 
lack 
of 
all 
interests 
or 
desires,
and 
the 
whole 
secret 
lies 
in 
the 
terrible 
truth 
that 
she 
is 
a 
depraved
woman. 
Now 
I 
have 
spoken 
that 
terrible 
word 
to 
myself 
all 
has 
<a href="/aVzUge/hW2bXmQ81KA.html">become
clear.

"Anatole</a> 
used 
to 
come 
to 
borrow 
money 
from 
her 
and 
used 
to 
kiss 
her
naked 
shoulders. 
She 
did 
not 
give 
him 
the 
money, 
but 
let 
herself 
be
kissed. 
Her 
father 
in 
jest 
tried 
to 
rouse 
her 
jealousy, 
and 
she 
replied
with 
a 
calm 
smile 
that 
she 
was 
not 
so 
stupid 
as 
to 
be 
jealous: 
'Let
him 
do 
what 
he 
pleases,' 
she 
used 
to 
say 
of 
me. 
One 
day 
I 
asked 
her 
if
she 
felt 
any 
symptoms 
of 
pregnancy. 
She 
laughed 
contemptuously 
and 
said
she 
was 
not 
a 
fool 
to 
want 
to 
have 
children, 
and 
that 
she 
was 
not 
going
to 
have 
any 
children 
by 
me."

Then 
he 
recalled 
the 
coarseness 
and 
bluntness 
of 
her 
thoughts 
and 
the
vulgarity 
of<p>
the 
expressions 
that 
were 
natural 
to 
her, 
though 
she 
had
been 
brought 
up 
in 
the 
most 
aristocratic 
circles.

"I'm 
not 
such 
a 
fool.... 
Just 
you 
try 
it 
on.... 
Allez-vous
promener," 
* 
she 
used 
to 
say. 
Often 
seeing 
the 
success 
she 
had 
with
young 
and 
old 
men 
and 
women 
Pierre 
could 
not 
understand 
why 
he 
did 
not
love 
her.

 
 
 
 
* 
"You 
clear 
out 
of 
this."


"Yes, 
I 
never 
loved 
her," 
said 
he 
to 
himself; 
"I 
knew 
she 
was 
a
depraved 
woman," 
he 
repeated, 
"but 
dared 
not 
admit 
it 
to 
myself.
And 
now 
there's 
Dolokhov 
sitting 
in 
the 
snow 
with 
a 
forced 
smile 
and
perhaps 
dying, 
while 
meeting 
my 
remorse 
with 
some 
forced 
bravado!"

Pierre 
was 
one 
of 
those 
people 
who, 
in 
spite 
of 
an 
appearance 
of 
what
is 
called 
weak 
character, 
do 
not 
seek 
a 
confidant 
in 
their 
troubles. 
He
digested 
his 
sufferings<p>
alone.

"It 
is 
all, 
all 
her 
fault," 
he 
said 
to 
himself; 
"but 
what 
of 
that?
Why 
did 
I 
bind 
myself 
to 
her? 
Why 
did 
I 
say 
'Je 
vous 
aime' 
* 
to 
her,
which 
was 
a 
lie, 
and 
worse 
than 
a 
lie? 
I 
am 
guilty 
and 
must 
endure...
what? 
A 
slur 
on 
my 
name? 
A 
misfortune 
for 
life? 
Oh, 
that's
nonsense," 
he 
thought. 
"The 
slur 
on 
my 
name 
and 
honor-that's 
all
apart 
from 
myself."

 
 
 
 
* 
I 
love 
you.

"Louis 
XVI 
was 
executed 
because 
they 
said 
he 
was 
dishonorable 
and 
a
criminal," 
came 
into 
Pierre's 
head, 
"and 
from 
their 
point 
of
view 
they 
were 
right, 
as 
were 
those 
too 
who 
canonized 
him 
and 
died 
a
martyr's 
death
