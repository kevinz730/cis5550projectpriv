CHAPTER 
V

The 
<a href="/cZl/ONG9qQqw3Mm6.html">rain</a> 
had 
stopped, 
and 
only 
the 
mist 
was 
falling 
and 
drops 
from
the 
trees. 
Denisov, 
the 
esaul, 
and 
Petya 
rode 
silently, 
following 
the
peasant 
in 
the 
knitted 
cap 
who, 
stepping 
lightly 
with 
outturned 
toes
and 
moving 
noiselessly 
in 
his 
bast 
shoes 
over 
the 
roots 
and 
wet 
leaves,
silently 
led 
<a href="/aVzUge/nI91hOZs9om.html">them</a> 
to 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
forest.

He 
ascended 
an 
incline, 
stopped, 
looked 
about 
him, 
and 
advanced 
to 
where
the 
screen 
of<p>
trees 
was 
less 
dense. 
On 
reaching 
a 
large 
oak 
tree 
that
had 
not 
yet 
shed 
its 
leaves, 
he 
stopped 
and 
beckoned 
mysteriously 
to
them 
with 
his 
hand.

Denisov 
and 
Petya 
rode 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ce16rq6TtfY.html">up</a> 
to 
him. 
From 
the 
spot 
where 
the 
peasant 
was
standing 
they 
could 
see 
the 
French. 
Immediately 
beyond 
the 
forest, 
on 
a
downward 
slope, 
lay 
a 
field 
of 
spring 
rye. 
To 
the 
right, 
beyond 
a 
steep
ravine, 
was 
a 
small 
village 
and 
a 
landowner's 
house 
with 
a 
broken 
roof.
In 
the 
village, 
in 
the 
house, 
in 
the 
garden, 
by 
the 
well, 
by 
the 
pond,
over 
all 
the 
rising 
ground, 
and 
all 
along 
the 
road 
uphill 
from 
the
bridge 
leading 
to 
the 
village, 
not 
more 
than 
five 
hundred 
yards
away, 
crowds 
of 
men 
could 
be 
seen 
through 
the 
shimmering 
mist.
