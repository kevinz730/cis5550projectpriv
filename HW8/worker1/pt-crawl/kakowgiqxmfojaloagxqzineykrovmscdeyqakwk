up
with 
his 
black 
horses 
over 
the 
winter 
rye 
to 
the 
place 
reserved 
for 
him,
where 
a 
wolf 
might 
come 
out. 
Having 
straightened 
his 
coat 
and 
fastened
on 
his 
hunting 
knives 
and 
horn, 
he 
mounted 
his 
good, 
sleek, 
well-fed,
and 
comfortable 
horse, 
Viflyanka, 
which 
was 
turning 
gray, 
like 
himself.
His 
horses 
and 
trap 
were 
sent 
home. 
Count 
Ilya 
Rostov, 
though 
not 
at
heart 
a 
keen 
sportsman, 
knew 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
hunt 
well, 
and 
rode 
to
the 
bushy 
edge 
of 
the 
road 
where 
he 
was 
to 
stand, 
arranged 
his 
reins,
settled 
himself 
in 
the 
saddle, 
and, 
feeling 
that 
he 
was 
ready, 
looked
about 
with 
a 
smile.

Beside 
him 
was 
Simon 
Chekmar, 
his 
personal 
attendant, 
an 
old 
horseman
now 
somewhat 
stiff 
in 
the 
saddle. 
Chekmar 
held 
in 
leash 
three
formidable 
wolfhounds, 
who 
had, 
however, 
grown 
fat 
like 
their 
master
and<p>
his 
horse. 
Two 
wise 
old 
dogs 
lay 
down 
unleashed. 
Some 
hundred 
paces
farther 
along 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
wood 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Md6W8CpNdk1.html">stood</a> 
Mitka, 
the 
count's 
other
groom, 
a 
daring 
horseman 
and 
keen 
rider 
to 
hounds. 
Before 
the 
hunt, 
by
old 
custom, 
the 
count 
had 
drunk 
a 
silver 
cupful 
of 
mulled 
brandy, 
taken
a 
snack, 
and 
washed 
it 
down 
with 
half 
a 
bottle 
of 
his 
favorite 
Bordeaux.

He 
was 
somewhat 
flushed 
with 
the 
wine 
and 
the 
drive. 
His 
eyes 
were
rather 
moist 
and 
glittered 
more 
than 
usual, 
and 
as 
he 
sat 
in 
his 
saddle,
wrapped 
up 
in 
his 
fur 
coat, 
he 
looked 
like 
a 
child 
taken 
out 
for 
an
outing.

The 
thin, 
hollow-cheeked 
Chekmar, 
having 
got 
everything 
ready, 
kept
glancing 
at 
his 
master 
with 
whom 
he 
had 
lived 
on 
the 
best 
of 
terms 
for
thirty 
years, 
and 
understanding 
the 
mood 
he 
was 
in 
expected 
a 
pleasant
chat. 
A 
third 
person 
rode 
up 
circumspectly 
through 
the 
wood 
(it 
was
plain 
that 
he 
had 
had 
a 
lesson) 
and 
stopped 
behind 
the 
count. 
This
person 
was 
a 
gray-bearded 
old 
man 
in 
a 
woman's 
cloak, 
with 
a 
tall
peaked 
<a href="/cZl/Xj19Ujvc9DLq.html">cap</a> 
on 
his 
head. 
He 
was 
the 
buffoon, 
who 
went 
by 
a 
woman's
name, 
Nastasya 
Ivanovna.

"Well, 
Nastasya 
Ivanovna!" 
whispered 
the 
count, 
winking 
at 
him.
"If 
you 
scare 
away 
the 
beast, 
Daniel'll 
give 
it 
you!"

"I 
know 
a 
thing 
or 
two 
myself!" 
said 
Nastasya 
Ivanovna.

"Hush!" 
whispered 
the 
count 
and 
turned 
to 
Simon. 
"Have 
you 
seen
the 
young 
countess?" 
he 
asked. 
"Where 
is 
she?"

"With 
young 
Count 
Peter, 
by 
the 
Zharov 
rank 
grass," 
answered 
Simon,
smiling. 
"Though 
she's 
a 
lady, 
she's 
very 
fond 
of 
hunting."

"And 
you're 
surprised 
at 
the 
way 
she 
rides, 
Simon, 
eh?" 
said
