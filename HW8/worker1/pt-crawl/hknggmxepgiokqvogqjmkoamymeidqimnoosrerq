repeated, 
accentuating 
the</h1>u: 
"I 
think, 
however, 
now 
that 
he 
lays
down 
laws 
for 
Austria 
at 
Schoenbrunn, 
il 
faut

* 
I 
shall 
certainly 
adopt 
an 
innovation 
and 
call 
him 
simply
Bonaparte!"

 
 
 
 
* 
"We 
must 
let 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vu6WlHf7HBo5cU.html">him</a> 
off 
the

"But 
joking 
apart," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"do 
you<p>
really 
<a href="/cZl/Sj6GBzwy2Kc2NiMWg.html">think</a> 
the
campaign 
is<p>
over?"

"This 
is 
what 
I 
think. 
Austria 
has 
been 
made 
a 
fool 
of, 
and 
she 
is
not 
used 
to 
it. 
She 
will 
retaliate. 
And 
she 
has 
been 
fooled 
in 
the
first<p>
place 
because 
her 
provinces 
<a href="/aVzUge/If4vGX4Cr8.html">have</a> 
been 
pillaged-they 
say 
the 
Holy
Russian 
army 
loots 
terribly-her 
army 
is 
destroyed, 
her 
capital
taken, 
and 
all 
this 
for 
the 
beaux 
yeux 
* 
of 
His 
Sardinian 
Majesty. 
And
therefore-this 
is 
between 
ourselves-I 
instinctively 
feel 
that 
we
are 
being 
deceived, 
my 
instinct 
tells 
me 
of 
negotiations 
with 
France 
and
projects 
for 
peace, 
a 
secret 
peace 
concluded 
separately."

Fine 
eyes.

"Impossible!" 
cried 
Prince 
Andrew. 
"That 
would 
be 
too 
base."

"If 
we 
live 
we 
shall 
see," 
replied 
Bilibin, 
his 
face 
again 
becoming
smooth 
as 
a 
sign 
that 
the 
conversation 
was 
at 
an 
end.

When 
Prince 
Andrew 
reached 
the 
room 
prepared 
for 
him 
and 
lay 
down 
in 
a
clean 
shirt 
on 
the 
feather 
bed 
with 
its 
warmed 
and 
fragrant 
pillows, 
he
felt 
that 
the 
battle 
of 
which 
he 
had 
brought 
tidings 
was 
far, 
far
away 
from 
him. 
The 
alliance 
with 
Prussia, 
Austria's 
treachery,
Bonaparte's 
new 
triumph, 
tomorrow's 
levee 
and 
parade, 
and 
the
audience 
with 
the 
Emperor<p>
Francis 
occupied 
his 
thoughts.

He 
closed 
his 
eyes, 
and 
immediately 
a 
sound 
of 
cannonading, 
of 
musketry
and 
the 
rattling 
of 
carriage 
wheels 
seemed 
to 
fill 
his 
ears, 
and 
now
again 
drawn 
out 
in 
a 
thin<p>
line 
the 
musketeers 
were 
descending 
the 
hill,
the 
French 
were 
firing, 
and 
he 
felt 
his 
heart 
palpitating 
as 
he 
rode
forward 
beside 
Schmidt 
with 
the 
bullets 
merrily 
whistling 
all 
around,
and 
he 
experienced 
tenfold 
the 
joy 
of 
living, 
as 
he 
had 
not 
done 
since
childhood.

He 
woke 
up...

"Yes, 
that 
all 
happened!" 
he 
said, 
and, 
smiling 
happily 
to 
himself
like 
a 
child, 
he 
fell 
into 
a 
deep, 
youthful 
slumber.





CHAPTER 
XI

Next 
day 
he 
woke 
late. 
Recalling 
his 
recent 
impressions, 
the 
first
thought 
that 
came 
into 
his 
mind 
was 
that 
today 
he 
had 
to 
be 
presented
to 
the 
Emperor 
Francis; 
he 
remembered 
the 
Minister 
of 
War, 
the 
polite
Austrian 
adjutant, 
Bilibin, 
and 
last 
night's 
conversation. 
Having
dressed 
for 
his 
attendance 
at 
court 
in 
full 
parade 
uniform, 
which 
he
had 
not 
worn 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
he 
went 
into 
Bilibin's 
study 
fresh,
animated, 
and 
handsome, 
with 
his 
hand 
bandaged. 
In 
the 
study 
were 
four
gentlemen 
of 
the 
diplomatic 
corps. 
With 
Prince 
Hippolyte 
Kuragin,
who 
was 
a 
secretary 
to 
the 
embassy, 
Bolkonski 
was 
already 
acquainted.
Bilibin 
introduced 
him 
to 
the 
others.

The 
gentlemen 
assembled 
at 
Bilibin's 
were 
young, 
wealthy, 
gay 
society
men, 
who 
here, 
as 
in 
Vienna, 
formed 
a 
special 
set 
which 
Bilibin, 
their
leader, 
called 
les 
notres. 
* 
This 
set, 
consisting 
almost 
exclusively 
of
diplomats, 
evidently 
had 
its 
own 
interests<p>
which 
had 
nothing<p>
to 
do 
with
war 
or 
politics 
but 
related 
to 
high 
society, 
to 
certain 
women, 
and 
to
the 
official 
side 
of 
the 
service. 
These 
gentlemen 
received 
Prince
Andrew 
as 
one 
of 
themselves, 
an 
honor 
they 
did 
not 
extend 
to 
many. 
From
politeness 
and 
to 
start<p>
conversation, 
they 
asked 
him 
a 
few 
questions
about 
the 
army 
and 
the 
battle, 
and 
then 
the 
talk 
went 
off 
into 
merry
jests 
and 
gossip.

Ours.

"But 
the 
best 
of 
it 
was," 
said 
one, 
telling 
of 
the 
misfortune 
of
a 
fellow 
diplomat, 
"that 
the 
Chancellor 
told 
him 
flatly 
that 
his
appointment 
to 
London 
was 
a 
promotion 
and 
that 
he 
was 
so 
to 
regard 
it.
Can 
you 
fancy 
the<p>
figure 
he 
cut?..."

"But 
the 
worst 
of 
it, 
gentlemen-I 
am 
giving 
Kuragin 
away 
to
you-is 
that 
that 
man 
suffers, 
and 
this 
Don 
Juan, 
wicked 
fellow, 
is
taking 
advantage 
of<p>
it!"

Prince 
Hippolyte
