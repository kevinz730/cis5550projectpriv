priceless</h1>are 
those 
last 
moments! 
It 
can 
make 
things 
no
worse, 
and 
it 
is 
absolutely 
necessary 
to 
prepare 
him 
if 
he 
is 
so 
ill.
We 
women, 
Prince," 
and 
she 
smiled 
tenderly, 
"always 
know 
how 
to 
say
these 
things. 
I 
absolutely 
must 
see 
him, 
however<p>
painful 
it 
may 
be 
for
me. 
I 
am 
used 
to 
suffering."

Evidently 
the 
prince 
understood 
her, 
and 
also 
understood, 
as 
he 
had 
done
at 
Anna 
Pavlovna's, 
that 
it 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
Anna
Mikhaylovna.

"Would 
not 
such 
a 
meeting 
be 
too 
trying 
for 
him, 
dear 
Anna
Mikhaylovna?" 
said 
he. 
"Let 
us 
wait 
until 
evening. 
The 
doctors 
are
expecting 
a 
crisis."

"But 
one 
cannot 
delay, 
Prince, 
at 
such 
a 
moment!<p>
Consider 
<a href="/cZl/HQ2YmejJ4e1au.html">that</a> 
the
welfare 
of 
his 
soul 
is 
at 
stake. 
Ah, 
it 
is 
awful: 
the 
duties 
of 
a
Christian..."

A 
door 
of 
one 
of 
the 
inner 
rooms 
opened 
and 
one 
of 
the 
princesses, 
the
count's 
niece, 
entered 
with 
a 
cold, 
stern 
face. 
The 
length 
of 
her
body 
was 
strikingly 
out 
of 
proportion 
to 
her 
short 
legs. 
Prince 
Vasili
turned 
to 
her.

"Well, 
how 
is 
he?"

"Still 
the 
same; 
but 
what 
can 
you 
expect, 
this 
noise..." 
said 
the
princess, 
looking 
at 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
as 
at 
a 
stranger.

"Ah, 
my 
dear, 
I 
hardly 
knew 
you," 
said 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
with 
a
happy 
smile, 
ambling 
lightly 
up 
to 
the 
count's 
niece. 
"I 
have 
come,
and 
am 
at 
your 
service 
to 
help 
you 
nurse 
my 
uncle. 
I 
imagine 
what 
you
have 
gone 
through," 
and 
she 
sympathetically 
turned 
up 
her 
eyes.

princess
