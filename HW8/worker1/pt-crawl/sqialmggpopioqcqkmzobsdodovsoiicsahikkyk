He 
understood 
that 
for 
him 
the 
storm 
had 
blown 
over, 
and 
that 
Kutuzov
would 
content 
himself<p>
with 
that 
hint.

"He's 
having 
a 
little 
fun 
at 
my 
expense," 
said 
Ermolov 
softly, 
nudging
with 
his 
knee 
Raevski 
who 
was 
at 
his 
side.

Soon 
after 
this, 
Ermolov 
moved 
up 
to 
Kutuzov 
and 
respectfully 
remarked:

"It 
is 
not 
too 
late 
yet, 
your 
Highness-the 
enemy 
has 
not 
gone 
away-if
you 
were 
to 
order 
an 
attack! 
If 
not, 
the 
Guards 
will 
not 
so 
much 
as 
see
a 
little 
smoke."

Kutuzov 
did 
not 
reply, 
but 
when 
they 
reported 
to 
him 
that 
Murat's 
troops
were 
in 
retreat 
he 
ordered 
an 
advance, 
though 
at 
every 
hundred 
paces 
he
halted 
for 
three 
quarters 
of 
an 
hour.

The 
whole 
battle 
consisted 
in 
what 
Orlov-Denisov's 
Cossacks 
had 
done:
the 
rest 
of 
the 
army 
merely 
lost 
some 
hundreds 
of 
men 
uselessly.

In 
consequence 
of 
this 
battle 
Kutuzov 
received 
a 
diamond 
decoration,
and 
Bennigsen 
some 
diamonds 
and 
a 
hundred 
thousand 
rubles, 
others 
also
received 
pleasant 
recognitions 
corresponding 
to 
their 
various 
grades,
and 
following 
the 
battle 
fresh 
changes 
were 
made 
in 
the 
staff.

"That's 
how 
everything 
is 
done 
with 
us, 
all 
topsy-turvy!" 
said 
the
Russian 
officers<p>
and 
generals 
after 
the 
Tarutino 
battle, 
letting 
it 
be
understood 
that 
some 
fool 
there 
is 
doing 
things 
all 
wrong 
but 
that
we 
ourselves 
should 
not 
have 
done 
so, 
just 
as 
people 
speak 
today. 
But
people 
who 
talk 
like 
that 
either 
do 
not 
know 
what 
they 
are 
talking 
about
or 
deliberately 
deceive 
themselves. 
No 
battle-Tarutino, 
Borodino, 
or
Austerlitz-takes 
place 
as 
those 
who 
planned 
it 
anticipated. 
That 
is 
an
essential 
condition.

A 
countless 
number 
of 
free 
forces 
(for 
nowhere 
is 
man 
freer 
than 
during
a 
battle, 
where 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
life 
and 
death) 
influence 
the 
course
taken 
by 
the 
fight, 
and 
that 
course 
never 
can 
be 
known 
in 
advance 
and
never 
coincides 
with 
the 
direction 
of 
any 
one 
force.

If 
many 
simultaneously 
and 
variously 
directed 
forces 
act 
on 
a 
given
body, 
the<p>
direction 
of 
its 
motion 
cannot 
coincide 
with 
any 
one 
of 
those
forces, 
but 
will 
always 
be 
a 
mean-what 
in 
mechanics 
is 
represented 
by
the 
diagonal 
of 
a 
parallelogram 
of 
forces.

If 
in 
the 
descriptions 
given 
by 
historians, 
especially 
French 
ones, 
we
find 
their 
wars 
and 
battles 
carried 
out 
in 
accordance 
with 
previously
formed 
plans, 
the 
only 
conclusion 
to 
be 
drawn 
is 
that 
those 
descriptions
are 
false.

The 
battle 
of 
Tarutino 
obviously 
did 
not 
attain 
the 
aim 
Toll 
had 
in
view-to 
lead 
the 
troops 
into 
action 
in 
the 
order 
prescribed 
by 
the
dispositions; 
nor 
that 
which 
Count 
Orlov-Denisov 
may 
have 
had 
in 
view-to
take 
Murat 
prisoner; 
nor 
the 
result 
of 
immediately 
destroying 
the 
whole
corps, 
which 
Bennigsen 
and 
others 
may 
have 
had 
in 
view; 
nor 
the 
aim 
of
the 
officer 
who 
wished 
to 
go
