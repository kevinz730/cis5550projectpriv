CHAPTER 
VI

The 
duel 
between 
Pierre 
and 
Dolokhov 
was 
hushed 
up 
and, 
in 
spite 
of
the 
Emperor's 
severity 
regarding 
duels 
at 
that 
time, 
neither 
the
principals 
nor 
their 
seconds 
suffered 
for 
it.<p>
But 
the 
story 
of 
the 
duel,
confirmed 
by<p>
Pierre's 
rupture 
with 
his 
wife, 
was 
the 
talk 
of<p>
society.
Pierre 
who 
had 
been 
regarded 
with 
patronizing 
condescension 
when 
he 
was
an 
illegitimate 
son, 
and 
petted 
and 
extolled 
when 
he 
was 
the 
best
match 
in 
Russia, 
had 
sunk 
greatly 
in 
the 
esteem 
of 
society 
after 
his
marriage-when 
the 
marriageable 
daughters 
and 
their 
mothers 
had 
nothing
to 
hope 
from 
him-especially 
as 
he 
did 
not 
know 
how, 
and 
did 
not
wish, 
to 
court 
society's 
favor. 
Now 
he 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Fcn8HQTp6BPULq5fOHvf.html">alone</a> 
was 
blamed 
for 
what 
had
happened, 
he 
was 
said 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Li3a6l4X.html">be</a> 
insanely 
jealous 
and 
subject 
like 
his
father 
to 
fits 
of 
bloodthirsty 
rage. 
And 
when<p>
after 
Pierre's
departure 
Helene 
returned 
to 
Petersburg, 
she 
was 
received 
by 
all 
her
acquaintances 
not 
only 
cordially, 
but 
even 
with 
a 
shade 
of 
deference
due 
to 
her 
misfortune. 
When 
conversation 
turned 
on 
her 
husband 
Helene
assumed 
a 
dignified 
expression, 
which 
with 
characteristic 
tact 
she 
had
acquired 
though 
she 
did 
not 
understand 
its 
significance. 
This 
expression
suggested 
that 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/njR9fLYk6NSUp5Url.html">she</a> 
had 
resolved 
to 
endure 
her 
troubles 
uncomplainingly
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/wd8YyaBP8mTUVM0.html">that</a> 
her 
husband 
was 
a 
cross 
laid 
upon 
her 
by 
God. 
Prince 
Vasili
expressed 
his 
opinion 
more 
openly. 
He 
shrugged 
his 
shoulders 
when 
Pierre
was 
mentioned 
and, 
pointing 
to 
his 
forehead, 
remarked:

"A 
bit 
touched-I 
always 
said 
so."

"I 
said 
from 
the 
first," 
declared 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
referring 
to
Pierre, 
"I 
said 
at 
the 
time 
and 
before 
anyone 
else" 
(she 
insisted
on 
her 
priority) 
"that 
that 
senseless 
young 
man 
was 
spoiled 
by 
the
depraved 
ideas 
of 
these 
days. 
I 
said 
so 
even 
at 
the 
time 
when 
everybody
was 
in 
raptures 
about 
him, 
when 
he 
had 
just 
returned 
from 
abroad, 
and
when, 
if 
you 
remember, 
he 
posed 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
Marat 
at 
one 
of 
my 
soirees.
And 
how 
has 
it 
ended? 
I 
was 
against 
this 
marriage 
even 
then 
and 
foretold
all 
that 
has 
happened."
