The

for

<a href="/cZl/En6JdRQ3w5vWPe.html">by</a> 
him 
alone. 
Nominally 
he 
is 
only 
an
adjutant 
on 
Kutuzov's 
staff, 
but 
he 
does 
everything 
alone. 
The

is 
won

Kutuzov

"Well 
and 
then?" 
asked 
the 
other 
voice. 
"If 
before 
that 
you 
are
not 
ten 
times 
wounded, 
killed, 
or 
betrayed, 
well... 
what 
then?..."
"Well 
then," 
Prince 
Andrew 
answered 
himself, 
"I 
don't 
know
what 
will 
happen 
and 
don't 
want 
to 
know, 
and 
can't, 
but 
if 
I 
want
this-want 
glory, 
want 
to 
be 
known 
to 
men, 
want<p>
to 
be 
loved 
by 
them, 
it
is 
not 
my 
fault 
that 
I 
want 
it 
and 
want 
nothing 
but 
that 
and 
live 
only
for 
that. 
Yes, 
for 
that 
alone! 
I 
shall 
never 
tell 
anyone, 
but, 
oh 
God!
what 
am 
I 
to 
do 
if 
I 
love 
nothing 
but<p>
fame<p>
and 
men's 
esteem? 
Death,
wounds, 
the 
loss 
of 
family-I 
fear 
nothing. 
And 
precious 
and 
dear
as 
many 
persons 
are 
to 
me-father, 
sister, 
wife-those 
dearest 
to
me-yet 
dreadful 
and 
unnatural 
as 
it 
seems, 
I 
would 
give 
them 
all 
at
once 
for 
a 
moment 
of 
glory, 
of 
triumph 
over 
men, 
of 
love 
from 
men 
I
don't 
know 
and 
never 
shall 
know, 
for 
the 
love 
of 
these 
men 
here," 
he
thought, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/GI2tvrb1IW8ClqSz.html">as</a> 
he 
listened 
to 
voices 
in 
Kutuzov's 
courtyard. 
The 
voices
were 
those 
of 
the 
orderlies 
who 
were 
packing 
up; 
one 
voice, 
probably 
a
coachman's, 
was 
teasing 
Kutuzov's 
old 
cook 
whom 
Prince 
Andrew 
knew,
and 
who 
was 
called 
Tit. 
He
