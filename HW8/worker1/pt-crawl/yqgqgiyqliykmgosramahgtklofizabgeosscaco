another 
group 
of</h1>horsemen 
galloped 
up 
to 
the 
opposite 
flank, 
and
at 
the 
head 
of 
them 
Rostov 
recognized 
Napoleon. 
It 
could 
be 
no<p>
one
else. 
He 
came 
at 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/mbm6iCtOt1bvO1.html">gallop,</a> 
wearing 
a 
small 
hat, 
a 
blue 
uniform 
open 
over
a 
white 
vest, 
and 
the 
St. 
Andrew 
ribbon 
over 
his 
shoulder. 
He 
was 
riding
a 
very 
fine 
thoroughbred<p>
gray 
Arab 
horse 
with 
a 
crimson 
gold-embroidered
saddlecloth. 
On 
approaching 
Alexander 
he 
raised 
his 
hat, 
and 
as 
he 
did
so, 
Rostov, 
with 
his 
cavalryman's 
eye, 
could 
not 
help 
noticing
that 
Napoleon 
did 
not 
sit 
well 
or 
firmly 
in 
the 
saddle. 
The 
battalions
shouted 
"Hurrah!" 
and 
"Vive 
l'Empereur!" 
Napoleon 
said
something 
to 
Alexander, 
and 
both 
Emperors 
dismounted 
and 
took 
each
other's 
hands. 
Napoleon's 
face 
wore 
an 
unpleasant 
and 
artificial
smile. 
Alexander 
was 
saying 
something 
affable 
to 
him.

In 
spite 
of 
the 
trampling 
of 
the 
French 
gendarmes' 
horses, 
which
were 
pushing 
back 
the 
crowd, 
Rostov 
kept 
his 
eyes 
on 
every 
movement
of 
Alexander 
and 
Bonaparte. 
It 
struck 
him 
as 
a 
surprise 
that 
Alexander
treated 
Bonaparte 
as 
an 
equal 
and 
that 
the 
latter 
was 
quite 
at 
ease 
with
the 
Tsar, 
as 
if 
such 
relations 
with 
an 
Emperor 
were 
an 
everyday 
matter
to 
him.

Alexander 
and 
Napoleon, 
with 
the 
long 
train 
of 
their 
suites, 
approached
the 
right 
flank 
of 
the 
Preobrazhensk 
battalion 
and 
came 
straight 
up 
to
the 
crowd 
standing 
there. 
The 
crowd 
unexpectedly 
found 
itself 
so 
close
to 
the 
Emperors 
that 
Rostov, 
standing 
in 
the 
front<p>
row, 
was 
afraid 
he
might 
be 
recognized.

"Sire, 
I 
ask 
your 
permission 
to 
present 
the 
Legion 
of 
Honor 
to 
the
bravest 
of 
your 
soldiers," 
said 
a 
sharp, 
precise 
voice, 
articulating
every 
letter.

This 
was 
said 
by 
the 
undersized 
Napoleon, 
looking 
up 
straight 
into
Alexander's 
eyes. 
Alexander 
listened 
attentively 
to 
what 
was 
said 
to
him 
and, 
bending 
his 
head, 
smiled 
pleasantly.

"To 
him 
who 
has 
borne 
himself 
most 
bravely 
in 
this 
last 
war," 
added
Napoleon, 
accentuating 
each 
syllable, 
as 
with 
a 
composure 
and 
assurance
exasperating 
to 
Rostov, 
he 
ran 
his 
eyes 
over 
the 
Russian 
ranks 
drawn
up 
before 
him, 
who 
all 
presented 
arms 
with 
their 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
their
Emperor.

"Will 
Your 
Majesty 
allow 
me 
to 
consult 
the 
colonel?" 
said 
Alexander
and 
took 
a 
few 
hasty 
steps 
toward 
Prince 
Kozlovski, 
the 
commander 
of
the 
battalion.

Bonaparte 
meanwhile 
began 
taking 
the 
glove 
off 
his 
small 
white 
hand,
tore 
it 
in 
doing 
so, 
and 
threw 
it 
away. 
An 
aide-de-camp 
behind 
him
rushed 
forward 
and 
picked 
it 
up.

"To 
whom 
shall 
it 
be 
given?" 
the 
Emperor 
Alexander 
asked 
Kozlovski,
in 
Russian 
in 
a 
low 
voice.

"To 
whomever 
Your 
Majesty 
commands."

The 
Emperor 
knit 
his 
brows 
with 
dissatisfaction 
and, 
glancing 
back,
remarked:

"But 
we 
must 
give 
him 
an 
answer."

Kozlovski 
scanned 
the 
ranks 
resolutely 
and 
included 
Rostov 
in 
his
scrutiny.

"Can 
it 
be 
me?" 
thought 
Rostov.

"Lazarev!" 
the 
colonel 
called, 
with 
a 
frown, 
and 
Lazarev, 
the
first 
soldier 
in<p>
the 
rank, 
stepped 
briskly 
forward.

"Where 
are 
you 
off 
to? 
Stop 
here!" 
voices 
whispered 
to 
Lazarev 
who
did 
not 
know 
where 
to<p>
go. 
Lazarev 
stopped, 
casting 
a 
sidelong 
look 
at
his 
colonel 
in 
alarm. 
His 
face 
twitched, 
as 
often 
happens 
to 
soldiers
called 
before 
the 
ranks.

Napoleon 
slightly 
turned 
his 
head, 
and 
put 
his 
plump 
little 
hand 
out
behind 
him 
as 
if 
to 
take 
something. 
The 
members 
of 
his 
suite, 
guessing
at 
once 
what 
he 
wanted, 
moved 
about 
and 
whispered 
as 
they 
passed
something 
from 
one 
<a href="/aVzUge/QI3wNlRn5ahj2jJ.html">to</a> 
another, 
and 
a 
page-the 
same 
one 
Rostov
had 
seen 
the 
previous 
evening 
at 
Boris'-ran

and, 
bowing
respectfully 
over 
the 
outstretched 
hand 
and
