long 
before, 
but 
that 
nine 
tenths 
of 
the 
peasants 
in 
that
villages 
were 
in 
a 
state 
of 
the 
greatest 
poverty. 
He 
did 
not 
know 
that
since 
the 
nursing 
mothers 
were 
no 
longer 
sent 
to 
work 
on 
his 
land, 
they
did 
still 
harder 
work 
on 
their 
own 
land. 
He 
did 
not 
know 
that 
the 
priest
who 
met 
him 
with 
the 
cross 
oppressed 
the 
peasants 
by 
his 
exactions, 
and
that 
the 
pupils' 
parents 
wept 
at 
having 
to 
let 
him 
take 
their 
children
and 
secured 
their 
release 
by 
heavy 
payments. 
He 
did<p>
not 
know 
that 
the
brick 
buildings, 
built 
to 
plan, 
were 
being 
built 
by 
serfs 
whose 
manorial
labor 
was 
thus 
increased, 
though 
lessened 
on 
paper. 
He 
did 
not 
know
that 
where 
the 
steward 
had 
shown 
him 
in 
the 
accounts 
that 
the 
serfs'
payments 
had 
been 
diminished 
by 
a 
third, 
their 
obligatory 
manorial 
work
had 
been 
increased 
by 
a 
half. 
And 
so 
Pierre 
was 
delighted 
with 
his 
visit
to 
his 
estates 
and 
quite 
recovered 
the 
philanthropic 
mood 
in 
which
he 
had 
left<p>
Petersburg, 
and 
wrote 
enthusiastic 
letters 
to 
his
"brother-instructor" 
as 
he 
called 
the 
Grand 
Master.

"How 
easy 
it 
is, 
how 
little 
effort 
it 
needs, 
to 
do 
so 
much 
good,"
thought 
Pierre, 
"and 
how 
little 
attention 
we 
pay 
to 
it!"

He 
was 
pleased 
at 
the 
gratitude 
he 
received, 
but 
felt 
abashed 
at
receiving 
it. 
This 
gratitude 
reminded 
him 
of 
how 
much 
more 
he 
might 
do
for 
these 
simple, 
kindly 
people.

The 
chief 
steward, 
a 
very 
stupid 
but 
cunning 
man 
who 
saw 
perfectly
through 
the 
naive 
and 
intelligent 
count 
and 
played 
with 
him 
as 
with
a 
toy, 
seeing 
the 
effect 
these 
prearranged 
receptions 
had 
on 
Pierre,
pressed 
him 
still 
harder 
with 
proofs 
of 
the 
impossibility 
and 
above 
all
the 
uselessness 
of 
freeing 
the 
serfs, 
who 
were 
quite 
happy 
as 
it 
was.

Pierre 
in 
his 
secret 
soul 
agreed 
with 
the 
steward 
that 
it 
would 
be
difficult 
to 
imagine 
happier 
people, 
and 
that<p>
God 
only 
knew 
what 
would
happen 
to 
them 
when 
they 
were 
free, 
but 
he 
insisted, 
though 
reluctantly,
on 
what 
he 
thought 
right. 
The 
steward 
promised 
to 
do 
<a href="/cZl/pS5pWxqu6ct6cV.html">all</a> 
in 
his 
power 
to
carry 
out 
the 
count's 
wishes, 
seeing 
clearly 
that 
not 
only 
would 
the
count 
never 
be 
able 
to 
find 
out 
whether 
all 
measures 
had 
been 
taken 
for
the 
sale 
of 
the 
land 
and 
forests 
and 
to 
release 
them 
from 
the 
Land 
Bank,
but 
would 
probably 
never 
even 
inquire<p>
and 
would 
never 
know 
that 
the
newly 
erected 
buildings 
were 
standing 
empty 
and 
that 
the 
serfs 
continued
to 
give 
in 
money 
and 
work 
all 
that 
other 
people's 
serfs 
gave-that<p>
is
to 
say, 
all 
that 
could 
be 
got 
out 
of 
them.





CHAPTER 
XI

Returning 
from 
his 
journey 
through 
South 
Russia 
in 
the 
happiest 
state
of 
mind, 
Pierre 
carried 
out 
an 
intention 
he 
had 
long 
had 
of 
visiting 
his
friend 
Bolkonski, 
whom 
he 
had 
not 
seen 
for 
two 
years.

Bogucharovo 
lay 
in 
a 
flat 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xy5zJMx9GaVr5ddue.html">uninteresting</a> 
part 
of 
the 
country 
among
fields 
and 
forests 
of 
fir 
and 
birch, 
which 
were 
partly 
cut 
down. 
The
house 
<a href="/aVzUge/mo93yxsz3GBhrH.html">lay</a> 
behind 
a 
newly 
dug 
pond 
filled 
with 
water 
to 
the 
brink 
and
with 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/YO9fw0CBzhL7.html">banks</a> 
still 
bare 
of 
grass. 
It 
was

of
