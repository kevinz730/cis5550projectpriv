brought 
him 
in 
contact 
with, 
particularly 
with 
man-not 
any 
particular
man, 
but 
those 
with 
whom 
he 
happened 
to 
be. 
He 
loved 
his 
dog, 
his
comrades, 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/LE260zSr.html">French,</a> 
and 
Pierre 
who 
was 
his 
neighbor,<p>
but 
Pierre 
felt
that 
in 
spite 
of 
Karataev's 
affectionate 
tenderness 
for 
him 
(by 
which
he 
unconsciously 
gave 
Pierre's 
spiritual 
life 
its 
due) 
he 
would 
not 
have
grieved 
for 
a 
moment 
at 
parting 
from 
him. 
And 
Pierre 
began 
to 
feel 
in
the 
same 
way 
toward 
Karataev.

To 
all 
the 
other 
prisoners 
Platon 
Karataev 
seemed 
a 
most 
ordinary
soldier. 
They 
called<p>
him 
"little 
falcon" 
or 
"Platosha," 
chaffed 
him
good-naturedly, 
and 
sent 
him 
on 
errands. 
But 
to 
Pierre 
he 
always
remained 
what 
he 
had 
seemed 
that 
first 
night: 
an 
unfathomable,<p>
rounded,
eternal 
personification 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
simplicity 
and 
truth.

Platon 
Karataev 
knew 
nothing 
by 
heart 
except 
his 
prayers. 
When 
he 
began
to 
speak 
he 
seemed 
not 
to 
know 
how 
he 
would 
conclude.

Sometimes 
Pierre, 
struck 
by 
the 
meaning 
of 
his 
words, 
would 
ask 
him 
to
repeat 
them, 
but 
Platon 
could 
never 
recall 
what 
he 
had 
said 
a 
moment
before, 
just 
as 
he 
never 
could 
repeat 
to 
Pierre 
the 
words 
of 
his
favorite 
song: 
native 
and 
birch 
tree 
and 
my 
heart 
is 
sick 
occurred 
in
it, 
but 
when 
spoken 
and 
not 
sung, 
no 
meaning 
could 
be 
got 
out 
of 
it. 
He
did 
not, 
and 
could 
not, 
understand 
the 
meaning 
of 
words 
apart 
from
their 
context. 
Every 
word 
and 
action 
of 
his 
was 
the 
manifestation 
of
an 
activity 
unknown 
to 
him, 
which 
was 
his 
life. 
But 
his 
life, 
as 
he
regarded<p>
it,<p>
had 
no 
meaning 
as 
a 
separate 
thing. 
It 
had 
meaning 
only 
as
part 
of 
a 
whole 
of 
which 
he 
was 
always 
conscious. 
<a href="/aVzUge/mbm2HwD3a7Cv.html">His</a> 
words 
and 
actions
flowed 
from 
him 
as 
evenly, 
inevitably, 
and 
spontaneously 
as 
fragrance
exhales 
from 
a 
flower. 
He 
could 
not 
understand 
the 
value 
or 
significance
of 
any 
word 
or 
deed 
taken 
separately.





CHAPTER 
XIV

When 
Princess 
Mary 
heard 
from 
<a href="/cZl/Cv8A9oSU7PBy.html">Nicholas</a> 
that 
her 
brother 
was 
with 
the
Rostovs 
at 
Yaroslavl 
she 
at 
once 
prepared 
to 
go 
there, 
in 
spite 
of 
her
aunt's 
efforts 
to 
dissuade 
her-and 
not 
merely 
to 
go 
herself 
but 
to 
take
her 
nephew 
with 
her. 
Whether 
it 
were 
difficult 
or 
easy, 
possible 
or
impossible, 
she 
did 
not 
ask 
and 
did 
not 
want 
to 
know: 
it 
was 
her 
duty,
not 
only 
to 
herself, 
to 
be 
near 
her 
brother 
who 
was 
perhaps 
dying, 
but
to 
do 
everything 
possible 
to 
take 
his 
son 
to 
him, 
and 
so 
she 
prepared
to 
set 
off. 
That 
she 
had 
not 
heard 
from 
Prince 
Andrew 
himself, 
Princess
Mary 
attributed 
to 
his 
being 
too 
weak 
to 
write 
or<p>
to 
his 
considering 
the
long 
journey 
too 
hard 
and 
too 
dangerous 
for 
her 
and 
his 
son.

In 
a 
few 
days 
Princess 
Mary 
was 
ready 
to 
start. 
Her 
equipages 
were 
the
huge 
family 
coach 
in 
which 
she 
had 
traveled 
to 
Voronezh, 
a 
semiopen
trap, 
and 
a 
baggage 
cart. 
With 
her 
traveled 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne,
little 
Nicholas 
and 
his 
tutor, 
her 
old 
nurse, 
three 
maids, 
Tikhon, 
and 
a
young 
footman 
and 
courier 
her 
aunt 
had<p>
sent 
to 
accompany 
her.

The 
usual 
route 
through 
Moscow 
could 
not 
be 
thought 
of, 
and 
<a href="/cZl/DU5e23A.html">the
roundabout</a> 
way 
Princess 
Mary 
was 
obliged 
to 
take 
through 
Lipetsk,
Ryazan, 
Vladimir, 
and 
Shuya 
was 
very 
long 
and, 
as 
post 
horses 
were 
not
everywhere 
obtainable, 
very 
difficult, 
and 
near 
Ryazan 
where 
the 
French
were 
said 
to 
have 
shown 
themselves 
was 
even 
dangerous.

During 
this 
difficult 
journey 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
Dessalles, 
and
Princess 
Mary's 
servants 
were 
astonished 
at 
her 
energy 
and 
firmness 
of
spirit. 
She 
went 
to 
bed 
later 
and 
rose 
earlier 
than 
any 
of 
them, 
and
no 
difficulties 
daunted 
her.
