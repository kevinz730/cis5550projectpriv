something."

Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
shook 
her 
head.

"You 
are 
a 
little 
slyboots," 
she 
said.

"A 
letter 
from 
Nikolenka! 
I'm 
sure 
of 
it!" 
exclaimed 
Natasha,
reading 
confirmation 
in 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna's 
face.

"But 
for 
God's 
sake, 
be 
careful, 
you 
know 
how 
it 
may 
affect 
your
mamma."

"I 
will, 
I 
will, 
only 
tell 
me! 
You 
won't? 
Then 
I 
will 
go 
and 
tell 
at
once."

Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
in 
a 
few 
words, 
told 
her 
the 
contents 
of 
the 
letter,
on 
condition 
that 
she 
should 
tell 
no 
one.

"No, 
<a href="/aVzUge/UhX5o5tTZW.html">on</a> 
my 
true 
word 
of 
honor," 
said 
Natasha, 
crossing 
herself,
"I 
won't 
tell 
anyone!" 
and 
she 
ran 
off 
at 
once 
to 
Sonya.

"Nikolenka... 
wounded... 
a 
letter," 
she 
announced 
in 
gleeful
triumph.

"Nicholas!" 
was 
all 
Sonya 
said, 
instantly 
turning 
white.

Natasha, 
seeing 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/ZS6fqZYy9oGGl7suxK.html">impression</a> 
the 
news 
of 
her 
brother's 
wound
produced 
<a href="/cZl/vM1Nz27fvg.html">on</a> 
Sonya, 
felt 
for 
the 
first 
time 
the 
sorrowful 
side 
of 
the
news.

She 
<a href="/aVzUge/Amp68GdRBS9WMYlo.html">rushed</a> 
to 
Sonya, 
hugged 
her, 
and 
began 
to 
cry.

"A 
little 
wound, 
but 
he 
has 
been 
made 
an 
officer; 
he 
is 
well 
now, 
he
wrote 
himself," 
said 
she 
through 
her 
tears.
