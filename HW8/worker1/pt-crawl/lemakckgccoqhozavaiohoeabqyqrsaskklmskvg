promotion 
to 
the</h1>rank 
of 
major, 
and 
Rostov, 
who 
had 
already 
drunk
enough, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
feast 
proposed 
the 
Emperor's 
health. 
"Not
'our 
Sovereign, 
the 
Emperor,' 
as 
they 
say 
at 
official 
dinners,"
said 
he, 
"but 
the 
health 
of 
our 
Sovereign, 
that 
good, 
enchanting, 
and
great 
man! 
Let 
us 
drink 
to 
his 
health 
and 
to 
the 
certain 
defeat 
of 
the
French!"

"If 
we 
fought 
before," 
he 
said, 
"not 
letting 
the 
French 
pass, 
as
at 
Schoen 
Grabern, 
what 
shall 
we 
not 
do 
now 
when 
he 
is 
at 
the 
front? 
We
will 
all 
die 
for 
him 
gladly! 
Is 
it 
not 
so, 
gentlemen? 
Perhaps 
I 
am 
not
saying 
it 
right, 
I 
have 
drunk 
a 
good 
deal-but 
that 
is 
how 
I 
feel, 
and
so 
do 
you 
too!<p>
To 
the 
health 
of 
Alexander 
the 
First! 
Hurrah!"

"Hurrah!" 
rang 
the 
enthusiastic 
voices 
of 
the 
officers.

And 
the 
old 
cavalry 
captain, 
Kirsten, 
shouted 
enthusiastically 
and 
no
less 
sincerely 
than 
the 
twenty-year-old 
Rostov.

When 
the 
officers 
had 
emptied 
and 
smashed 
their 
glasses, 
Kirsten 
filled
others 
and, 
in 
shirt 
sleeves 
and 
breeches, 
went 
glass 
in 
hand 
to 
the
soldiers' 
bonfires 
and 
with 
his 
long 
gray 
mustache, 
his 
white 
chest
showing 
under 
his 
open 
shirt, 
he 
stood 
in 
a 
majestic 
pose 
in 
the 
light
of 
the<p>
campfire, 
waving 
his 
uplifted 
arm.

"Lads! 
here's 
to 
our 
Sovereign, 
the 
Emperor, 
and 
victory 
over
our 
enemies! 
Hurrah!" 
he 
exclaimed 
in 
his 
dashing, 
old, 
hussar's
baritone.

The 
hussars 
crowded 
round 
and 
responded 
heartily 
with 
loud 
shouts.

Late 
that 
night, 
when 
all 
had 
separated, 
Denisov 
with 
his 
short 
hand
patted 
his 
favorite, 
Rostov, 
on 
the 
shoulder.

"As 
there's 
no 
one 
to 
fall 
in 
love 
with 
on 
campaign, 
he's 
fallen
in 
love 
with 
the 
Tsar," 
he 
said.

"Denisov, 
don't 
make 
fun 
of 
it!" 
cried<p>
Rostov. 
"It 
is 
such 
a
lofty, 
beautiful 
feeling, 
such 
a..."

"I 
believe 
it, 
I 
believe 
it, 
fwiend, 
and 
I 
share 
and 
appwove..."

"No, 
you 
don't 
understand!"

And 
Rostov 
got 
up 
and 
went 
wandering 
among 
the 
campfires, 
dreaming 
of
what 
happiness 
it 
would<p>
be 
to 
die-not 
in 
saving 
the 
Emperor's 
life
(he 
did 
not 
even 
dare<p>
to 
dream 
of 
that), 
but 
simply 
to 
die 
before 
his
eyes. 
He 
really 
was 
in 
love 
with 
the 
Tsar 
and 
the 
glory 
of 
the 
Russian
arms 
and 
the 
hope 
of 
future 
triumph. 
And 
he 
was 
not 
the 
only 
man 
to
experience 
that 
feeling 
during 
those 
memorable 
days 
preceding 
the 
battle
of 
Austerlitz: 
nine 
tenths 
of 
the 
men 
in 
the 
Russian 
army 
were 
then 
in
love, 
though 
less 
ecstatically, 
with 
their 
Tsar 
and 
the 
glory 
of 
the
Russian 
arms.





CHAPTER 
XI

The 
next 
day 
the 
Emperor 
stopped 
at 
Wischau, 
and 
Villier, 
his 
physician,
was 
repeatedly 
summoned 
to 
see 
him. 
At 
headquarters 
and 
among 
the 
troops
near 
by 
the 
news 
spread 
that 
the 
Emperor 
was 
unwell. 
He 
ate 
nothing 
and
had 
slept 
badly 
that 
night, 
those 
around 
him 
reported. 
The 
cause 
of 
this
indisposition 
was 
the 
strong 
impression 
made 
on 
his 
sensitive 
mind 
by
the 
sight 
of 
the 
killed 
and 
wounded.

At 
daybreak 
on 
the 
seventeenth, 
a 
French 
officer 
who 
had 
come 
with
a 
flag 
of 
truce, 
demanding 
an 
audience 
with 
the 
Russian 
Emperor, 
was
brought 
into 
Wischau 
from 
our 
outposts. 
This 
officer 
was 
Savary. 
The
Emperor 
had 
only 
just 
fallen<p>
asleep 
and 
so 
Savary 
had 
to 
wait. 
At 
midday
he 
was 
admitted 
to 
the 
Emperor, 
and 
an 
hour 
later 
he 
rode 
off 
with
Prince 
Dolgorukov 
to 
the 
advanced 
post 
of 
the 
French 
army.

It 
was 
rumored 
that 
Savary 
had 
been 
sent 
to 
propose 
to 
Alexander
a 
meeting 
with 
Napoleon. 
To 
the 
joy 
and 
pride 
of 
the 
whole 
army, 
a
personal 
interview 
was 
refused, 
and 
instead 
of 
the 
Sovereign, 
Prince
Dolgorukov, 
the 
victor 
at 
Wischau, 
was 
sent 
with 
Savary 
to 
negotiate
with 
Napoleon 
if,
