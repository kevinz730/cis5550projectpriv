That
was 
all 
he 
thought 
about 
yesterday's 
ball, 
and 
after 
his 
morning 
tea
he 
set 
to 
work.

But 
either 
from 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZN11tHdfO4ZS.html">fatigue</a> 
or 
want 
of 
sleep 
he 
was 
ill-disposed 
for 
work
and 
could 
get 
<a href="/aVzUge/nyn3pVEYz3DkS9Jn.html">nothing</a> 
done. 
He 
kept 
criticizing 
his 
own 
work, 
as 
he
often 
did, 
and 
was 
glad 
when 
he 
heard 
someone 
coming.

The 
visitor 
was 
Bitski, 
who 
served 
on 
various 
committees, 
frequented
all 
the 
societies 
in 
Petersburg, 
and 
was 
a 
passionate 
devotee 
of 
the 
new
ideas 
and 
of 
Speranski, 
and 
a 
diligent 
Petersburg 
newsmonger-one 
of
those 
men 
who 
choose 
their 
opinions 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/SL6ej5WVP7nZs.html">like</a> 
their 
clothes 
according 
to
the 
fashion, 
but 
who 
for 
that 
very 
reason 
appear 
to 
be 
the 
warmest
partisans. 
Hardly 
had 
he 
got 
rid 
of 
his 
hat 
before 
he 
ran 
into 
Prince
Andrew's 
room 
with 
a<p>
preoccupied 
air 
and 
at 
once 
began 
talking. 
He
had 
just 
heard 
particulars 
of 
that 
morning's 
sitting 
of 
the 
Council
of 
State 
opened 
by 
the 
Emperor, 
and 
he 
spoke 
of 
it 
enthusiastically. 
The
Emperor's 
speech 
had 
been 
extraordinary. 
It 
had 
been 
a 
speech 
such 
as
only 
constitutional 
monarchs 
deliver. 
"The 
Sovereign 
plainly 
said
that 
the 
Council 
and 
Senate 
are 
estates 
of 
the 
realm, 
he 
said 
that 
the
government 
must 
rest 
not 
on 
authority 
but 
on 
secure 
bases. 
The 
Emperor
said 
that 
the 
fiscal 
system 
must 
be 
reorganized 
and 
the 
accounts
published," 
recounted 
Bitski, 
emphasizing 
certain 
words 
and 
opening
his 
eyes 
significantly.

"Ah, 
yes! 
Today's 
events 
mark 
an 
epoch, 
the 
greatest 
epoch 
in<p>
our
history," 
he 
concluded.

Prince 
Andrew 
listened 
to 
the 
account 
of 
the 
opening<p>
of 
the 
Council 
of
State, 
which 
he 
had 
so 
impatiently 
awaited 
and 
to 
which 
he 
had 
attached
such 
importance, 
and 
was 
surprised 
that 
this 
event, 
now 
that 
it 
had
taken 
place, 
did 
not 
affect 
him, 
and 
even 
seemed 
quite 
insignificant. 
He
listened 
with 
quiet 
irony 
to 
Bitski's 
enthusiastic 
account 
of 
it. 
A
very<p>
simple 
thought 
occurred 
to 
him: 
"What 
does 
it 
matter 
to 
me 
or 
to
Bitski 
what 
the 
Emperor 
was 
pleased 
to 
say 
at 
the 
Council? 
Can 
all 
that
make 
me 
any 
happier 
or 
better?"

And 
this 
simple 
reflection 
suddenly 
destroyed 
all 
the 
interest 
Prince
Andrew 
had 
felt 
in 
the 
impending 
reforms. 
He 
was 
going 
to 
dine 
that
evening 
at 
Speranski's, 
"with 
only 
a 
few 
friends," 
as 
the 
host
had 
said 
when 
inviting 
him. 
The 
prospect 
of 
that 
dinner 
in 
the 
intimate
home 
circle 
of 
the 
man 
he 
so 
admired 
had 
greatly 
interested 
Prince
Andrew, 
especially 
as 
he 
had 
not 
yet 
seen 
Speranski 
in 
his 
domestic
surroundings, 
but 
now 
he 
felt 
disinclined 
to 
go 
to 
it.
