"Nicholas,
Nicholas!" 
she 
said, 
turning 
to 
her 
brother, 
as 
if<p>
asking 
him: 
"What
is 
it 
moves 
me 
so?"

Nicholas 
too 
was 
greatly 
pleased 
by 
"Uncle's" 
playing, 
and
"Uncle" 
played 
the 
piece 
over 
again. 
Anisya 
Fedorovna's 
smiling
face 
reappeared 
in 
the 
doorway 
and 
behind 
hers 
other 
faces...

 
 
 
 
Fetching 
water 
clear 
and 
sweet,
 
 
 
 
Stop, 
dear 
maiden, 
I 
entreat-

played 
"Uncle" 
once 
more, 
running 
his 
fingers 
skillfully 
over 
the
strings, 
and 
then 
he 
stopped 
short 
and 
jerked 
his 
shoulders.

"Go 
on, 
Uncle 
dear," 
Natasha 
wailed 
in 
an 
imploring 
tone 
as 
if 
her
life 
depended 
on 
it.

"Uncle" 
rose, 
and 
it 
was 
as 
if 
there 
were 
two 
men 
in 
him: 
one 
of
them 
smiled 
seriously 
at 
the 
merry 
fellow, 
while 
the 
merry 
fellow 
struck
a 
naive 
and 
precise 
attitude 
preparatory 
to 
a 
folk 
dance.

"Now 
then, 
niece!" 
he 
exclaimed, 
waving 
to 
Natasha 
the<p>
hand 
that
had 
just 
struck 
a 
chord.

Natasha 
threw 
off 
the 
shawl 
from 
her 
shoulders, 
ran 
forward 
to 
face
"Uncle," 
and 
setting 
her 
arms 
akimbo 
also 
made 
a 
motion 
with 
her
shoulders 
and 
struck 
an 
attitude.

Where, 
how, 
and 
when 
had 
this 
young 
countess, 
educated 
by 
an 
emigree
French 
governess, 
imbibed 
from 
the 
Russian 
air 
she 
breathed 
that 
spirit
and 
obtained 
that 
manner 
which 
the 
pas 
de 
chale 
* 
would, 
one 
would 
have
supposed, 
long 
ago 
have 
effaced? 
But 
the 
spirit 
and 
the 
movements 
were
those 
inimitable 
and 
unteachable 
Russian 
ones 
that 
"Uncle" 
had
expected 
of 
her. 
As 
soon 
as 
she 
had 
struck 
her 
pose, 
and 
smiled
triumphantly, 
proudly, 
and 
with 
sly 
merriment, 
the 
fear 
that 
had 
at
first 
seized 
Nicholas 
and 
the 
others 
that 
she 
might 
not 
do 
the 
right
thing 
was 
at 
an 
end, 
and 
they 
were 
already 
admiring 
her.

The 
French

dance.

She 
did 
the 
right 
thing 
with 
such 
precision, 
such 
complete 
precision,
that 
Anisya 
Fedorovna, 
who 
had 
at 
once 
handed 
her 
the 
handkerchief 
she
needed 
for 
the 
dance, 
had 
tears 
in 
her 
eyes, 
though 
she 
laughed 
as 
she
watched 
this 
slim, 
graceful 
countess, 
reared 
in 
silks 
and 
velvets 
and 
so
different 
from 
herself, 
who 
yet 
was 
able 
to 
understand 
all 
that 
was
in 
Anisya 
and
