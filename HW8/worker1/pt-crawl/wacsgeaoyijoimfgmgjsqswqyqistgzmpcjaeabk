the 
enemy.
On 
the 
tenth 
of 
August 
the 
regiment 
Prince 
Andrew 
commanded 
was 
marching
along 
the 
highroad 
past 
the 
avenue 
leading 
to 
Bald 
Hills. 
Heat 
and
drought 
had 
continued 
for 
more 
than 
three 
weeks. 
Each 
day 
fleecy 
clouds
floated 
across 
the 
sky 
and 
occasionally 
veiled 
the 
sun, 
but 
toward
evening 
the 
sky 
cleared 
again 
and 
the 
sun 
set 
in 
reddish-brown 
mist.
Heavy 
night 
dews 
alone 
refreshed 
the 
earth. 
The 
unreaped 
corn 
was
scorched 
and 
shed 
its 
grain. 
The 
marshes 
dried 
up. 
The 
cattle 
lowed 
from
hunger, 
finding 
no 
food 
on 
the 
sun-parched 
meadows. 
Only 
at 
night 
and
in 
the 
forests 
while 
the 
dew 
lasted 
was 
there 
any 
freshness. 
But 
on 
the
road, 
the 
highroad 
along 
which 
the 
troops 
marched, 
there 
was 
no 
such
freshness 
even 
at 
night 
or 
when 
the 
road 
passed 
through 
the 
forest; 
the
dew 
was 
imperceptible 
on 
the 
sandy 
dust 
churned 
up 
more 
than 
six 
inches
deep. 
As 
soon 
as 
day 
dawned 
the 
march 
began. 
The 
artillery 
and 
baggage
wagons 
moved 
noiselessly 
through 
the 
deep 
dust 
that 
rose 
to 
the 
very
hubs 
of 
the 
wheels, 
and 
the 
infantry 
sank 
ankle-deep 
in 
that 
soft,
choking, 
hot 
dust 
that 
never 
cooled 
even 
at 
night. 
Some 
of 
this 
dust
was 
kneaded 
by 
the 
feet 
and 
wheels, 
while 
the 
rest 
rose 
and 
hung 
like 
a
cloud 
over 
the 
troops, 
settling 
in 
eyes, 
ears, 
hair, 
and 
nostrils, 
and
worst 
of 
all 
in 
the 
lungs 
of 
the 
men 
and 
beasts 
as 
they 
moved 
along 
that
road. 
The 
higher 
the 
sun 
rose 
the 
higher 
rose 
that 
cloud 
of 
dust, 
and
through 
the 
screen 
of<p>
its 
hot 
fine 
particles 
one 
could 
look 
with 
naked
eye 
at 
the 
sun, 
which 
showed 
like 
a 
huge 
crimson 
ball 
in 
the 
unclouded
sky. 
There 
was 
no 
wind, 
and 
the 
men 
choked<p>
in 
that 
motionless
atmosphere. 
They 
marched 
with 
handkerchiefs 
tied 
over 
their 
noses 
and
mouths. 
When 
they 
passed 
through 
a 
village 
they 
all 
rushed 
to 
the 
wells
and 
fought 
for 
the 
water 
and 
drank 
it 
down 
to 
the 
mud.
