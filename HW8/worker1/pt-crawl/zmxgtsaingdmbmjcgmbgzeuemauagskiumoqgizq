Most 
of 
the 
people 
at
that 
time 
paid 
no 
attention 
to 
the 
general 
progress 
of 
events 
but 
were
guided 
only 
by 
their 
private<p>
interests, 
and 
they 
were 
the 
very 
people
whose 
activities 
at 
that 
period 
were 
most 
useful.

Those 
who 
tried 
to 
understand<p>
the 
general 
course 
of 
events 
and 
to 
take
part 
in 
it 
by 
self-sacrifice 
and 
heroism 
were 
the 
most 
useless 
members
of 
society, 
they 
saw 
everything 
upside 
down, 
and 
all 
they 
did 
for 
the
common 
good 
turned 
out 
to 
be 
useless 
and 
foolish-like 
Pierre's 
and
Mamonov's<p>
regiments 
which 
looted 
Russian 
villages, 
and 
the 
lint 
the
young 
ladies 
prepared 
and 
that 
never 
reached 
the 
wounded, 
and 
so 
on.
Even 
those, 
fond 
of 
intellectual 
talk 
and 
of 
expressing 
their 
feelings,
who<p>
discussed 
Russia's 
position 
at 
the 
time 
involuntarily 
introduced
into 
their 
conversation 
either 
a 
shade 
of 
pretense 
and 
falsehood 
or
useless 
condemnation 
and 
anger 
directed 
against 
people 
accused 
of
actions 
no 
one 
could 
possibly 
be 
guilty 
of. 
In 
historic 
events 
the 
rule
forbidding 
us 
to 
eat 
of 
the 
fruit 
of 
the 
Tree 
of 
Knowledge 
is 
specially
applicable. 
Only 
unconscious 
action 
bears 
fruit, 
and 
he 
who 
plays 
a 
part
in 
an 
historic 
event 
never 
understands 
its 
significance. 
If 
he 
tries 
to
realize 
it 
his 
efforts 
are 
fruitless.

The 
more 
closely 
a 
man 
was 
engaged 
in 
the 
events 
then 
taking 
place 
in
Russia 
the 
less 
did 
he 
realize 
their 
significance. 
In 
Petersburg 
and
in 
the 
provinces 
at 
a 
distance 
from 
Moscow, 
ladies, 
and 
gentlemen 
in
militia 
uniforms, 
wept 
for 
Russia 
and 
its 
ancient 
capital 
and 
talked 
of
self-sacrifice 
and 
so 
on; 
but 
in 
the 
army 
which 
retired 
beyond 
Moscow
there 
was 
little 
talk 
or 
thought 
of 
Moscow, 
and 
when 
they 
caught 
sight
of 
its 
burned 
ruins
