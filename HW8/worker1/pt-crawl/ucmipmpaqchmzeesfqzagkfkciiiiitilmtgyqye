Telyanin,<p>
a 
small</h1>officer 
of 
the 
same 
squadron,
entered 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Te7wUl7SFG4.html">the</a> 
room.

Rostov 
thrust 
the 
purse 
under 
the 
pillow<p>
and 
shook 
the 
damp 
little 
hand
which 
was 
offered 
him. 
Telyanin 
for 
some 
reason 
had 
been 
transferred
from 
the 
Guards 
just 
before 
this 
campaign. 
He 
behaved 
very 
well 
in 
the
regiment 
but 
was 
not 
liked; 
Rostov 
especially 
detested 
him 
and 
was
unable 
to 
overcome 
or 
conceal 
his 
groundless 
antipathy 
to 
the 
man.

"Well, 
young 
cavalryman, 
how 
is 
my 
Rook 
behaving?" 
he 
asked. 
(Rook
was 
a 
young 
horse 
Telyanin 
had 
<a href="/cZl/IMv9i5SXnSa2fCtXF.html">sold</a> 
to 
Rostov.)

The 
lieutenant 
never 
looked 
the 
man 
he 
was 
speaking 
to 
straight 
in 
the
face; 
his 
eyes 
continually 
wandered 
from 
one 
object 
to 
another.
