furtively 
at 
Alpatych

lowered
his 
eyes.

"You 
drop 
this 
nonsense 
and 
tell 
the 
people 
to 
get 
ready 
to 
leave 
their
homes 
and 
go 
to 
Moscow 
and 
to 
get 
carts 
ready 
for 
tomorrow 
morning
for 
the 
princess' 
things. 
And 
don't 
go 
to 
any 
meeting 
yourself, 
do 
you
hear?"

Dron 
suddenly 
fell 
on 
his 
knees.

"Yakov 
Alpatych, 
discharge 
me! 
Take 
the 
keys 
from 
me 
and 
discharge 
me,
for 
Christ's 
sake!"

"Stop 
that!" 
cried 
Alpatych 
sternly. 
"I 
see 
through 
you 
and 
three 
yards
under 
you," 
he 
repeated, 
knowing 
that 
his 
skill 
in 
beekeeping, 
his
knowledge 
of 
the 
right 
time 
to 
sow 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/jV9UybKc6JyP7PwKxs.html">oats,</a> 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
he 
had
been 
able 
to 
retain 
the 
old 
prince's 
favor 
for 
twenty 
years 
had 
long
since 
gained 
him 
the 
reputation 
of 
being 
a 
wizard, 
and 
that 
the 
power 
of
seeing 
three 
yards 
under 
a 
man 
is 
considered 
an 
attribute 
of 
wizards.

Dron 
got 
up 
and 
was 
about 
to 
say 
something, 
but 
Alpatych 
interrupted
him.

"What 
is 
it 
you 
have 
got 
into 
your 
heads, 
eh?... 
What 
are 
you 
thinking
of, 
eh?"

"What 
<a href="/cZl/BP2XQ9XHd4N.html">am</a> 
I 
to 
do 
with 
the 
people?" 
said 
Dron. 
"They're 
quite 
beside
themselves; 
I 
have 
already 
told 
them..."

"'Told

Alpatych.
