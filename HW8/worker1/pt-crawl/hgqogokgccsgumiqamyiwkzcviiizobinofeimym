was 
about, 
went<p>
across 
the 
room<p>
to 
where 
Pierre 
was 
standing 
and 
gave
him 
a 
taper. 
He 
lit 
it 
and, 
distracted 
<a href="/aVzUge/kZ8e24mbEd.html">by</a> 
observing 
those 
around 
him,
began 
crossing 
himself 
with 
the 
hand 
that 
held 
the 
taper.

Sophie, 
the 
rosy, 
laughter-loving, 
youngest 
princess 
with 
the 
mole,
watched 
him. 
She 
smiled, 
hid 
her 
face 
in 
her 
handkerchief, 
and 
remained
with 
it 
hidden 
for 
awhile; 
then 
looking 
up 
and 
seeing 
Pierre 
she
again 
began 
to 
laugh. 
She 
evidently 
felt 
unable 
to 
look 
at 
him
without 
laughing, 
but 
could 
not 
resist 
looking 
at 
him: 
so 
to 
be 
out 
of
temptation 
she 
slipped 
quietly 
behind 
one 
of 
the 
columns. 
In 
the 
midst
of 
the 
service 
the 
voices 
of 
the 
priests 
suddenly 
ceased, 
they 
whispered
to 
one 
another, 
and 
the 
old 
servant 
who 
was 
holding 
the 
count's 
hand
got 
up 
and 
said 
something 
to 
the 
ladies. 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
stepped
forward 
and, 
stooping 
over 
the 
dying 
man, 
beckoned 
to 
Lorrain 
from
behind 
her 
back. 
The 
French 
doctor 
held 
no 
taper; 
he 
was 
leaning
against 
one 
of 
the 
columns 
in 
a 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/FW2mbEd87g.html">respectful</a> 
attitude 
implying 
that 
he,
a 
foreigner, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
differences 
of 
faith, 
understood 
the 
full
importance 
of 
the 
rite 
now 
being 
performed 
and 
even 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Rx8tTlW7OpC2BwOO.html">approved</a> 
of 
it. 
He
now 
approached 
the 
sick 
man 
with 
the 
noiseless 
step 
of 
one 
in 
full 
vigor
of 
life, 
with 
his 
delicate 
white 
fingers 
raised 
from 
the 
green 
quilt 
the
hand 
that 
was 
free, 
and 
turning 
sideways 
felt 
the 
pulse 
and 
reflected
a 
moment. 
The 
sick 
man 
was 
given 
something 
to 
drink, 
there 
was 
a
stir 
around 
him, 
then 
the 
people 
resumed 
their 
places 
and 
the 
service
continued. 
During 
this 
interval 
Pierre 
noticed 
that 
Prince 
Vasili
left 
the 
chair 
on 
which 
he 
had 
been 
leaning, 
and-with 
an 
air
which 
intimated 
that 
he 
knew 
what 
he<p>
was 
about 
and 
if 
others 
did 
not
understand 
him 
it 
was<p>
so 
much 
the 
worse 
<a href="/aVzUge/mx1EnBVm2o0EoOV.html">for</a> 
them-did 
not 
go 
up 
to 
the
dying 
man, 
but 
passed 
by 
him, 
joined 
the 
eldest 
princess, 
and 
moved
with 
her 
to 
the 
side 
of 
the 
room 
where 
stood 
the 
high 
bedstead 
with 
its
silken 
hangings. 
On 
leaving 
the 
bed 
both 
Prince 
Vasili 
and 
the 
princess
passed 
out 
by 
a 
back 
door, 
but 
returned 
to 
their 
places 
one 
after 
the
other 
before 
the 
service 
was 
concluded. 
Pierre 
paid 
no 
more 
attention
to 
this 
occurrence 
than 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
what 
went 
on, 
having 
made 
up 
his
mind 
once 
for 
all 
that 
what 
he 
saw 
happening 
around 
him
