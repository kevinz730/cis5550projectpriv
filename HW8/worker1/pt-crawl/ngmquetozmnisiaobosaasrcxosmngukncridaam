"Well, 
sit</h1>down, 
sit 
down 
here. 
Let's 
have 
a 
talk," 
said 
Kutuzov. 
"It's
sad, 
very 
sad. 
But 
remember, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
that 
I 
am 
a 
father 
to 
you,
a 
second 
father...."

Prince 
Andrew 
told 
Kutuzov 
all 
he 
knew 
of 
his 
father's 
death, 
and 
what
he 
had 
seen 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
when 
he 
passed 
through 
it.

"What... 
what 
they 
have 
brought 
us 
to!" 
Kutuzov 
suddenly 
cried 
in 
an
agitated 
voice, 
evidently 
picturing 
vividly 
to 
himself 
from 
Prince
Andrew's 
story 
the 
condition 
Russia 
was 
in. 
"But 
give 
me 
time, 
give 
me
time!" 
he 
said 
with<p>
a<p>
grim 
look, 
evidently 
not 
wishing 
to 
continue 
this
agitating 
conversation, 
and 
added: 
"I 
sent 
for 
you 
to 
keep 
you 
with 
me."

"I 
thank 
your 
Serene 
Highness, 
but 
I 
fear 
I 
am 
no 
longer 
fit 
for 
the
staff," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
a 
smile 
which 
Kutuzov 
noticed.

Kutuzov 
glanced 
inquiringly 
at 
him.

"But 
above 
all," 
added 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"I 
have 
grown 
used 
to 
my 
regiment,
am 
fond 
of 
the 
officers, 
and 
I 
fancy 
the 
men 
also 
like 
me. 
I 
should 
be
sorry 
to 
leave<p>
the 
regiment. 
If 
I 
decline 
the 
honor 
of 
being 
with 
you,
believe 
me..."

A 
shrewd, 
kindly, 
yet 
subtly 
derisive 
expression 
lit 
up 
Kutuzov's 
podgy
face. 
He 
cut 
Bolkonski 
short.

"I 
am 
sorry, 
for 
I 
need 
you. 
But 
you're 
right, 
you're 
right! 
It's 
not
here 
that 
men 
are 
needed. 
Advisers 
are 
always 
plentiful, 
but 
men 
are
not. 
The 
regiments 
would 
not 
be 
what 
they 
are 
if 
the 
would-be 
advisers
served 
there 
as 
you 
do. 
I 
remember 
you 
at 
Austerlitz.... 
I 
remember,
yes, 
I 
remember 
you 
with 
the 
standard!" 
said 
Kutuzov, 
and 
a 
flush<p>
of
pleasure 
suffused 
Prince 
Andrew's 
face 
at 
this 
recollection.

Taking 
his 
hand 
and 
drawing 
him 
downwards, 
Kutuzov 
offered 
his 
cheek 
to
be 
kissed, 
and 
again 
Prince 
Andrew 
noticed 
tears 
in 
the 
old 
man's 
eyes.
Though 
Prince 
Andrew 
knew 
that 
<a href="/cZl/eg3FX45.html">Kutuzov's</a> 
tears 
came 
easily, 
and 
that 
he
was 
particularly 
tender 
to 
and 
considerate 
of 
him 
from 
a 
wish 
to
show 
sympathy 
with 
his 
loss, 
yet 
this 
reminder 
of 
Austerlitz 
was 
both
pleasant 
and 
flattering 
to 
him.

"Go 
your 
way 
and 
God 
be 
with 
you. 
I 
know 
your 
path 
is 
the 
path 
of
honor!" 
He 
paused. 
"I 
missed 
you 
at 
Bucharest, 
but 
I 
needed 
someone 
to
send." 
And 
changing 
the 
subject, 
Kutuzov 
began 
to 
speak<p>
of 
the 
Turkish
war 
and 
the 
peace 
that 
had 
been 
concluded. 
"Yes, 
I 
have 
been 
much
blamed," 
he 
said, 
"both 
for 
that 
war 
and 
the 
peace... 
but 
everything
came 
at 
the 
right 
time. 
Tout<p>
vient 
a 
point 
a 
celui<p>
qui 
sait 
attendre. 
*
And 
there 
were 
as 
many 
advisers 
there 
as 
here..." 
he 
went 
on, 
returning
to 
the 
subject 
of 
"advisers" 
which 
evidently 
occupied 
him. 
"Ah, 
those
advisers!" 
said 
he. 
"If 
we 
had 
listened 
to 
them 
all 
we 
should 
not 
have
made<p>
peace 
with 
Turkey 
and 
should 
not 
have 
been 
through 
with 
that 
war.
Everything 
in 
haste, 
but 
more 
haste, 
less 
speed. 
Kamenski 
would 
have
been 
lost 
if 
he 
had 
not 
died. 
He 
stormed 
fortresses 
with 
thirty 
thousand
men. 
It 
is 
not 
difficult 
to 
capture 
a 
fortress 
but 
it 
is 
difficult 
to
win 
a 
campaign. 
For 
that, 
not 
storming 
and 
attacking 
but
