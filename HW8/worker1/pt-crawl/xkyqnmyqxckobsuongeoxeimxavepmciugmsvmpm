he</h1>quietly 
died; 
and
next 
day 
a 
throng 
of 
acquaintances 
who 
came 
to 
pay 
their 
last 
respects
to 
the 
deceased 
filled 
the 
house 
rented<p>
by 
the 
Rostovs. 
All 
these
acquaintances, 
who 
had 
so 
often 
dined 
and 
danced 
at 
his 
house 
and 
had 
so
often 
laughed 
at 
him, 
now 
said, 
with 
a 
common 
feeling 
of 
self-reproach
and 
emotion, 
as 
if 
justifying 
themselves: 
"Well, 
whatever 
he 
may 
have
been 
he 
was 
a 
most 
worthy 
man. 
You 
don't 
meet 
such 
men 
nowadays.... 
And
which 
of 
us 
has 
not 
weaknesses 
of 
his 
own?"

It 
was 
just 
when 
the 
count's 
affairs 
had 
become 
so 
involved 
that 
it 
was
impossible 
to 
say 
what 
would 
happen 
if 
he 
lived 
another 
year 
that 
he
unexpectedly 
died.

Nicholas 
was 
with 
the 
Russian 
army 
in 
Paris 
when 
the 
news 
of 
his
father's 
death 
reached 
him. 
He 
at 
once 
resigned 
his 
commission, 
and
without 
waiting 
for 
it 
to 
be 
accepted<p>
took 
leave 
of 
absence 
and 
went 
to
Moscow. 
The 
state 
of 
the 
count's 
affairs 
became 
quite 
obvious 
a 
month
after 
his 
death, 
surprising 
everyone 
by 
the 
immense 
total 
of 
small
debts 
the 
existence 
of 
which 
no 
one 
had 
suspected. 
The 
debts 
amounted 
to
double 
the 
value 
of 
the 
property.

Friends 
and 
relations 
advised 
Nicholas 
to 
decline 
the 
inheritance. 
But
he 
regarded 
such 
a 
refusal 
as 
a 
slur 
on 
his 
father's 
memory, 
which 
he
held 
sacred, 
and 
therefore 
would 
not 
hear 
of 
refusing 
and 
accepted 
the
inheritance 
together 
with 
the 
obligation 
to 
pay 
the 
debts.

The 
creditors 
who 
had 
so 
long 
been 
silent, 
restrained 
by 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/JB3oqw19kK.html">vague
but</a> 
powerful 
influence 
exerted 
on 
them 
while 
he 
lived 
by 
the 
count's
careless 
good 
nature, 
all 
proceeded 
to 
enforce 
their 
claims 
at 
once. 
As
always 
happens 
in 
such 
cases 
rivalry 
sprang 
up 
as 
to 
which 
should 
get
paid 
first, 
and 
those 
who 
like 
Mitenka 
held 
promissory 
notes 
given 
them
as 
presents 
now 
became 
the 
most 
exacting 
of 
the 
creditors. 
Nicholas 
was
allowed 
no 
respite 
and 
no 
peace, 
and 
those 
who 
had 
seemed 
to 
pity
the 
old 
man-the 
cause 
of 
their 
losses 
(if 
they 
were 
losses)-now
remorselessly 
pursued 
the 
young 
heir 
who 
had 
voluntarily 
undertaken 
the
debts 
and 
was 
obviously 
not 
guilty 
of 
contracting 
them.

Not 
one 
of 
the 
plans 
Nicholas 
tried 
succeeded; 
the 
estate 
was 
sold 
by
auction 
for 
half 
its 
value, 
and 
half 
the 
debts 
still 
remained
unpaid. 
Nicholas 
accepted 
thirty 
thousand 
rubles 
offered 
him 
by 
his
brother-in-law 
Bezukhov 
to 
pay 
off 
debts 
he 
regarded 
as 
genuinely 
due
for 
value 
received. 
And 
to 
avoid 
being 
imprisoned 
for 
the<p>
remainder, 
as
the 
creditors 
threatened, 
he 
re-entered 
the 
government 
service.

He 
could 
not 
rejoin 
the 
army 
where 
he 
would 
have 
been 
made 
colonel 
at
the 
next 
vacancy, 
for 
his 
mother 
now 
clung 
to 
him 
as 
her 
one 
hold 
on
life;<p>
and 
so 
despite 
his 
reluctance<p>
to 
remain 
in 
Moscow 
among 
people 
who
had 
known 
him 
before, 
and 
despite 
his 
abhorrence 
of 
the 
civil 
service,
he 
accepted 
a 
post 
in 
Moscow 
in 
that 
service, 
doffed 
the 
uniform 
of
which 
he 
was 
so 
fond, 
and 
moved 
with 
his 
mother 
and 
Sonya 
to 
a 
small
house 
on 
the 
Sivtsev 
Vrazhok.

Natasha 
and 
Pierre 
were 
living 
in 
Petersburg 
at 
the 
time 
and 
had 
no
clear 
idea 
of 
Nicholas' 
circumstances. 
Having 
borrowed 
money 
from 
his
brother-in-law, 
Nicholas 
tried 
to 
hide 
his 
wretched 
condition 
from 
him.
His 
position 
was 
the 
more 
difficult 
because 
with 
his 
salary 
of 
twelve
hundred 
rubles 
he 
had 
not 
only 
to 
keep 
himself, 
his 
mother, 
and 
Sonya,
but 
had 
to 
shield 
his 
mother 
from 
knowledge 
of 
their 
poverty. 
The
countess 
could 
not 
conceive 
of 
life 
without 
the 
luxurious 
conditions 
she
had 
been 
used 
to 
from 
childhood 
and, 
unable 
to 
realize 
how 
hard 
it 
was
for 
her 
son, 
kept 
demanding 
now 
a 
carriage 
(which 
they 
did 
not 
keep) 
to
send 
for 
a 
friend, 
now 
some 
expensive 
article 
of 
food 
for 
herself, 
or
wine 
for 
her 
son, 
or 
money 
to 
buy 
a 
present 
as<p>
a 
surprise 
for 
Natasha 
or
Sonya, 
or 
for 
Nicholas
