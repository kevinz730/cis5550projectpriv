alarm 
to 
Bezukhov.

"Don't!<p>
Don't! 
What</h1>are 
you 
about?" 
whispered 
their 
frightened
voices.

Dolokhov 
looked 
at 
Pierre 
with 
clear, 
mirthful, 
cruel 
eyes, 
and 
that
smile 
of 
his 
which 
seemed 
to 
say, 
"Ah! 
This 
is 
what 
I 
like!"

"You 
shan't 
have 
it!" 
he 
said 
distinctly.

Pale, 
with 
quivering 
lips, 
Pierre 
snatched 
the 
copy.

"You...! 
you... 
scoundrel! 
I 
challenge 
you!" 
he<p>
ejaculated, 
and,
pushing 
back 
his 
chair, 
he 
rose 
from 
the 
table.

At 
the 
very 
instant 
he 
did 
this 
and 
uttered 
those 
words, 
Pierre 
felt
that 
the 
question 
of 
his 
wife's 
guilt 
which 
had 
been 
tormenting 
him
the 
whole 
day 
was 
finally 
and 
indubitably 
answered 
in 
the<p>
affirmative.
He 
hated 
her 
and 
was 
forever 
sundered 
from 
her. 
Despite 
Denisov's
request 
that 
he 
would 
take 
no 
part 
in 
the 
matter, 
Rostov 
agreed 
to 
be
Dolokhov's 
second, 
and 
after 
dinner 
he 
discussed<p>
the 
arrangements 
for
the 
duel 
with 
Nesvitski, 
Bezukhov's 
second. 
Pierre 
went 
home, 
but
Rostov 
with 
Dolokhov 
and 
Denisov 
stayed 
on 
at 
the 
club<p>
till 
late,
listening 
to 
the 
gypsies 
and 
other 
singers.

"Well 
then, 
till 
tomorrow 
at 
Sokolniki," 
said 
Dolokhov, 
as 
he<p>
took
leave 
of 
Rostov 
in 
the 
club 
porch.

"And 
do 
you 
feel 
quite 
calm?" 
Rostov 
asked.

Dolokhov 
<a href="/cZl/nr9b2U5YysHj.html">paused.

"Well,</a> 
you 
see, 
I'll 
tell 
you 
the 
whole 
secret 
of 
dueling 
in 
two
words. 
If 
you 
are 
going 
to 
fight 
a 
duel, 
and 
you 
make 
a 
will 
and 
write
affectionate 
letters 
to 
your 
parents, 
and 
if 
you 
think 
you 
may 
be
killed, 
you 
are 
a 
fool 
and 
are 
lost 
for 
certain. 
But 
go 
with 
the 
firm
intention 
of 
killing 
your 
man 
as 
quickly 
and 
surely 
as 
possible, 
and
then 
all 
will 
be 
right, 
as 
our 
bear 
huntsman 
at 
Kostroma 
used 
to 
tell
me. 
'Everyone 
fears 
a 
bear,' 
he 
says, 
'but 
when 
you 
see 
one 
your
fear's 
all 
gone, 
and 
your 
only 
thought 
is 
not 
to 
let 
him 
get 
away!'
And 
that's 
how 
it 
is 
with 
me. 
A 
demain, 
mon 
cher."

* 
Till 
tomorrow, 
my 
dear 
fellow.

Next 
day, 
at 
eight 
in 
the 
morning, 
Pierre 
and 
Nesvitski 
drove 
to 
the
Sokolniki 
forest 
and 
found 
Dolokhov, 
Denisov, 
and 
Rostov 
already
there. 
Pierre 
had 
the 
air 
of 
a 
man 
preoccupied 
with 
considerations 
which
had 
no 
connection 
with 
the 
matter 
in 
hand. 
His 
haggard 
face 
was 
yellow.
He 
had 
evidently 
not 
slept 
that 
night. 
He 
looked 
about 
distractedly 
and
screwed 
up 
his 
eyes 
as 
if 
dazzled 
by 
the 
sun. 
He 
was 
entirely 
absorbed
by 
two 
considerations: 
his 
wife's 
guilt, 
of 
which 
after 
his 
sleepless
night 
he 
had 
not 
the 
slightest 
doubt, 
and 
the 
guiltlessness 
of
Dolokhov, 
who 
had 
no 
reason 
to 
preserve 
the 
honor 
of 
a 
man 
who 
was
nothing 
to 
him.... 
"I 
should 
perhaps 
have 
done 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
his
place," 
thought 
Pierre. 
"It's 
even<p>
certain 
that 
I 
should 
have 
done
the 
same, 
then 
why 
this 
duel, 
this 
murder? 
Either 
I 
shall 
kill 
him, 
or
he 
will 
hit 
me 
in 
the 
head, 
or 
elbow, 
or 
knee. 
Can't 
I 
go 
away 
from
here, 
run 
away, 
bury 
myself 
somewhere?" 
passed 
through 
his 
mind. 
But
just 
at 
moments 
when 
such 
thoughts 
occurred 
to 
him, 
he 
would 
ask 
in 
a
particularly 
calm 
and 
absent-minded 
way, 
which 
inspired 
the 
respect 
of
the 
onlookers, 
"Will 
it 
be 
long? 
Are 
things 
ready?"

When 
all 
was 
ready, 
the 
sabers 
stuck 
in 
the 
snow 
to 
mark 
the 
barriers,
and 
the 
pistols 
loaded, 
Nesvitski 
went 
up 
to 
Pierre.

"I 
should 
not 
be 
doing 
my 
duty, 
Count," 
he 
said 
in 
timid 
tones,
"and 
should 
not 
justify 
your 
confidence 
and 
the 
honor 
you 
have 
done
me 
in 
choosing 
me 
for 
your 
second, 
if 
at 
this 
grave, 
this 
very
grave, 
moment 
I 
did 
not 
tell 
you 
the 
whole 
truth. 
I 
think 
there 
is 
no
sufficient 
ground 
for 
this 
affair, 
or 
for 
blood 
to 
be 
shed 
over 
it....
You 
were 
not 
right, 
not 
quite 
in 
the 
right, 
you 
were 
impetuous..."

"Oh 
yes,
