the
gentlefolk 
rode 
up 
to 
him</h1>at 
a 
footpace; 
the 
hounds 
that 
were 
far 
off
on 
the 
horizon 
turned 
away 
from 
the 
hare, 
and 
the 
whips, 
but 
not 
the
gentlefolk, 
also 
moved 
away. 
All 
were 
moving 
slowly 
and 
sedately.

"How 
is 
it 
pointing?" 
asked 
Nicholas, 
riding 
a 
hundred 
paces 
toward
the 
whip 
who 
had 
sighted 
the 
hare.

But 
before 
the 
whip 
could 
reply, 
the 
hare, 
scenting 
the 
frost 
coming
next 
morning, 
was 
unable 
to 
rest 
and 
leaped 
up. 
The 
pack 
on 
leash 
rushed
downhill 
in 
full 
cry 
after 
the 
hare, 
and 
from 
all 
sides 
the 
borzois 
that
were 
not 
on 
leash 
darted 
after 
the 
hounds 
and 
the 
hare. 
All 
the 
hunt,
who 
had 
been 
moving 
slowly, 
shouted, 
"Stop!" 
calling 
in 
the 
hounds,
while 
the 
borzoi 
whips, 
with 
a 
cry 
of 
<a href="/cZl/NP2D1vf5ezc.html">"A-tu!"</a> 
galloped 
across 
the
field 
setting 
the 
borzois 
on 
the 
hare. 
The 
tranquil 
Ilagin, 
Nicholas,
Natasha, 
and 
"Uncle" 
flew, 
reckless 
of 
where 
and 
how 
they 
went,
seeing 
only 
the 
borzois 
and 
the 
hare 
and<p>
fearing 
only 
to 
lose 
sight 
even
for 
an 
instant 
of 
the 
chase. 
The 
hare 
they 
had 
started 
was 
a 
strong 
and
swift 
one. 
When 
he 
jumped 
up 
he 
did 
not 
run 
at 
once, 
but 
pricked 
his
ears 
<a href="/aVzUge/vr6SN46GSfdQ.html">listening</a> 
to 
the 
shouting 
and 
trampling 
that 
resounded 
from
