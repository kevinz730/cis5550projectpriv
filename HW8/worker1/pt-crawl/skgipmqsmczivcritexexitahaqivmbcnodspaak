PROCLAMATION

You, 
peaceful 
inhabitants 
of 
Moscow, 
artisans 
and 
workmen 
whom
misfortune 
has 
driven 
from 
the 
city, 
and 
you 
scattered 
tillers 
of
the 
soil, 
still 
kept 
out<p>
in 
the 
fields 
by 
groundless 
fear, 
listen!
Tranquillity 
is 
<a href="/cZl/zW4fLYk6Im2w.html">returning</a> 
to 
this 
capital 
and 
order 
is 
being 
restored 
in
it. 
Your 
fellow 
countrymen<p>
are 
emerging 
boldly 
from 
their 
hiding 
places
on 
<a href="/cZl/UxO3Ro1gAhL8SC.html">finding</a> 
that 
they 
are 
respected. 
Any 
violence 
to 
them 
or 
to 
their
property 
is 
promptly 
punished. 
His 
Majesty 
the 
Emperor 
and 
King 
protects
them, 
and 
considers 
no 
one 
among 
you 
his 
enemy 
except 
those 
who 
disobey
his 
orders. 
He 
desires 
to 
end 
your 
misfortunes 
and 
restore 
you 
to 
your
homes 
and 
families. 
Respond, 
therefore, 
to 
his 
benevolent 
intentions
and 
come 
to 
us 
without 
fear. 
Inhabitants, 
return 
with 
confidence 
to 
your
abodes! 
You 
will 
soon 
find 
means 
of 
satisfying 
your 
needs. 
Craftsmen
and 
industrious<p>
artisans, 
return 
to 
your 
work, 
your 
houses, 
your 
shops,
where 
the 
protection 
of 
guards 
awaits 
you! 
You 
shall 
receive 
proper 
pay
for 
your 
work. 
And 
lastly 
you 
too, 
peasants, 
come 
from 
the 
<a href="/cZl/aK7RPI6Nz2UKBi.html">forests</a> 
where
you 
are 
hiding 
in 
terror, 
return 
to 
your 
huts 
without 
fear, 
in 
full
assurance 
that 
you 
will 
find 
protection! 
Markets 
are 
established 
in 
the
city 
where 
peasants 
can 
bring 
their 
surplus 
supplies 
and 
the 
products 
of
the 
soil. 
The 
government 
has 
taken 
the 
following 
steps 
to 
ensure 
freedom
of 
sale 
for 
them: 
(1) 
From 
today, 
peasants, 
husbandmen, 
and 
those
living 
in 
the 
neighborhood 
of 
Moscow 
may 
without<p>
any 
danger 
bring 
their
supplies 
of 
all 
kinds<p>
to 
two 
appointed 
markets, 
of 
which 
one 
is 
on
the 
Mokhovaya 
Street 
and 
the 
other 
at 
the 
Provision 
Market. 
(2) 
Such
supplies 
will 
be 
bought 
from 
them 
at 
such 
prices 
as 
seller 
and 
buyer<p>
may
agree 
on, 
and 
if 
a 
seller 
is 
unable 
to 
obtain 
a 
fair 
price 
he 
will 
be
free 
to 
take 
his 
goods 
back 
to 
his 
village 
and 
no 
one 
may 
hinder 
him
under 
any 
pretense.
