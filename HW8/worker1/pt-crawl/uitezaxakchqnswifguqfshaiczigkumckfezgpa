be 
blindfolded 
like 
the</h1>others, 
and 
like 
a 
wounded
animal 
looked 
around 
him 
with 
glittering 
eyes.

Pierre 
was 
no 
longer 
able 
to 
turn 
away 
and 
close<p>
his 
eyes. 
His 
curiosity
and 
agitation, 
like 
that 
of 
the 
whole 
crowd, 
reached 
the 
highest 
pitch
at 
this 
fifth 
murder.<p>
Like 
the 
others 
this 
fifth 
man 
seemed 
calm;<p>
he
wrapped 
his 
loose 
cloak 
closer 
and 
rubbed 
one 
bare 
foot 
with 
the 
other.

When 
they 
began 
to 
blindfold 
him 
he 
himself 
adjusted 
the 
knot 
which
hurt 
the 
back 
of 
his 
head; 
then 
when 
they 
propped 
him 
against 
the
bloodstained 
post, 
he 
leaned 
back 
and, 
not 
being 
comfortable 
in 
that
position, 
straightened 
himself, 
adjusted 
his<p>
feet, 
and 
leaned 
back 
again
more 
comfortably. 
Pierre 
did 
not 
take 
his 
eyes 
from 
him 
and 
did 
not 
miss
his 
slightest 
movement.

Probably 
a 
word 
of 
command 
was 
given 
and 
was 
followed 
by<p>
the 
reports 
of
eight 
muskets; 
but 
try 
as 
he 
would 
Pierre 
could 
not 
afterwards 
remember
having 
heard 
the 
slightest 
sound 
of 
the 
shots. 
He 
only 
saw 
how 
the
workman 
suddenly 
sank 
down 
on 
the 
cords 
that 
held 
him, 
how 
blood 
showed
itself 
in 
two 
places, 
how 
the 
ropes 
slackened 
under 
the 
weight 
of 
the
hanging 
body, 
and 
how 
the 
workman 
sat 
down, 
his 
head 
hanging 
unnaturally
and 
one 
leg 
bent 
under 
him. 
Pierre 
ran 
up 
to 
the 
post. 
No 
one 
hindered
him. 
Pale, 
frightened 
people 
were 
doing 
something 
around 
the 
workman.
The 
lower 
jaw 
of 
an 
old 
Frenchman 
with 
a 
thick 
mustache 
trembled 
as 
he
untied 
the 
ropes. 
The 
body 
collapsed. 
The 
soldiers 
dragged 
it 
awkwardly
from 
the 
post 
and 
began 
pushing 
it 
into 
the 
pit.

They 
all 
plainly 
and 
certainly 
knew 
that 
they 
were 
criminals 
who 
must
hide 
the 
traces 
of 
their 
guilt 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible.

Pierre 
glanced 
into 
the 
pit 
and 
saw 
that 
the 
factory 
lad 
was 
lying 
with
his 
knees 
close 
up 
to 
his 
head 
and 
one 
shoulder 
higher 
than 
the 
other.
That 
shoulder 
rose 
and 
fell 
rhythmically 
and 
convulsively, 
but 
spadefuls
of 
earth 
were 
already 
being 
thrown 
over 
the 
whole 
body. 
One 
of 
the
soldiers, 
evidently 
suffering, 
shouted 
gruffly 
and 
angrily 
at 
Pierre 
to
go 
back. 
But 
Pierre 
did 
not 
understand 
him 
and 
remained 
near 
the 
post,
and 
no 
one 
drove 
him 
away.

When 
the 
pit 
had 
been 
filled 
up 
a 
command 
was 
given. 
Pierre 
was 
taken
back 
to 
his 
place, 
and 
the 
rows 
of 
troops 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
the 
post
made 
a 
half 
turn 
and 
went 
past 
it 
at 
a 
measured 
pace. 
The 
twenty-four
sharpshooters 
with 
discharged 
muskets, 
standing 
in 
the 
center 
of 
the
circle, 
ran 
back 
to 
their 
places 
as 
the 
companies 
passed 
by.

Pierre 
gazed 
now 
with 
dazed 
eyes 
at 
these 
sharpshooters 
who 
ran 
in
couples 
out 
of 
the 
circle. 
All 
but 
one 
rejoined 
their 
companies. 
This
one, 
a 
young 
soldier, 
his 
face 
deadly<p>
pale, 
his 
shako 
pushed 
back, 
and
his 
musket 
resting 
on 
the 
ground, 
still 
stood 
near 
the 
pit 
at 
the 
spot
from 
which 
he 
had 
fired.
