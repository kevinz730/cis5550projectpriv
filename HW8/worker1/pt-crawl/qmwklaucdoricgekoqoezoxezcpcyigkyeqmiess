song.

As 
if 
responding 
to 
them 
but 
with 
a 
different 
sort 
of 
merriment, 
the
metallic 
sound 
of 
the 
bells 
reverberated 
high 
above 
and 
the 
hot 
rays 
of
the 
sun 
bathed 
the 
top 
of 
the 
opposite 
slope 
with 
yet 
another 
sort 
of
merriment. 
But 
beneath 
the 
slope, 
by 
the 
cart 
with 
the 
wounded 
near 
the
panting 
little 
nag 
where 
Pierre 
stood, 
it 
was 
damp, 
somber, 
and 
sad.

The<p>
soldier 
with 
the 
swollen 
cheek 
<a href="/aVzUge/GF1Scb11n.html">looked</a> 
angrily 
at 
the 
<a href="/cZl/BP2XQ9XHd4N.html">cavalry
singers.

"Oh,</a> 
the 
coxcombs!" 
he 
muttered 
reproachfully.

"It's 
not 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hj4EJ6pWxqu9IgdEd.html">soldiers</a> 
only, 
but 
I've 
seen 
peasants 
today, 
too....
The 
peasants-even 
they 
have 
to 
go," 
said 
the 
soldier 
behind 
the 
cart,
addressing 
Pierre 
with 
a 
sad 
smile. 
"No 
distinctions 
made 
nowadays....
They 
want 
the 
whole 
nation 
to 
fall 
on 
them-in 
a 
word, 
it's 
Moscow! 
They
want 
to 
make 
an 
end 
of 
it."

In 
spite 
of 
the 
obscurity 
of 
the 
soldier's 
words 
Pierre 
understood 
what
he 
wanted 
to 
say 
and 
nodded 
approval.

The 
road 
was 
clear 
again; 
Pierre 
descended 
the 
hill 
and 
drove 
on.

He 
kept 
looking 
to 
either 
side 
of 
the 
road 
for 
familiar 
faces, 
but 
only
saw 
everywhere 
the 
unfamiliar 
faces 
of 
various 
military 
men 
of 
different
branches 
of 
the 
service, 
who 
all 
looked 
with 
astonishment 
at 
his 
white
hat 
and 
green 
tail 
coat.

Having 
gone 
nearly 
three 
miles 
he 
at 
last 
met 
an 
acquaintance 
and
eagerly<p>
addressed 
him. 
This 
was 
one 
of 
the 
head 
army 
doctors. 
He 
was
driving 
toward 
Pierre 
in 
a 
covered 
gig,
