the 
room 
where 
Khvostikov 
and<p>
Makarin</h1>were 
sitting.

Anatole 
lay 
on 
the 
sofa 
in 
the 
study 
leaning 
on 
his 
elbow 
and 
smiling
pensively, 
while 
his 
handsome 
lips 
muttered 
tenderly 
to 
himself.

"Come 
and 
eat 
something. 
Have 
a 
drink!" 
Dolokhov 
shouted 
to 
him
from 
the 
other 
room.

"I 
don't 
want 
to," 
answered 
Anatole 
continuing 
to 
smile.

"Come! 
Balaga 
is 
here."

Anatole 
rose 
and 
went 
into 
the 
dining 
room. 
Balaga 
was 
a 
famous 
troyka
driver 
who 
had 
known 
Dolokhov 
and 
Anatole 
some 
six 
years 
and 
had 
given
them 
good 
service 
with 
his 
troykas. 
More 
than 
once 
when 
Anatole's
regiment 
was 
stationed 
at 
Tver 
he 
had 
taken 
him 
from 
Tver 
in 
the
evening, 
brought 
him 
to 
Moscow 
by 
daybreak, 
and 
driven 
him 
back 
again
the 
next 
night. 
More 
than 
once 
he 
had 
enabled 
Dolokhov 
to 
escape 
when
pursued. 
More 
than 
once 
he 
had 
driven 
them 
through 
the<p>
town 
with 
gypsies
and 
"ladykins" 
as 
he 
called 
the 
cocottes. 
More 
than 
once 
in 
their
service 
he 
had 
run 
over 
pedestrians 
and 
upset 
vehicles 
in 
the 
streets
of 
Moscow 
and 
had 
always 
been 
protected 
from 
the 
consequences 
by 
"my
gentlemen" 
as 
he 
called 
them. 
He 
had 
ruined 
more 
than 
one 
horse 
in
their 
service. 
More 
than 
once 
they 
had 
beaten 
him, 
and 
more 
than 
once
they 
had 
made 
him 
drunk 
on 
champagne 
and 
Madeira, 
which 
he 
loved; 
and
he 
knew 
more 
than 
one 
thing 
about 
each 
of 
them 
which 
would 
long 
ago 
have
sent 
an 
ordinary 
man 
to 
Siberia. 
They 
often 
called 
Balaga 
into 
their
orgies 
and 
made 
him 
drink 
and 
dance 
at 
the 
gypsies', 
and 
more 
than 
one
thousand 
rubles 
of 
their 
money 
had 
passed 
through 
his 
hands. 
In 
their
service 
he 
risked 
his 
skin 
and 
his 
life 
twenty 
times 
a 
year, 
and 
in
their 
service 
had 
lost 
more 
horses 
than 
the 
money 
he 
had 
from 
them 
would
buy. 
But<p>
he 
liked 
them; 
liked 
that 
mad 
driving 
at 
twelve 
miles 
an 
hour,
liked 
upsetting 
a 
driver 
or 
running 
down 
a 
pedestrian, 
and 
flying 
at
full 
gallop 
through 
the 
Moscow 
streets. 
He 
liked 
to 
hear 
those 
wild,
tipsy 
shouts 
behind 
him: 
"Get 
on! 
Get 
on!" 
when 
it 
was 
impossible
to 
go 
any 
faster. 
He 
liked 
giving 
a 
painful 
lash 
on 
the 
neck 
to 
some
peasant 
who, 
more 
dead 
than 
alive, 
was 
already 
hurrying 
out 
of 
his 
way.
"Real 
gentlemen!" 
he 
considered 
them.

Anatole 
and 
Dolokhov 
liked 
Balaga 
too<p>
for 
his 
masterly 
driving 
and
because 
he 
liked 
the 
things 
they 
liked. 
With 
others 
Balaga 
bargained,
charging 
twenty-five 
rubles 
for 
a 
two 
hours' 
drive, 
and 
rarely
drove 
himself, 
generally 
letting 
his 
young 
men 
do 
so. 
But 
with 
"his
gentlemen" 
he 
always 
drove 
himself 
and 
never 
demanded 
anything 
for
his 
work. 
Only 
a 
couple 
of 
times 
a 
year-when 
he 
knew 
from 
their 
valets
that 
they 
had 
money 
in 
hand-he 
would 
turn 
up 
of 
a 
morning 
quite 
sober
and 
with 
a 
deep 
bow 
would 
ask 
them 
to 
help 
him. 
The 
gentlemen 
always
made 
him 
sit 
down.

"Do 
help 
me 
out, 
Theodore 
Ivanych, 
sir," 
or 
"your 
excellency,"
he 
would 
say. 
"I 
am 
quite<p>
out 
of 
horses. 
Let 
me 
have 
what 
you 
can 
to
go 
to 
the 
fair."

And 
Anatole 
and 
Dolokhov, 
when 
they 
had 
money, 
would 
give 
him 
a
thousand 
or<p>
a 
couple 
of 
thousand 
rubles.

Balaga 
was 
a 
fair-haired, 
short, 
and 
snub-nosed 
peasant 
of 
about
twenty-seven; 
red-faced, 
with 
a 
particularly 
red 
thick 
neck, 
glittering
little 
eyes, 
and 
a 
small 
beard. 
He 
wore 
a 
fine, 
dark-blue, 
silk-lined
cloth 
coat 
over 
a 
sheepskin.
