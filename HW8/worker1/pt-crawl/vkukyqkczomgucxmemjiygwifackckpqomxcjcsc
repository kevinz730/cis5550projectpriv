Julie 
played 
most</h1>doleful 
nocturnes 
on 
her 
harp. 
Boris
read 
Poor 
Liza 
aloud 
to 
her, 
and 
more 
than 
once 
interrupted 
the 
reading
because 
of 
the 
emotions 
that 
choked 
him. 
Meeting 
at 
large 
gatherings
Julie 
and 
Boris 
looked 
on 
one 
another 
as 
the 
only 
souls 
who<p>
understood
one 
another<p>
in 
a 
world 
of 
indifferent 
people.

Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
who 
often 
visited 
the 
Karagins, 
while 
playing 
cards
with 
the 
mother 
made 
careful 
inquiries 
as 
to 
Julie's 
dowry 
(she 
was
to 
have 
two 
estates 
in 
Penza 
and 
the 
<a href="/cZl/lg7mk5rqw7Yg.html">Nizhegorod</a> 
forests). 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
regarded 
the 
refined 
sadness 
that 
united 
her 
son 
to 
the
wealthy 
Julie 
with 
emotion, 
and 
resignation 
to 
the 
Divine 
will.

"You 
are 
always 
charming 
and 
melancholy, 
my 
dear 
Julie," 
she 
said 
to
the 
daughter. 
"Boris 
says 
his 
soul 
finds 
repose 
at 
your 
house. 
He 
has
suffered 
so 
many 
disappointments 
and 
is 
so 
sensitive," 
said 
she 
to
the 
mother. 
"Ah, 
my 
dear, 
I 
can't 
tell 
you 
how 
fond 
I 
have 
grown
of 
Julie 
latterly," 
she 
said 
to 
her 
son. 
"But 
who 
could 
help 
loving
her? 
She 
is 
an 
angelic 
being! 
Ah, 
Boris, 
Boris!"-she 
paused.
"And 
how 
I 
pity 
her 
mother," 
she 
went 
on; 
"today 
she 
showed 
me 
her
accounts 
and 
letters 
from 
Penza 
(they 
have 
enormous 
estates 
there), 
and
she, 
poor 
thing, 
has 
no 
one 
to 
help 
her, 
and 
they 
do 
cheat 
her 
so!"

Boris 
smiled 
almost 
imperceptibly 
while 
listening 
to 
his 
mother. 
He
laughed 
blandly 
at 
her 
naive 
diplomacy 
but 
listened 
to 
what 
she 
had
to 
say, 
and 
sometimes 
questioned 
her 
carefully 
about 
the 
Penza 
and
Nizhegorod 
estates.

Julie 
had 
long 
been 
expecting 
a 
proposal 
from 
her 
melancholy 
adorer 
and
was 
ready 
to 
accept 
it; 
but 
some 
secret 
feeling 
of 
repulsion 
for 
her,
for 
her 
passionate 
desire 
to 
get 
married, 
for 
her 
artificiality, 
and
a 
feeling 
of 
horror 
at 
renouncing 
the 
possibility 
of 
real<p>
love 
still
restrained 
Boris. 
His 
leave 
was 
expiring. 
He 
spent 
every 
day 
and 
whole
days 
at 
the 
Karagins', 
and 
every 
day 
on 
thinking 
the 
matter 
over
told 
himself 
that 
he 
would 
propose 
tomorrow. 
But 
in 
Julie's 
presence,
looking 
at 
her 
red 
face 
and 
chin 
(nearly 
always 
powdered), 
her<p>
moist
eyes, 
and 
her 
expression 
of 
continual 
readiness 
to 
pass 
at 
once 
from
melancholy 
to 
an 
unnatural 
rapture 
of 
married 
bliss, 
Boris 
could 
not
utter 
the 
decisive 
words, 
though 
in 
imagination 
he 
had 
long 
regarded
himself 
as 
the 
possessor 
of 
those 
Penza 
and 
Nizhegorod 
estates 
and
had 
apportioned 
the 
use 
of 
the 
income 
from 
them. 
Julie 
saw 
Boris'
indecision, 
and 
sometimes 
the 
thought 
occurred 
to 
her 
that 
she 
was
repulsive 
to 
him, 
but 
her 
feminine 
self-deception 
immediately 
<a href="/cZl/aK9AgW7Uo9.html">supplied
her</a> 
with 
consolation, 
and 
she 
told 
herself 
that 
he 
was 
only 
shy 
from
love. 
Her 
melancholy, 
however, 
began 
to 
turn 
to 
irritability, 
and 
not
long 
before 
Boris' 
departure 
she 
formed 
a 
definite 
plan 
of 
action.
Just 
as 
Boris' 
leave 
of 
absence 
was 
expiring, 
Anatole 
Kuragin 
made
his 
appearance 
in 
Moscow, 
and 
of 
course 
in 
the 
Karagins' 
drawing
room, 
and 
Julie, 
suddenly 
abandoning 
her 
melancholy, 
became 
cheerful 
and
very 
attentive 
to 
Kuragin.

"My 
dear," 
said 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
to 
her 
son, 
"I 
know 
from 
a
reliable 
source 
that 
Prince 
Vasili 
has 
sent 
his 
son 
to 
Moscow 
to 
get
him 
married 
to 
Julie. 
I<p>
am 
so 
fond 
of 
Julie 
that 
I 
should 
be 
sorry 
<a href="/aVzUge/yf2RPI5oL5trTR.html">for
her.</a> 
What 
do 
you 
think 
of 
it, 
my 
dear?"

The 
idea 
of 
being 
made 
a 
fool 
of 
and 
of 
having 
thrown 
away 
that 
whole
month 
of 
arduous 
melancholy 
service 
to 
Julie, 
and 
of 
seeing 
all
the 
revenue 
from 
the 
Penza 
estates 
which 
he 
had 
already 
mentally
apportioned 
and 
put 
to 
proper 
use 
fall 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
another, 
and
especially 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
that 
idiot 
Anatole, 
pained 
Boris. 
He 
drove
to 
the 
Karagins' 
with 
the 
firm 
intention 
of 
proposing. 
Julie 
met
him 
in 
a 
gay, 
careless 
manner, 
spoke 
casually 
of 
how 
she 
had 
enjoyed
yesterday's 
ball, 
and 
asked 
when 
he 
was 
leaving. 
Though 
Boris 
had
come 
intentionally 
to 
speak 
of 
his 
love 
and
