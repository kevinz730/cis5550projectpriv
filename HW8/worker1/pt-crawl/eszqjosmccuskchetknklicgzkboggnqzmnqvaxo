"Good 
God, 
what 
simplicity!"


Nesvitski 
with 
a 
laugh<p>
threw 
his 
arms 
round 
Prince 
Andrew, 
but
Bolkonski, 
turning 
still 
paler, 
pushed 
him 
away 
with 
an 
angry 
look 
and
turned 
to 
Zherkov. 
The 
nervous 
irritation 
aroused 
by 
the 
appearance
of 
Mack, 
the 
news 
of 
his 
defeat, 
and 
the 
thought 
of 
what 
lay 
before 
the
Russian 
army 
found 
vent 
in 
anger 
at 
Zherkov's 
untimely 
jest.

"If 
you, 
sir, 
choose 
to 
make 
a 
buffoon 
of 
yourself," 
he 
said
sharply, 
with 
a 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ce16rq6TtfY.html">slight</a> 
trembling 
of 
the 
lower 
<a href="/cZl/hMv6Ook38xXmhq.html">jaw,</a> 
"I 
can't 
prevent
your 
doing 
so; 
but 
I<p>
<a href="/cZl/oUZ2hOZs4V9TSU.html">warn</a> 
you 
that 
if 
you 
dare 
to 
play 
the 
fool 
in 
my
presence, 
I 
will 
teach 
you 
to 
behave 
yourself."

Nesvitski 
and 
Zherkov 
were 
so 
surprised 
by 
this 
outburst 
that<p>
they
gazed 
at 
Bolkonski 
silently 
with 
wide-open 
eyes.

"What's 
the 
matter? 
I 
only 
congratulated 
them," 
said 
Zherkov.

"I 
am 
not 
jesting 
with 
you; 
please 
be 
silent!" 
cried 
Bolkonski,
and 
taking 
Nesvitski's 
arm 
he 
left 
Zherkov, 
who 
did 
not 
know 
what 
to
say.

"Come, 
what's 
the 
matter, 
old 
fellow?" 
said 
Nesvitski 
trying 
to
soothe 
him.

"What's 
the 
matter?" 
exclaimed 
Prince 
Andrew 
standing<p>
still 
in
his 
excitement. 
"Don't 
you 
understand 
that 
either 
we 
are 
officers
serving 
our 
Tsar 
and 
our 
country, 
rejoicing 
in 
the 
successes 
and
grieving 
at 
the 
misfortunes 
of 
our 
common 
cause, 
or 
we 
are 
merely
lackeys 
who 
care 
nothing 
for 
their 
master's 
business.

he 
said, 
as 
if 
strengthening 
his
views 
by 
this 
French 
sentence. 
"C'est

word

accent-having<p>

that
