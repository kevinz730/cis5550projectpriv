and 
how 
she,</h1>taking
some 
dried 
bread 
with 
her, 
had 
spent 
two 
days 
in 
the 
catacombs 
with
the 
saints. 
"I'd 
pray 
awhile 
to 
one, 
ponder 
awhile, 
then 
go 
on 
to
another. 
I'd 
sleep 
a 
bit 
and 
then 
again 
go<p>
and 
kiss 
the 
relics, 
and
there 
was 
such 
peace 
all 
around, 
such 
blessedness, 
that 
one 
don't 
want
to 
come 
out, 
even 
into 
the 
light 
of 
heaven 
again."

Pierre 
listened 
to 
her 
attentively 
and 
seriously. 
Prince 
Andrew 
went 
out
of 
the 
room, 
and 
then, 
leaving 
"God's 
folk" 
to 
finish 
their 
tea,
Princess 
Mary<p>
took 
Pierre 
into 
the 
drawing 
room.

"You 
are 
very 
kind," 
she 
said 
to 
him.

"Oh, 
I 
really 
did 
not 
mean 
to 
hurt 
her 
<a href="/cZl/Lg4mbmX92JyP.html">feelings.</a> 
I 
understand 
them 
so
well 
and 
have 
the 
greatest 
respect 
for 
them."

Princess 
Mary 
looked 
at 
him 
silently 
and 
smiled 
affectionately.

"I 
have 
known 
you 
a 
long 
time, 
you 
see, 
and 
am 
as 
fond 
of 
you 
as 
of 
a
brother," 
she 
said. 
"How 
do 
you 
find 
Andrew?" 
she 
added 
hurriedly,
not 
giving 
him 
time 
to 
reply 
to 
her 
affectionate 
words. 
"I 
am 
very
anxious 
about 
him. 
His 
health 
was 
better 
in 
the 
winter, 
but 
last 
spring
his 
wound 
reopened 
and 
the 
doctor 
said 
he 
ought 
to 
go 
away 
for 
a
cure. 
And 
I 
am 
also 
very 
much 
afraid 
for 
him 
spiritually. 
He 
has 
not 
a
character 
like 
us 
women 
who, 
when 
we 
suffer, 
can 
weep 
away 
our 
sorrows.
He 
keeps 
it 
all 
within 
him. 
Today 
he 
is 
cheerful 
and 
in 
good 
spirits,
but 
that 
is 
the 
effect 
of 
your 
visit-he 
is 
not 
often 
like 
that. 
If
you 
could 
persuade 
him 
to 
go 
abroad. 
He 
needs 
activity, 
and 
this 
quiet
regular 
life 
is 
very 
bad 
for 
him. 
Others 
don't 
notice 
it, 
but 
I 
see
it."

Toward 
ten 
o'clock 
the 
men 
servants 
rushed 
to 
the 
front 
door, 
hearing
the 
bells 
of 
the 
old 
prince's 
carriage 
approaching. 
Prince 
Andrew 
and
Pierre 
also 
went 
out 
into 
the 
porch.

"Who's 
that?" 
asked 
the 
old 
prince, 
noticing 
Pierre 
as 
he<p>
got 
out
of 
the 
carriage.

"Ah! 
Very 
glad! 
Kiss 
me," 
he 
said, 
having 
learned 
who 
the 
young
stranger 
was.

The 
old 
prince 
was 
in 
a 
good 
temper 
and 
very 
gracious 
to 
Pierre.

Before 
supper, 
Prince 
Andrew, 
coming 
back 
to 
his 
father's 
study, 
found
him 
disputing 
hotly 
with 
his 
visitor. 
Pierre 
was 
maintaining 
that 
a 
time
would 
come 
when 
there 
would 
be 
no 
more 
wars. 
The 
old 
prince 
disputed 
it
chaffingly, 
but 
without 
getting 
angry.

"Drain 
<a href="/cZl/aK9AgW7Uo9.html">the</a> 
blood 
from 
men's 
veins 
and 
put 
in 
water 
instead, 
then
there 
will 
be 
no 
more 
war! 
Old 
women's 
nonsense-old 
women's
nonsense!" 
he 
repeated, 
but 
still 
he 
patted 
Pierre 
affectionately
on 
the 
shoulder, 
and 
then 
went 
up 
to 
the 
table 
where 
Prince 
Andrew,
evidently 
not 
wishing 
to 
join 
in 
the 
conversation, 
was 
looking 
over 
<a href="/cZl/dA2tQI5SC4.html">the
papers</a> 
his 
father 
had 
brought 
from 
town. 
The 
old<p>
prince 
went 
up 
to 
him
and 
began 
to 
talk 
business.

"The 
marshal, 
a 
Count 
Rostov, 
hasn't 
sent 
half 
his 
contingent. 
He
came 
to 
town 
and 
wanted 
to 
invite 
me 
to 
dinner-I 
gave 
him 
a 
pretty
dinner!... 
And 
there, 
look 
at 
this.... 
Well, 
my 
boy,"
