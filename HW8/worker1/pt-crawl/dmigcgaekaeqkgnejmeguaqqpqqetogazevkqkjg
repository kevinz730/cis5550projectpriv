dwive 
them 
off."

"Attack 
indeed!"</h1>said 
the 
colonel 
in 
a 
bored 
voice, 
puckering 
up 
his
face 
as 
if 
driving 
off 
a 
troublesome 
fly. 
"And 
why 
are 
you 
stopping
here? 
Don't 
you 
see 
the 
skirmishers 
are 
retreating? 
Lead 
the 
squadron
back."

The<p>
squadron 
crossed 
the 
bridge 
and 
drew 
out 
of 
range<p>
of 
fire 
without
having 
lost 
a 
single 
man. 
The 
second 
squadron 
that 
had 
been 
in 
the 
front
line 
followed 
them 
across 
and 
the 
last 
Cossacks 
quitted 
the 
farther 
side
of 
the 
river.

The 
two 
Pavlograd 
squadrons, 
having 
crossed 
the 
bridge, 
retired 
up 
the
hill 
one 
after 
the 
other. 
Their 
colonel, 
Karl 
Bogdanich 
Schubert, 
came
up 
to 
Denisov's 
squadron 
and 
rode 
at 
a 
footpace 
not 
far 
from 
Rostov,
without 
taking 
any 
notice 
of 
him 
although 
they 
were 
now 
meeting 
for 
the
first 
time 
since 
their 
encounter 
concerning 
Telyanin. 
Rostov, 
feeling
that 
he 
was 
at 
the 
front 
and 
in 
the 
power 
of 
a 
man 
toward 
whom 
he 
now
admitted 
that 
he 
had 
been 
to 
blame, 
did 
not 
lift 
his 
eyes 
from 
the
colonel's 
athletic 
back, 
his 
nape 
covered 
with 
light 
hair, 
and 
his 
red
neck. 
It 
seemed 
to 
Rostov 
that 
Bogdanich 
was 
only 
pretending 
not
to 
notice 
him, 
and 
that 
his 
whole 
aim 
now 
was 
to 
test 
the 
cadet's
courage, 
so 
he 
drew 
himself 
up 
and 
looked 
around 
him 
merrily; 
then 
it
seemed 
to 
him 
that 
Bogdanich 
rode 
so 
near 
in 
order 
to 
show 
him<p>
his
courage. 
Next 
he 
thought 
that 
his 
enemy 
would 
send 
the 
squadron 
on 
a
desperate 
attack 
just 
to 
punish 
him-Rostov. 
Then 
he 
imagined 
how,
after 
the 
attack, 
Bogdanich 
would 
come 
up 
to 
him 
as 
he 
lay 
wounded 
and
would 
magnanimously 
extend 
the 
hand 
of 
reconciliation.

The 
high-shouldered 
figure 
of 
Zherkov, 
familiar 
to 
the 
Pavlograds 
as
he 
had 
but 
recently 
left 
their 
regiment, 
rode 
up 
to 
the 
colonel.
After 
his 
dismissal 
from 
headquarters 
Zherkov 
had 
not 
remained 
in 
the
regiment, 
saying 
he 
was 
not 
such 
a 
fool 
as 
to 
slave 
at 
the 
front 
when 
he
could 
get 
more 
rewards 
by 
doing 
nothing 
on 
the 
staff, 
and 
had 
succeeded
in 
attaching 
himself 
as 
an 
orderly 
officer 
to 
Prince 
Bagration. 
He 
now
came 
to 
his 
former 
chief<p>
with 
an 
order 
from 
the 
commander 
of 
the 
rear
guard.

"Colonel,"<p>
he 
said, 
addressing 
Rostov's 
enemy 
with 
an 
air 
of
gloomy 
gravity 
and 
glancing 
round 
at 
his 
comrades, 
"there 
is 
an 
order
to 
stop 
and 
fire 
the 
bridge."

"An 
order 
to 
who?" 
asked 
the 
colonel 
morosely.

"I 
don't 
myself 
know 
'to 
who,'" 
replied 
the 
cornet 
in 
a
serious 
tone, 
"but 
the 
prince 
told 
me 
to 
'go 
and 
tell 
the 
colonel
that 
the 
hussars 
must 
return 
quickly 
and 
fire 
the 
bridge.'"

Zherkov 
was 
followed 
by 
an 
officer 
of 
the 
suite 
who 
rode 
up 
to 
the
colonel 
of 
hussars 
with 
the 
same 
order. 
After 
him 
the 
stout 
Nesvitski
came 
galloping 
up 
on 
a 
Cossack 
horse 
that 
could 
scarcely 
carry 
his
weight.

"How's 
this, 
Colonel?" 
he 
shouted 
as 
he 
approached. 
"I 
told 
you
to 
fire 
the 
bridge, 
and 
now 
someone 
has 
gone 
and 
blundered; 
they 
are 
all
beside 
themselves 
over 
there 
and 
one 
can't 
make 
anything 
out."

The 
colonel 
deliberately 
stopped 
the 
regiment 
and 
turned 
to 
Nesvitski.

"You 
spoke 
to 
me 
of 
inflammable 
material," 
said 
he, 
"but 
you 
said
nothing 
about 
firing 
it."

"But, 
my 
dear 
sir," 
said 
Nesvitski 
as 
he 
drew 
up, 
taking 
off 
his
cap 
and 
smoothing 
his 
hair 
wet 
with 
perspiration 
with 
his 
plump 
hand,
"wasn't 
I 
telling 
you 
to 
fire 
the 
bridge, 
when 
inflammable 
material
had 
been
