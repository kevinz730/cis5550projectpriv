Andrew 
did 
not 
tell 
his<p>
father 
that 
he 
would 
no 
doubt 
live 
a 
long 
time
yet. 
He 
felt 
that 
he 
must 
not 
say 
it.

"I 
will 
do 
it 
all, 
Father," 
he 
said.

"Well, 
now, 
good-by!" 
He 
gave 
his 
son 
his 
hand 
to 
kiss, 
and 
embraced
him. 
"Remember 
this, 
Prince 
Andrew, 
if 
they 
kill 
you 
it 
will 
hurt 
me,
your 
old 
father..." 
he 
paused 
unexpectedly, 
and 
then 
in 
a 
querulous
voice 
suddenly 
shrieked: 
"but 
if 
I 
hear 
that 
you 
have 
not 
behaved 
like
a 
son 
of 
Nicholas 
Bolkonski, 
I 
shall 
be 
ashamed!"

"You 
need 
not 
have 
said 
that 
to 
me, 
Father," 
said 
the 
son 
with 
a
smile.

The 
old 
man 
was 
silent.

"I 
also 
wanted 
to 
ask 
you," 
continued 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"if 
I'm
killed 
and 
if 
I 
have 
a 
son, 
do 
not 
let 
him 
be 
taken 
away 
from 
you-as
