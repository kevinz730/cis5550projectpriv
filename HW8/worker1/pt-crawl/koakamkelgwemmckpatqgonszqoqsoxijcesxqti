He 
looked 
at 
Prince 
Vasili
in 
perplexity, 
and 
only 
later 
grasped 
that 
a 
stroke 
was 
an 
attack 
of
illness. 
Prince 
Vasili 
said 
something 
to 
Lorrain 
in 
passing 
and 
went
through 
the 
door 
on 
tiptoe. 
He 
could 
not 
walk 
well 
on 
tiptoe 
and 
his
whole 
body 
jerked 
at 
each 
step. 
The 
eldest 
princess 
followed 
him, 
and
the 
priests 
and 
deacons 
and 
some 
servants 
also 
went 
in 
at 
the 
door.
Through 
that 
door 
was 
heard 
a 
noise 
of 
things 
being 
moved 
about, 
and
at 
last 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
still 
with 
the 
same 
expression, 
pale 
but
resolute 
in 
the 
discharge 
of 
duty, 
ran 
out 
and 
touching 
Pierre 
lightly
on 
the 
arm 
said:

"The 
divine 
mercy 
is 
inexhaustible! 
Unction 
is 
about 
to 
be
administered. 
Come."

Pierre 
went 
in 
at 
the 
door, 
stepping 
on 
the 
soft 
carpet, 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/yf6bUI90.html">noticed
that</a> 
the 
strange 
lady, 
the 
aide-de-camp, 
and 
some 
of 
the 
servants, 
all
followed 
him 
in, 
as 
if 
there 
were 
now 
no 
further 
need 
for 
permission 
to
enter 
that

CHAPTER 
XXIII

Pierre 
well 
knew 
this 
large 
room 
divided 
by 
columns 
and 
an 
arch, 
its
walls 
hung 
round 
with 
Persian 
carpets. 
The 
part 
of 
the 
room 
behind 
the
columns, 
with 
a 
high 
silk-curtained 
mahogany 
bedstead 
on 
one 
side 
and
on 
the 
other 
an 
immense 
case 
containing 
icons, 
was 
brightly 
illuminated
with 
red 
light 
like 
a 
Russian 
church 
during 
evening 
service. 
Under
the 
gleaming 
icons 
stood 
a 
long 
invalid 
chair, 
and 
in 
that 
chair
on 
snowy-white 
smooth 
pillows, 
evidently 
freshly 
changed, 
Pierre
saw-covered 
to 
the 
waist 
by 
a 
bright 
green 
quilt-the 
familiar,
majestic 
figure 
of 
his 
father, 
Count 
Bezukhov, 
with 
that 
gray 
mane 
of
hair 
above 
his<p>
broad 
forehead 
which 
reminded 
one 
of 
a 
lion, 
and 
the 
deep
characteristically 
noble 
wrinkles 
of 
his 
handsome, 
ruddy 
face. 
He 
lay
just 
under 
the 
icons; 
his 
large 
thick 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZV5hW0bZDWZ8GFXfk.html">hands</a> 
outside 
the 
quilt. 
Into 
the
right 
hand, 
which 
was 
lying 
palm 
downwards,
