day</h1>before, 
namely, 
that 
the 
commander 
in 
chief
wished 
to<p>
see 
the 
regiment 
just 
in 
the 
state 
in 
which 
it 
had 
been 
on
the 
march: 
in 
their 
greatcoats, 
and 
packs, 
and 
without 
any 
preparation
whatever.

A 
member 
of 
the 
Hofkriegsrath 
from 
Vienna 
had 
come 
to 
Kutuzov 
the 
day
before 
with 
proposals 
and 
demands 
for 
him 
to 
join 
up 
with 
the 
army 
of
the 
Archduke 
Ferdinand 
and 
Mack, 
and 
Kutuzov, 
not 
considering 
this
junction 
advisable, 
meant, 
among 
other 
arguments 
in 
support 
of 
his 
view,
to 
show 
the<p>
Austrian 
general 
the 
wretched 
state 
in 
which 
the 
troops
arrived 
from 
Russia. 
With 
this 
object 
he 
intended 
to 
meet 
the 
regiment;
so 
the 
worse 
the 
condition 
it 
was 
in, 
the 
better 
pleased 
the 
commander
in 
chief 
would 
be. 
Though 
the 
aide-de-camp 
did 
not 
know 
these
circumstances, 
he 
nevertheless 
delivered 
the 
definite 
order 
that 
the
men 
should 
be 
in 
their 
greatcoats 
and 
in 
marching 
order, 
and 
that 
the
commander 
in 
chief 
would 
otherwise 
be 
dissatisfied. 
On 
hearing 
this 
the
regimental 
commander 
hung 
his 
head, 
silently 
shrugged 
his 
shoulders, 
and
spread 
out 
his 
arms 
with 
a 
choleric 
gesture.

"A 
fine 
mess 
we've 
made 
of 
it!"
