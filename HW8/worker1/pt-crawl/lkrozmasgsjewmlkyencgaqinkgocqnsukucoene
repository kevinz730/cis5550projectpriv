Russian. 
It 
is 
becoming 
dangerous 
to 
speak 
French 
in
the 
streets."

"And 
how 
about 
you, 
Count 
Peter 
Kirilych? 
If 
they 
call 
up 
the 
militia,
you 
too 
will 
have 
to 
mount 
a 
horse," 
remarked 
the 
old 
count, 
addressing
Pierre.

Pierre 
had 
been 
silent 
and 
preoccupied 
all 
through 
dinner, 
seeming 
not
to 
grasp 
what 
was 
said. 
He 
looked 
at 
the 
count.

"Oh 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/gA7R9YXnB0GBzwy.html">yes,</a> 
the 
war," 
he 
said. 
"No! 
What 
sort 
of 
warrior 
should 
I 
make? 
And
yet 
everything 
is 
so 
strange, 
so 
strange! 
I 
can't 
make 
it 
out. 
I 
don't
know, 
I 
am 
very 
far 
from 
having 
military 
tastes, 
but 
in 
these 
times 
no
one 
can 
answer 
for 
himself."

After 
dinner 
the 
count 
settled 
himself 
comfortably 
in 
an 
easy 
chair 
and
with 
a 
serious 
face 
asked 
Sonya, 
who 
was 
considered 
an 
excellent 
reader,
to 
read 
the 
appeal.

"To 
Moscow, 
our 
ancient 
Capital!

"The 
enemy 
has 
entered 
the 
borders 
of 
Russia 
with 
immense 
forces. 
He
comes 
to 
despoil 
our 
beloved 
country."

Sonya 
read 
painstakingly 
in 
her 
high-pitched 
voice. 
The 
count 
listened
with 
closed 
eyes, 
heaving 
abrupt 
sighs 
at 
certain 
passages.

Natasha 
sat 
erect, 
gazing 
with 
a 
searching 
look 
now 
at 
her 
father 
and
now 
at 
Pierre.

Pierre 
felt 
her 
eyes 
on<p>
him 
and 
tried 
not 
to 
look 
round. 
The 
countess
shook 
her 
head 
disapprovingly 
and 
angrily 
at 
every 
solemn 
expression
in 
the 
manifesto. 
In 
all 
these 
words 
she 
saw 
only 
that 
the 
danger
threatening 
her 
son 
would 
not 
soon 
be 
over. 
Shinshin, 
with 
a 
sarcastic
smile 
on 
his 
lips, 
was 
evidently 
preparing 
to 
make 
fun 
of 
anything 
that
gave 
him 
the 
opportunity: 
Sonya's 
reading, 
any 
remark 
of 
the 
count's, 
or
even 
the 
manifesto 
itself 
should 
no 
better 
pretext 
present 
itself.

After 
reading 
about 
the 
dangers 
that 
<a href="/cZl/VI2EVa2As5NSUp.html">threatened</a> 
Russia, 
the 
hopes 
the
Emperor 
placed 
on 
Moscow 
and 
especially 
on 
its 
<a href="/aVzUge/lX3eplAZ1Im2mGGRm.html">illustrious</a> 
nobility,
Sonya, 
with 
a 
quiver 
in 
her 
voice 
due 
chiefly 
to 
the 
attention 
that 
was
being 
paid 
to 
her, 
read 
the 
last 
words:

"We 
ourselves 
will 
not 
delay 
to 
appear 
among 
our 
people 
in 
that 
Capital
and 
in 
other 
parts 
of 
our 
realm 
for 
consultation, 
and 
for 
the 
direction
of 
all 
our 
levies, 
both 
those 
now 
barring 
the 
enemy's 
path 
and 
those
freshly 
formed 
to 
defeat 
him 
wherever 
he 
may 
appear. 
May 
the 
ruin 
he
hopes 
to 
bring 
upon 
us 
recoil 
on 
his 
own 
head, 
and 
may 
Europe 
delivered
from 
bondage 
glorify 
the 
name 
of 
Russia!"


"Yes, 
that's 
it!" 
cried 
the 
count, 
opening 
his 
moist 
eyes 
and 
sniffing
repeatedly, 
as 
if 
a 
strong 
vinaigrette 
had 
been 
held 
to 
his 
nose; 
and 
he
added, 
"Let 
the 
Emperor 
but 
say 
the 
word 
and 
we'll 
sacrifice 
everything
and 
begrudge 
nothing."

Before 
Shinshin 
had 
time 
to 
utter 
<a href="/aVzUge/zv4trTR8gK6mfcn.html">the</a> 
joke 
he 
was 
ready 
to 
make<p>

patriotism,
