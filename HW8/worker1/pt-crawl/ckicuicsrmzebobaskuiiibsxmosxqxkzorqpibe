calm
voice. 
There</h1>was 
a 
stir 
in 
the 
ranks 
of 
the 
soldiers 
and 
it 
was 
evident
that 
they 
were 
all 
hurrying-not 
as 
men 
hurry 
to 
do 
something 
they
understand, 
but 
as 
people 
hurry 
to 
finish<p>
a 
necessary 
but 
unpleasant 
and
incomprehensible 
task.

A 
French 
official 
wearing 
a 
scarf 
came 
up 
to 
the 
right 
of 
the 
row 
of
prisoners 
and 
read 
out 
the 
sentence 
in 
Russian 
and 
in 
French.

Then 
two 
pairs 
of 
Frenchmen 
approached 
the 
criminals 
and 
at 
the
officer's 
command 
took 
the 
two 
convicts 
who 
stood 
first 
in 
the 
row. 
The
convicts 
stopped 
when 
they 
reached 
the 
post 
and, 
while 
sacks 
were 
being
brought, 
looked 
dumbly 
around 
as 
a 
wounded 
beast 
looks 
at 
an 
approaching
huntsman. 
One 
crossed 
himself<p>
continually, 
the 
other 
scratched 
his 
back
and 
made 
a 
movement 
of 
the 
lips 
resembling 
a 
smile. 
With 
hurried 
hands
the 
soldiers 
blindfolded 
them, 
drawing 
the 
sacks 
over 
their 
heads, 
and
bound 
them 
to 
the 
post.

Twelve 
sharpshooters 
with 
muskets 
stepped 
out 
of 
the 
ranks 
with 
a 
firm
regular 
tread 
and 
halted 
eight 
paces 
from 
the 
post. 
Pierre 
turned 
away
to 
avoid 
seeing 
what 
was 
going 
to 
happen. 
Suddenly 
a 
crackling, 
rolling
noise 
was 
heard 
which 
seemed 
to 
him 
louder 
than 
the 
most 
terrific
thunder, 
and 
he 
looked 
round. 
There 
was 
some 
smoke, 
and 
the 
Frenchmen
were 
doing<p>
something 
near 
the 
pit, 
with 
pale 
faces 
and 
trembling 
hands.
Two 
more 
prisoners 
were 
led 
up. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
and 
with 
similar 
looks,
these 
two 
glanced 
vainly 
at 
the 
onlookers 
with 
only 
a 
silent 
appeal 
for
protection 
in<p>
their 
eyes, 
evidently 
unable 
to 
understand 
or 
believe
what 
was 
going 
to 
happen 
to 
them. 
They 
could 
not 
believe 
it 
because 
they
alone 
knew 
what 
their 
life 
meant 
to 
them, 
and 
so 
they 
neither 
understood
nor<p>
believed 
that 
it 
could 
be 
taken 
from 
them.

Again 
Pierre 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
look 
and 
again 
turned 
away; 
but 
again 
the
sound 
as 
of 
a 
frightful 
explosion 
struck 
his 
ear, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
moment
he 
saw 
smoke, 
blood, 
and 
the 
pale, 
scared 
faces 
of 
the 
Frenchmen 
who
were 
again 
doing 
something 
by 
the 
post, 
their 
trembling 
hands 
impeding
one 
another. 
Pierre, 
breathing 
heavily, 
looked 
around 
as 
if 
asking 
what
it 
meant. 
The 
same 
question 
was 
expressed 
in 
all<p>
the 
looks 
that 
met 
his.

On 
the 
faces 
of 
all 
the 
Russians 
and 
of 
the 
French 
soldiers 
and 
officers
without 
exception, 
he 
read 
the 
same 
dismay, 
horror, 
and 
conflict 
that
were 
in 
his 
own 
heart. 
"But 
who, 
after 
all, 
is 
doing 
this? 
They 
are 
all
suffering 
as 
I 
am. 
Who 
then 
is 
it? 
Who?" 
flashed 
for 
an 
instant 
through
his 
mind.

"Sharpshooters 
of 
the 
86th, 
forward!" 
shouted 
someone. 
The 
fifth
prisoner, 
the 
one 
next 
to 
Pierre, 
was 
led 
away-alone. 
Pierre 
did 
not
understand 
that 
he 
was 
saved, 
that 
he 
and 
the 
rest 
had 
been 
brought
there 
only 
to 
witness 
the<p>
execution.
