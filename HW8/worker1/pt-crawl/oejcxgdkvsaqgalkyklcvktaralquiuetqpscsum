firing, 
and 
he 
felt 
his 
heart 
palpitating 
as 
he 
rode
forward 
beside 
Schmidt 
with 
the 
bullets 
merrily

he 
experienced 
tenfold 
the 
joy 
of 
living, 
as 
he 
had 
not 
done 
since
childhood.

He 
woke 
up...

"Yes,

said,

smiling 
happily 
to 
himself
like 
a 
child, 
he 
fell 
into 
a 
deep, 
youthful 
slumber.
