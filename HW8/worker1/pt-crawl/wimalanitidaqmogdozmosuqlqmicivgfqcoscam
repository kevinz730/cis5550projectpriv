farther 
and
farther?</h1>I 
feel 
that<p>
I 
cannot 
vanish, 
since 
nothing 
vanishes 
in 
this
world, 
but 
that 
I 
shall 
always 
exist 
and 
always 
have 
existed. 
I 
feel
that 
beyond 
me 
and 
above 
me 
there 
are 
spirits, 
and 
that 
in 
this 
world
there 
is 
truth."

"Yes, 
that 
is 
Herder's 
theory," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"but 
it 
is
not 
that 
which 
can 
convince 
me, 
dear 
friend-life 
and 
death 
are 
what
convince. 
What 
convinces 
is 
when 
one 
sees 
a 
being 
dear 
to 
one, 
bound
up 
with 
one's 
own 
life, 
before<p>
whom 
one 
was 
to 
blame 
and 
had 
hoped 
to
make 
it 
right" 
(Prince 
Andrew's 
voice 
trembled 
and 
he 
turned 
away),
"and 
suddenly 
that 
being 
is 
seized 
with 
pain, 
suffers, 
and 
ceases 
to
exist.... 
Why? 
It 
cannot 
be 
that 
there 
is 
no 
answer. 
And 
I 
believe 
there
is.... 
That's 
what 
convinces, 
that 
is 
what 
has 
convinced 
me," 
said
Prince 
Andrew.

"Yes, 
yes, 
of 
course," 
said 
Pierre, 
"isn't 
that 
what 
I'm
saying?"

"No. 
All 
I 
say 
is 
that 
it 
is 
not 
argument 
that 
convinces 
me 
of 
the
necessity 
of 
a 
future 
life, 
but 
this: 
when 
you 
go 
hand 
in 
hand 
with
someone 
and 
all 
at 
once 
that 
person 
vanishes 
there, 
into 
nowhere, 
and
you 
yourself 
are 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Fcn8HQTp6BPULq5fOHvf.html">left</a> 
facing 
that 
abyss, 
and 
look 
in. 
And 
I 
have 
looked
in...."

"Well, 
that's 
it 
then! 
You 
know 
that 
there 
is 
a 
there 
and 
there 
is 
a
Someone? 
There 
is 
the 
future 
life. 
The 
Someone 
is-God."

Prince 
Andrew 
did 
not 
reply. 
The 
carriage 
and 
horses 
had 
long 
since 
been
taken 
off, 
onto 
the 
farther 
bank, 
and 
reharnessed. 
The 
sun 
had 
sunk 
half
below 
the 
horizon 
and 
an 
evening 
frost 
was 
starring 
the 
puddles 
near
the 
ferry, 
but 
Pierre 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mT8QrO73Bh.html">and</a> 
Andrew, 
to 
the 
astonishment 
of 
the 
footmen,
coachmen, 
and 
ferrymen, 
still 
stood 
on 
the 
raft 
and 
talked.

"If 
there 
is 
a 
God 
and 
future 
life, 
there 
is 
truth 
and 
good, 
and
man's 
highest 
happiness 
consists 
in 
striving 
to 
attain 
them. 
We 
must
live, 
we 
must 
love, 
and 
we 
must 
believe 
that 
we 
live 
not 
<a href="/cZl/Gt84qEo4.html">only</a> 
today 
on
this 
scrap 
of 
earth, 
but 
have 
lived 
and 
shall 
live 
forever, 
there, 
in
the 
Whole," 
said 
Pierre, 
and 
he 
pointed 
to 
the 
sky.

Prince 
Andrew 
stood 
leaning 
on 
the 
railing 
of 
the 
raft 
listening 
to
Pierre, 
and 
he 
gazed 
with 
his 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
the 
red 
reflection 
of 
the
sun 
gleaming 
on 
the 
blue 
waters. 
There 
was 
perfect 
stillness. 
Pierre
became 
silent. 
The 
raft 
had 
long 
since 
stopped 
and 
only 
the 
waves 
of 
the
current 
beat 
softly 
against 
it 
below. 
Prince 
Andrew 
felt 
as 
if 
the 
sound
of 
the 
waves 
kept 
up 
a 
refrain 
to 
Pierre's 
words, 
whispering:

"It 
is 
true, 
believe 
it."

He 
sighed, 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/su4KqZP7zlSDj6CNkX.html">glanced</a> 
with 
a 
radiant, 
childlike, 
tender 
look 
at
Pierre's 
face, 
flushed 
and 
rapturous, 
but 
yet 
shy 
before<p>
his 
superior
friend.

"Yes, 
if 
it 
only 
were 
so!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew. 
"However, 
it 
is
time 
to 
get 
on," 
he 
added, 
and, 
stepping 
off 
the 
raft, 
he 
looked 
up
at 
the 
sky 
to 
which 
Pierre 
had 
pointed, 
and 
for 
the 
first 
time 
since
Austerlitz 
saw 
that 
high, 
everlasting 
sky
