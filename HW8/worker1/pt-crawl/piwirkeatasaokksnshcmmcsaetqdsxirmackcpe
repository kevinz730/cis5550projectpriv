fancied 
the 
sovereign 
saying. 
And
passing 
people 
who 
looked 
after 
him 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/PX8PUEsy69.html">with</a> 
curiosity, 
he 
entered 
the 
porch
of 
the 
Emperor's 
house.

A 
broad 
staircase 
led 
straight 
up 
from 
the 
entry, 
and 
to 
the 
right 
he
saw 
a 
closed 
door. 
Below, 
under 
the 
staircase, 
was 
a 
door 
leading 
to 
the
lower 
floor.

"Whom 
do 
you 
want?" 
someone 
inquired.

"To 
hand 
in 
a 
letter, 
a 
petition, 
to 
His 
Majesty," 
said 
Nicholas,
with 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/UQ9sGG5O4Pm.html">tremor</a> 
in 
his 
voice.

"A 
petition? 
This 
way, 
to 
the 
officer 
on 
duty" 
(he 
was 
shown 
the
door 
leading 
downstairs),<p>
"only 
it 
won't 
be 
accepted."

On 
hearing 
this 
indifferent 
voice, 
Rostov 
grew 
frightened 
at 
what
he 
was 
doing; 
the 
thought 
of 
meeting 
the 
Emperor 
at 
any 
moment 
was 
so
fascinating 
and 
consequently 
so 
alarming 
that 
he 
was 
ready 
to 
run 
away,
but 
the 
official 
who 
had 
questioned 
him 
opened 
the 
door, 
and 
Rostov
entered.

A 
short 
stout 
man 
of 
about 
thirty, 
in 
white 
breeches 
and 
high 
boots 
and
a 
batiste 
shirt 
that 
he 
had 
evidently 
only 
just 
put 
on, 
standing 
in 
that
room, 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ex5AyyZE1suDcq7kQqNG.html">and</a> 
his 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/aJ2zr21qRU.html">valet</a> 
was 
buttoning 
on 
to 
the 
back 
of 
his 
breeches 
a
new 
pair 
of 
handsome 
silk-embroidered 
braces 
that, 
for 
some 
reason,
attracted 
Rostov's 
attention. 
This 
man 
was 
speaking 
to 
someone 
in 
the
adjoining 
room.

"A 
good 
figure 
and 
in 
her 
first 
bloom,"<p>
he 
was 
saying, 
but 
on 
seeing
Rostov, 
he 
stopped 
short 
and 
frowned.

"What 
is 
it? 
A 
petition?"

"What 
is 
it?" 
asked 
the 
person 
in 
the 
other 
room.

"Another 
petitioner," 
answered 
the 
man 
with 
the 
braces.

"Tell 
him 
to 
come 
later. 
He'll 
be 
coming 
out 
directly, 
we 
must
go."

"Later... 
later! 
Tomorrow. 
It's 
too 
late..."

Rostov 
turned 
and 
was 
about 
to 
go, 
but 
the 
man 
in 
the 
braces 
stopped
him.

"Whom 
have 
you 
come 
from? 
Who 
are
