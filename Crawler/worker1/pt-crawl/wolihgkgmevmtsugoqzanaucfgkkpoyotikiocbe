href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220209104703/https://www.theguardian.com/world/taiwan" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Taiwan</a>, who has died aged 93, played an important role during Taiwan's transition from a one-party state under martial law to a semi-democracy. His greatest contribution to political life in Taiwan was during the 1970s and 80s, when he occupied key positions in the ruling nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) party, and in the reformist government under Lee's great political mentor, President Chiang Ching-kuo, son of Chiang Kai-shek.</p><p class="dcr-1wj398p">Lee was born on the mainland, in Hubei province, central <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220209104703/https://www.theguardian.com/world/china" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">China</a>, and was educated at Fudan University in Shanghai, where he studied law, and then, in the late 1940s, at Columbia University, New York. On the defeat of the nationalists by the communists in 1949, he moved to Taiwan island, where the Republic of China continued in power. The mass movement of so many mainlanders to Taiwan, while it ensured the survival of the Chiang Kai-shek regime, came at a high price for the native Taiwanese, whose initial opposition to such a huge inward migration was met with brutal suppression. In his early career in the KMT government, Lee served as head of the China Youth Corps and Chair of the National Youth Commission. Later, he was the first president of the National Sun Yat-Sen University.</p><p id="sign-in-gate"></p><p class="dcr-1wj398p">It was only in the 1970s that Chiang, elevated to be president three years before his father's death, realised that Taiwan's loss of its seat at the UN in 1971 to the People's Republic of China, and its international isolation, meant that its political structures needed to be strengthened. Lee articulated these new objectives, in a speech for which he was criticised by hardliners in the KMT, as pushing for democracy and promoting freedom of the press. Over the next two decades, these aims would be achieved.</p><p class="dcr-1wj398p">As director general of the Organisation Department, in charge of key personnel appointments in the KMT (1972-77), Lee oversaw a large influx of native Taiwanese into prominent party positions, in a quest to increase its legitimacy to a population who still regarded the KMT as a political organisation for outsiders. Some of those he helped in their early career, such as Lien Chen, were to enjoy distinguished careers – Lien stood in the presidential election against Chen Shui-bian in 2004, and now serves as the emeritus president of the KMT. A riot against accusations of vote-rigging in Chung-li city in 1977, for which he took responsibility, ended this period of Lee's career.</p><p class="dcr-1wj398p">He returned in 1984 as minister of education during the critical final phase of Chiang's period as president, when some of the most significant moves were made towards creating a full democracy and allowing the lifting of martial law and organisation of genuinely independent . Lee lifted a number of restrictions on the activities of students, and was part of the group that supported Taiwan-born Lee Teng-hui when he became president after Chiang's death in 1988. His reward for this was to be appointed premier, and head of government, for a year until 1990. Disagreements with Lee Teng-hui led to Lee's departure from office.</p><p class="dcr-1wj398p">During the next two decades, he maintained a low profile as a more conservative member of the KMT. Taiwan progressed towards democracy far more quickly than many expected, holding its first genuinely competitive elections in 1996, and seeing the transfer of power from the KMT to the Democratic Progressive party (DPP) in 2000 and 2004. Power returned to the KMT in 2008.</p><p class="dcr-1wj398p">Lee is survived by four children. Two of them, Diane Lee and Lee Ching-hua, are legislators and public figures in Taiwan.</p><span class="dcr-1plqgus"><footer><p><em> <span data-dcr-style="bullet"></span> </em>Lee Huan, politician,
